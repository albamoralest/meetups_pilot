== Biography ==
Gunter was an original member of The Platters. He had recorded with the yet-unnamed Platters, singing back-up on Big Jay McNeely's recording "Nervous Man Nervous" on Federal Records in 1953. Gunter also was a member of The Flairs and The Coasters. The title song from the 1957 Susan Oliver film, The Green Eyed Blonde, was sung by Gunter. Will "Dub" Jones and Gunter joined The Coasters as replacements for Bobby Nunn and Leon Hughes in early 1958. After Gunter left the Coasters, he toured with Dinah Washington. In 1963, he formed his own Coasters group; they were usually billed as "The Fabulous Coasters". Gunter made several solo singles in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including a cover version of Sam Cooke's "You Send Me" on Dot Records in 1957.
In 1987, he was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame along with the rest of The Coasters.
Cornell's sister, Shirley Gunter, also recorded with The Flairs and released with the Queens and in solo in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Ace Records released a compilation album in 2006 of Shirley's recordings from the 1950s entitled Oop Shoop: The Flair and Modern Recordings 1953–1957.
Another sister, Gloria Gunter, recorded the singles "Move On Out" and "Your Love Reminds Me" (Arch #1610) in 1959. "Move On Out" was an answer to The Coasters' hit "Yakety Yak", on which Cornell sang. Both sides of the record were made available on CD in 2006.  "Move On Out" appears on Rock 'n' Roll Mamas (Popcorn #6004), and "Your Love Reminds Me" appears on Rare Female Doo Wops (Popcorn #6005).
Gunter (who was gay and in later years preferred to spell his name Cornell Gunther) was in the process of making a new comeback, when an unknown assassin shot him in his car in Las Vegas, Nevada on February 26, 1990 (some files say February 27). The survivors of his group continue to tour as "The Original Cornell Gunter's Coasters Inc."
