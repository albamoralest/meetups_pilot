1.0,2,28,HM,"He presented it in Paris in December 1846, but it played to half-empty houses, despite excellent reviews, some from critics not usually well disposed to his music. The highly romantic subject was out of step with the times, and one sympathetic reviewer observed that there was an unbridgeable gap between the composer's conception of art and that of the Paris public."

,4,28,HT,"His other foreign tours during the rest of the 1840s included Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Germany."

,18,32,HT,In 1867 Berlioz received the news that his son had died in Havana of yellow fever.
,19,32,HT,"Macdonald suggests that Berlioz may have sought distraction from his grief by going ahead with a planned series of concerts in St Petersburg and Moscow, but far from rejuvenating him, the trip sapped his remaining strength."

,6,44,HT,"By that time the composer had added to its two choruses a part for massed children's voices, inspired by hearing a choir of 6,500 children singing in St Paul's Cathedral during his London trip in 1851."
,7,44,HT,"A cantata for double chorus and large orchestra in honour of Napoleon III, L'Impériale, described by Berlioz as ""en style énorme"", was played several times at the 1855 exhibition, but has subsequently remained a rarity."

,2,46,HT,"He suppressed some of his early songs, and his last publication, in 1865, was the 33 Mélodies, collecting into one volume all his songs that he chose to preserve."
2.0,3,46,HM,"He suppressed some of his early songs, and his last publication, in 1865, was the 33 Mélodies, collecting into one volume all his songs that he chose to preserve. Some of them, such as ""Hélène"" and ""Sara la baigneuse"", exist in versions for four voices with accompaniment, and there are others for two or three voices."
,4,46,HT,"Berlioz later orchestrated some of the songs originally written with piano accompaniment, and some, such as ""Zaïde"" and ""Le Chasseur danois"" were written with alternative piano or orchestral parts."

,8,46,HT,"The songs remain on the whole among the least known of Berlioz's works, and John Warrack suggests that Schumann identified why this might be so: the shape of the melodies is, as usual with Berlioz, not straightforward, and to those used to the regular four-bar phrases of French (or German) song this is an obstacle to appreciation."

,2,51,HT,"Of those who wrote for and against Berlioz's music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, among the most outspoken were musical amateurs such as the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong, who called the composer's music variously ""flatulent"", ""rubbish"", and ""the work of a tipsy chimpanzee"", and, in the pro-Berlioz camp, the poet and journalist Walter J. Turner, who wrote what Cairns calls ""exaggerated eulogies""."

,5,51,HT,"His successors were Tom S. Wotton, author of a 1935 biography, and Julien Tiersot, who wrote numerous scholarly articles on Berlioz and began the collection and editing of the composer's letters, a process eventually completed in 2016, eighty years after Tiersot's death."
,6,51,HT,"In the early 1950s the best-known Berlioz scholar was Jacques Barzun, a protégé of Wotton, and, like him, strongly hostile to many of Boschot's conclusions, which they saw as unfairly critical of the composer."
,7,51,HT,Barzun's study was published in 1950.
,8,51,HT,"He was accused at the time by the musicologist Winton Dean of being excessively partisan, and refusing to admit failings and unevenness in Berlioz's music; more recently he has been credited by the musicologist Nicholas Temperley with playing a major part in improving the climate of musical opinion towards Berlioz."

,1,57,HT,"By 1963 Cairns, viewing Berlioz's greatness as firmly established, felt able to advise anyone writing on the subject, ""Do not keep harping on the 'strangeness' of Berlioz's music; you will no longer carry the reader with you."
