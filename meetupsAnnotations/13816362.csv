,1,2,HT,"The passing of time makes it increasingly difficult to verify or refute the various versions of his life and career, since many of his former close associates like his Australian colleagues Max Moore and Alan Heffernan are now deceased."
,2,2,N,
,3,2,HT,"There are also notable periods for which there is little or no information about his whereabouts and activities, such as his mysterious trip to America in 1957–58, including his alleged ""nervous breakdown"" and extended hospitalisation in Hawaii, his movements and activities after final departure from Australia in 1962, and his death in London in 1963."
,0,3,HT,"According to the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Gordon was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1923, and educated at Highland Park High School, Highland Park, Michigan and at the University of Miami, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1944."

,3,4,HT,"For unknown reasons, Gordon left America sometime in the mid-1940s and reportedly worked in several 'colourful' overseas business enterprises - in Lima, Peru, he was involved in a direct mail business, and later he moved to Havana, Cuba, where he exported cigars and roses to the United States and booked American acts into the famous Tropicana Club, Havana's famous open-air nightclub."
,4,4,HT,"The dating of his involvement with the Tropicana is uncertain, although it is possible that he was working there during the period that the Miami Mafia took control of the club in 1946."

In this case, although there are several key elements in common, there are at least three extant versions of his life during this time, each of which differ notably in the details of events and locations."
,2,5,HT,"According to one version, he opened a chain of sixty ""House of Grams"" and ""House of TV"" retail stores in the US, but his gimmicky sales pitches supposedly angered the powerful US Electrical Retailers' Association, and Gordon was allegedly forced out of business, incurring a heavy financial loss."
,3,5,HT,"It was then, at the suggestion of his friend Arthur Schurgin, a Detroit promoter, that Gordon decided to explore the possibility of presenting big-name acts in Australia."
,4,5,N,
,5,5,HT,"In one account, Gordon claimed that his retail venture was successful, and that he  eventually sold it for US$550,000 (a very considerable amount at that time, and  apparently the largest single sum he ever made during his life) but Gordon further claimed that he had subsequently lost the entire fortune within three years, backing two unsuccessful Broadway productions and several loss-making music tours."
,6,5,N,
,7,5,HM,"In a third (and perhaps least likely) version of these events, also recounted by Max Moore, Gordon claimed that in early 1953 he accepted a bet from some influential New York business people, who doubted his claims that he could start with nothing and become a success."
,8,5,HT,He was challenged to prove himself and given a one-way ticket to Canada.
,9,5,HT,"Basing himself in Toronto, he moved into a luxury penthouse hotel suite, rented several retail properties and began advertising his new venture."
,10,5,HT,"Stocking the stores with TV sets, Gordon hired staff and used his proven hard-sell tactics and by the end of the first week he managed to make enough money to pay his bills; a short time later he apparently sold the business for a handsome profit."

,0,8,HT,"From the springboard of his initial marketing success, Gordon then established himself as a music concert promoter in Australia."
,1,8,N,
,2,8,HM,"He was keen to minimise his tax liability—Australian tax law in those days charged a double rate on performers who worked in both Australia and the United States—so he hired a skilled accountant, Alan Heffernan, who went on to become his permanent accountant and general manager, as well becoming a close friend and confidante."
,3,8,HT,Heffernan played a major role in Gordon's subsequent success and he helped to keep the company going through the mysterious period in 1958 when Gordon disappeared for almost a year.

3.0,4,11,HM,"Gordon negotiated a deal with venue owners Stadiums Limited for the use of their venues in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, at a cost of AU£500 per session, and arranged the hire of Centennial Hall in Adelaide and suitable venues in other major cities. Stadiums Ltd was a famous Australian company that had been purchased in 1916 by colourful Melbourne business identity John Wren, whose life and career was the inspiration for John West, the central character in Frank Hardy's controversial novel Power Without Glory."
,5,11,N,
,6,11,HT,"Through the first half of the 20th century these halls, which were originally built as sporting arenas, had hosted many major Australian boxing and wrestling matches, but they were ideal for Gordon's purposes since their ""in-the-round"" arenas were at the time the largest indoor venues in Australia's three east coast capital cities."
,7,11,HT,"Thanks to the deal struck by Gordon, these venues  - especially the Sydney Stadium - became indelibly associated with the ""Big Show"" tours of the 1950s."
,0,12,N,
,1,12,HT,"The first Big Show tours in 1954 and early 1955 were all presented at the old West Melbourne Stadium, but it was destroyed by fire in the early hours of 24 January 1955, just before the last two Melbourne concerts of the first Australian tour by Frank Sinatra, whose shows had to be hastily relocated to the Melbourne Town Hall."
,2,12,HT,"The venue was soon rebuilt as Melbourne Festival Hall and was reopened in mid-1956, in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, but in the interim Gordon was obliged to use a range of other Melbourne venues including the Town Hall, Leggett's Ballroom in Prahran, the Royal Exhibition Building, and the Palais Theatre in St Kilda, until the Olympics had ended and the new Festival Hall was again available for regular concert bookings."

,1,14,HM,"Because of his extensive connections in his homeland, and the musical trends of the day, virtually all the imported headlining acts on Gordon's Big Show tours were Americans."
,2,14,HT,"Early Big Show lineups did not feature a local support act, but due to both local Musicians Union rules and the high cost (relative to today) of transporting large backing ensembles to Australia from the US, a local orchestra or band was typically employed to provide backing for the visitors."
,3,14,HT,For the first four Big Show tours of 1954 the visiting artists were backed by the local Wally Norman Swing Band; Norman was an accomplished jazz trumpet played and arranger who had previously played in the band led by Les Welch.
,4,14,HT,"For most subsequent tours 1955-59 for which a larger band was required this was provided by an orchestra led by Australian bandleader and arranger Dennis Collinson, who was Lee Gordon's musical director from 1955 until Collinson's death in 1959."

,1,18,N,
,2,18,N,
,3,18,HT,"It was also an historic moment in the career of Artie Shaw - he had visited Australia once before, during WWII, but his 1943 concerts were restricted to service personnel only, so this 1954 tour was to be the first and only chance most local fans had to see him in concert."
,4,18,HT,"And, as Shaw indicated in press interviews at the time, he was to retire from performing altogether later that year to concentrate on writing."
,5,18,HT,"Although he did eventually return to performance for a few years in the 1980s, this was as conductor only, so his 1954 Australian tour was the very last time in his career that he fronted a band as clarinettist."

0.0,1,19,HM,"The Big Show tour played at the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane Stadiums to a rapturous reception, although it was also marred by a racial controversy. A contemporary article in the Melbourne Argus newspaper reported that the first two concerts of the tour in Sydney on 23 and 24 July featured only Artie Shaw and Buddy Rich, because Fitzgerald did not arrive in time for these Sydney shows."
,2,19,HT,"Although the Argus report quoted a local spokesperson for Pan-Am, who denied that they had been refused seats because of a ""color bar"", that was indeed the cause - and this was confirmed in December 1954, when Fitzgerald, Henry, Lewis, and Granz jointly filed a civil suit against Pan-Am for racial discrimination."
,3,19,HM,"As revealed by the original court documents (now in the U.S. Archives) Fitzgerald et al. alleged that Pan-American Airlines officials in Honolulu had ordered the singer and two of her three travelling companions (her assistant and cousin Georgiana Henry and her accompanist John Lewis) to leave the plane, even though they all had first-class tickets, and that they were even refused permission to re-board the aircraft to retrieve their luggage and clothing - although her (white) manager Norman Granz was not similarly treated, thus making it obvious that their treatment was based on their colour."
,4,19,N,
,0,20,HT,"As a result of the incident, Fitzgerald and her band were stranded in Honolulu for three days until they could board another flight to Australia and they missed the first two concerts of the tour, so Big Show had to organise two additional free shows in Sydney on 30 and 31 July to compensate ticket-holders, and an additional scheduled concert in Newcastle featuring Fitzgerald only also had to be cancelled after she fell ill."

The Argus article noted that Shaw and Rich's Sydney performances were enthusiastically received, but that Shaw (who was famous for his perfectionism) took the unusual step of stopping the music halfway through the opening number, due to mistakes in the performance by his Australian backing ensemble, the Wally Norman Orchestra, although he was quoted as explaining to the audience:"

Of particular note is the report that the recent Fitzgerald/Shaw/Rich tour had set a new box office record in Australia and had grossed US103,000 over 13 performances."
,2,23,HT,The article also records that the heads of this promotion syndicate were Lee Gordon and his old friends Arthur Schurgin and Benn F. Reyes.
,3,23,HT,"Reyes was a former journalist and veteran publicist with extensive experience in the Hollywood film industry; after his collaboration with Gordon he went on to become Vice President of Polaris Pictures, the production company set up by Stanley Kubrick, and Reyes worked closely with Kubrick on his three major films of the 1960s, Lolita, Dr. Strangelove and 2001:"

,5,23,HT,"Reyes died suddenly in 1968, aged 53, shortly after the release of 2001."
,6,23,HM,"Schurgin (1920-2003) was a veteran Detroit-based concert promoter who brought The Beatles to Detroit in 1964 and promoted local appearances by Harry Belafonte, The Monkees, Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Artie Shaw and Buddy Rich."
,7,23,HM,How Gordon developed his business relationship with Reyes and Schurgin is not known but his evidently close connection to Schurgin suggests that Gordon was also based in Detroit for some time and lends some credence to the claim  that he was born there (as some sources indicate) although this presently remains unconfirmed.

,0,25,HT,"Gordon's second tour was headlined by popular American singer Johnnie Ray in August 1954, on which Ray was supported by popular American film and stage dancers  Peggy Ryan & Ray McDonald, and standup comedian Dave Barry, and this proved to be the turning point in Gordon's brief career."
,1,25,HT,"A week after tickets went on sale, receipts were so poor that Gordon faced ruin—according to Max Moore, visits by overseas acts were so rare at that time that many people thought these early tour promotions were hoaxes."
,2,25,HT,"In an effort to save the tour, Gordon fell back on his marketing skills and launched a promotional blitz — he had millions of 8""x8"" leaflets printed, which entitled the holder to a free extra ticket for every ticket sold, and had these ""twofer"" leaflets dropped from planes over Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane."
,3,25,N,
,4,25,HT,"Remarkably, although some four million of these promotional leaflets were printed, Powerhouse Museum curator and music historian Peter Cox revealed in 2010 that he had never seen one, and the museum did not have one in its collection."
,5,25,HT,The tour was reportedly a huge financial success - the Melbourne Age reported that Ray earned £30 per minute for each of his sixteen concerts and that he had three tuxedos and several shirts and ties ripped to pieces by emotional fans.
,6,25,HT,"Police posted extra officers at Mascot airport for his departure from Australia but the extra police and Ray's two ""burly"" personal bodyguards turned out not to be needed and he left the country quietly at the end of the tour."

,0,27,HT,Gordon's next promotion was another landmark in Australian entertainment - the first Australian tour by jazz legend Louis Armstrong and his group in October/November 1954.
,1,27,N,
,2,27,HM,"Since that time, according to Australian jazz historian Andrew Bissett, there had been an effective ban on African American groups entering Australia, and given that the White Australia Policy was still very much in force in 1954, the fact that Gordon was able to pull this tour off was a remarkable feat which merits further investigation."
,0,28,HT,"Gordon's final tour of 1954 in December starred The Andrews Sisters and African-American singer Billy Daniels, who was famous for his million-selling signature song ""That Old Black Magic""."

The special train would take fans to Sydney's Central Station, from where they would then be driven direct to the Sydney Stadium in chartered buses."
,3,29,HT,"Gordon was quoted as saying that he wanted to test local interest in his Big Show tours in Newcastle, that if it was successful, he would charter another special train from the upcoming Nat King Cole tour, and that he would consider scheduling dates for future tours in Newcastle itself."
,0,31,HT,Gordon and Big Show made local showbiz history during 1955 with no less than six first-time Australian tours by major American acts.
,1,31,HT,Gordon kicked off the year with Nat King Cole (supported by singer June Christy and comedy duo Dan Rowan and Dick Martin) in early January.
,2,31,HT,"This was followed only a couple of weeks later by the first Frank Sinatra tour, then the first Frankie Laine tour in February, the landmark second Johnnie Ray tour in March, actress and singer Betty Hutton in May, and then two of the top names in American comedy - Bob Hope in late May-early June, and Abbott and Costello in June."
,0,32,HT,"Although most of the musical tours were highly successful, and the Johnnie Ray tour was a smash hit that set a new box office record that would stand for the next decade, Big Show tour manager Max Moore later recorded that the company lost heavily on the two comedy tours."

,3,34,HT,"But following his signing to Capitol Records and his teaming with arranger Nelson Riddle in early 1953, Sinatra had found renewed form and a deeper artistry."
,4,34,HT,"By the time he arrived in Australia in January 1955 he was on the brink of the peak phase of his 'new' career, and within months he would record and release of two of his greatest albums, In The Wee Small Hours (his first 12"" LP), and Songs For Swinging Lovers."

,3,37,HT,"Although Ray was not a rock'n'roll performer, his distinctive and highly emotive style was an important bridge between the mainstream popular music of the '40s and early '50s and the emerging rock'n'roll genre."
,4,37,HT,"He also had a great influence on Australia's first homegrown rock'n'roll star, Johnny O'Keefe, who in fact had started his career as a Johnny Ray impersonator."
,5,37,HT,O'Keefe saw Ray perform live several times on this tour and studied his idol carefully.
,6,37,HT,"In the event, Ray's second Australian tour proved to be far bigger than his first—he was mobbed by 10,000 fans at Sydney Airport and he set an Australian record for ticket sales that was not broken until the arrival of The Beatles in 1964, Ray played 24 sell-out shows at the 11,000-seat Sydney Stadium, equal to well over 260,000 ticket in Sydney alone, which is quite remarkable considering that the population of Sydney at the time was something less than 2 million."

,12,37,HT,"Ray denied that the story was a publicity stunt, but it was probably manufactured by Gordon's publicist and/or Ray's management, because he was actually a 'closeted' homosexual (although his sexuality was not officially confirmed until some years after his death in 1990)."

,3,50,HM,"These included Presley's Northeast tour of March 1957, and his subsequent West Coast tour of September 1957, which included dates in San Diego, Oakland, his first concert in Hollywood and his first three-date visit to Hawaii; on this latter tour, Guralnick reports, Gordon did ""his usual good job"" of promotion."

,2,92,HT,"Except for a few visits during World War II (e.g. a restricted wartime tour by Artie Shaw), virtually none of the top names in American popular music had ever visited Australia before the Gordon tours, due to a combination of factors including distance, cost (compounded by Australia's punitive taxation laws of the time) and particularly because of a long-standing de facto ban on African-American performers."
