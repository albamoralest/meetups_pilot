,0,1,HT,"Grove states that while details of his life are lacking, some documents of the time mention a Gautier d'Espinal active between 1232 and 1272, but it is uncertain if this is the trouvère, as some of the songs attributed to him suggest an earlier date."
,1,1,HT,Most likely Gautier was one of the seigneurs of the city of Epinal.
