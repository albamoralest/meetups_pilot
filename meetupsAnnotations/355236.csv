,2,23,N,
,3,23,HT,"Although when he chose, Massenet could write noisy and dissonant scenes – in 1885 Bernard Shaw called him ""one of the loudest of modern composers"" – much of his music is soft and delicate."
,4,23,HT,"Hostile critics have seized on this characteristic, but the article on Massenet in the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians observes that in the best of his operas this sensual side ""is balanced by strong dramatic tension (as in Werther), theatrical action (as in Thérèse), scenic diversion (as in Esclarmonde), or humour (as in Le portrait de Manon).""Massenet's Parisian audiences were greatly attracted by the exotic in music, and Massenet willingly obliged, with musical evocations of far-flung places or times long past."

,7,30,HT,"Of the four works categorised by Irvine and Grove as oratorios, only one, La terre promise (1900), was written for church performance."
