,16,17,N,
,17,17,HT,"Jeux was unfortunate in its timing: two weeks after the premiere, in March 1913, Diaghilev presented the first performance of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, a sensational event that monopolised discussion in musical circles, and effectively sidelined Jeux along with Fauré's Pénélope, which had opened a week before."

,1,20,HT,"Later commentators have rated some of the late works more highly than Newman and other contemporaries did, but much of the music for which Debussy is best known is from the middle years of his career."
,2,20,HT,"The analyst David Cox wrote in 1974 that Debussy, admiring Wagner's attempts to combine all the creative arts, ""created a new, instinctive, dreamlike world of music, lyrical and pantheistic, contemplative and objective – a kind of art, in fact, which seemed to reach out into all aspects of experience."""

,2,24,N,
,3,24,HT,"His early mélodies, inspired by Marie Vasnier, are more virtuosic in character than his later works in the genre, with extensive wordless vocalise; from the Ariettes oubliées (1885–1887) onwards he developed a more restrained style."
,4,24,HT,"He wrote his own poems for the Proses lyriques (1892–1893) but, in the view of the musical scholar Robert Orledge, ""his literary talents were not on a par with his musical imagination""."
,5,24,HT,"The musicologist Jacques-Gabriel Prod'homme wrote that, together with La Demoiselle élue, the Ariettes oubliées and the Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire (1889) show ""the new, strange way which the young musician will hereafter follow""."

,9,24,N,
,10,24,N,
,11,24,HT,"In a 2004 study, Mark DeVoto comments that Debussy's early works are harmonically no more adventurous than existing music by Fauré; in a 2007 book about the piano works, Margery Halford observes that Two Arabesques (1888–1891) and ""Rêverie"" (1890) have ""the fluidity and warmth of Debussy's later style"" but are not harmonically innovative."
,12,24,HT,"Halford cites the popular ""Clair de Lune"" (1890), the third of the four movements of Suite Bergamasque, as a transitional work pointing towards the composer's mature style."

,4,26,HT,"The suite Pour le piano (1894–1901) is, in Halford's view, one of the first examples of the mature Debussy as a composer for the piano: ""a major landmark ... and an enlargement of the use of piano sonorities""."
,5,26,HT,"In the String Quartet (1893), the gamelan sonorities Debussy had heard four years earlier are recalled in the pizzicatos and cross-rhythms of the scherzo."
