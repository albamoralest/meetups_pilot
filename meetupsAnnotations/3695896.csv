,1,2,HT,"He made the first stereo recording of Wagner's Ring Cycle in 1955, as well as a so-called ""second cycle"" with Mödl, rather than Astrid Varnay, as Brünnhilde."
,2,2,HT,"Mödl's accounts of Brünnhilde, from the 1953 Ring as well as the 1955 ""second cycle,"" are her only recordings of the role other than Wilhelm Furtwängler's 1953 Rome Ring and commercial Walküre in 1954."
,3,2,HT,"Among his other recordings, his outstanding interpretations of Wagner's Lohengrin at the 1953 Bayreuth Festival released on Decca-London and Weber's Der Freischütz made in 1958 for EMI, as well as a 'live' set of Richard Strauss's Arabella (featuring Lisa della Casa and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau) made in 1963 for DG are still considered among the best versions."
