,1,15,HT,"Nono was to return to such anti-fascist subject matter again, as in Diario polacco; Composizione no. 2 (1958–59), whose background included a journey through the Nazi concentration camps, and the ""azione scenica"" Intolleranza 1960, which caused a riot at its première in Venice, on 13 April 1961."

,2,18,HT,"Described as a ""stage-action""—Nono explicitly forbade the title of ""opera""—it utilizes an array of resources from large orchestra, chorus, tape, and loudspeakers to the ""magic lantern"" technique drawn from Meyerhold and Mayakovsky theatre practices of the 1920s to form a rich expressionist drama."
,3,18,HT,"Angelo Ripellino's libretto consisting of political slogans, poems, and quotations from Brecht and Sartre (including moments of Brechtian alienation), together with Nono's strident, anguished music, fully accords with the anti-capitalist fulmination the composer intended to communicate."
