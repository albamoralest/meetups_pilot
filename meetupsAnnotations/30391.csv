,1,44,HM,"Yet conflicts between the so-called Darmstadt school, which included composers like Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luigi Nono, Bruno Maderna, Karel Goeyvaerts, Luciano Berio and Gottfried Michael Koenig, soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, ""The Aging of the New Music"", where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique."
,2,44,N,

,0,46,N,
,1,46,HT,"Adorno's 1949 dictum—""To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric""—posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in Negative Dialectics, for example, he wrote that ""Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream"";  while in ""Commitment,"" he wrote in 1962 that the dictum ""expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature""—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture."
