,9,14,HT,"Although Hérold's name is associated in the public mind with the music for La Fille mal gardée, the score he wrote for the Opéra in 1828 differs substantially from that played in modern productions of the ballet."
,10,14,N,
,11,14,HT,"Later productions have added music by Peter Ludwig Hertel, and the most famous number in the piece, the clog dance, is a modern invention, based on one of Hertel's tunes, by John Lanchbery, who revised the whole score in 1959 for Frederick Ashton's production."

,1,16,HT,"In a 1904 survey of Hérold's work, Chouqet praised La Clochette for its abundance of new and fresh ideas, its stagecraft and original instrumentation."
,2,16,HT,"He added that although its immediate successors showed the composer's industry and fertility, operas like Le premier venu (1818), Les Troqueurs (1819), L' Amour platonique (1819), and L'Auteur mort et vivant (1820) had ""librettos that were neither interesting nor adapted for music"" ."
,3,16,HT,"Le Muletier (1823), however, is ""full of life and colour, and assured his reputation""."
,4,16,HT,"Chouqet adds that after the success of the lively Le Muletier it is puzzling that a man of Hérold's literary tastes and culture should have chosen to set dramas ""so tame and uninteresting as L'asthenie (1823), and Le Lapin blanc (1825)"": he concludes that Hérold's urge to compose led him to accept any libretto offered to him."

,2,17,HT,"Berlioz found things to praise in Zampa but thought Hérold lacked a style of his own, yet was neither Italian, nor French, nor German: ""His music strongly resembles those industrial products made in Paris according to processes invented elsewhere and slightly modified; it is Parisian music"", which, Berlioz thought, was why the Parisian middle classes loved it."
,3,17,HM,"But Betzwieser observes that Zampa's Romantic features made it highly successful outside France, and writing in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians the British critic Elizabeth Forbes commented in 1992, ""All the music is perfectly suited to its subject, while the portions devoted to Zampa and the statue are highly dramatic as well as melodious""."

,7,17,HT,"In a 2016 analysis of the score, Gérard Condé writes, ""Though doubtless derivative in certain respects, the score of Le Pré aux clercs went on to serve as a recipe book for the next half-century: Lecocq, Offenbach, Varney, Audran and even Bizet consulted it with profit, each to his own ends""."
,8,17,HT,"In the overture Hérold does not use themes from the opera, but ranges from an opening fugue to a quick march."
,9,17,HT,"Wagner and Smetana both knew the opera well, and in another 2016 analysis, Damien Colas writes that echoes of Le Pré aux clercs may be found in the former's Das Liebesverbot (1836) and the latter's The Bartered Bride (1866)."
