,0,6,HT,"Shepard and collaborators ""mapped"" large sets of stimuli using the rank order of likelihood that a person or organism would generalize the response to Stimulus A and give the same response to Stimulus B. To use an example from Shepard's 1987 paper proposing his ""Universal law of generalization"": will a bird ""generalize"" that it can eat a worm slightly different from a previous worm that it found was edible?Shepard used geometric and spatial metaphors to map a psychological space where ""distances"" between different stimuli were larger or smaller depending on whether the stimuli were, respectively, less or more similar."
