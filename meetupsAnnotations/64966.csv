,1,44,HT,"Sir Rudolf Bing, who remembered Callas as being ""monstrously fat"" in 1951, stated that after the weight loss, Callas was an ""astonishing, svelte, striking woman"" who ""showed none of the signs one usually finds in a fat woman who has lost weight: she looked as though she had been born to that slender and graceful figure, and had always moved with that elegance."""
,2,44,HT,"Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, while Rome's Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their ""physiologic pasta"", prompting Callas to file a lawsuit."
,3,44,N,
,4,44,HT,"Some believe that the loss of body mass made it more difficult for her to support her voice, triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade, while others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice, as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer."
