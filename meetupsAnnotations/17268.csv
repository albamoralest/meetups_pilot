,2,22,HT,"In August 1951, just after his first Darmstadt visit, Stockhausen began working with a form of athematic serial composition that rejected the twelve-tone technique of Schoenberg."
,3,22,N,
,4,22,HT,"Compositions from this phase include Kreuzspiel (1951), the Klavierstücke I–IV (1952—the fourth of this first set of four Klavierstücke, titled Klavierstück IV, is specifically cited by Stockhausen as an example of ""punctual music"", and the first (unpublished) versions of Punkte and Kontra-Punkte (1952)."
,5,22,HT,"However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his ""first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition"", that of ""group composition"", found in Stockhausen's works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career."

,9,22,N,
,10,22,HT,"Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new ""statistical"" criteria for composition, focussing attention on the aleatoric, directional tendencies of sound movement, ""the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state""."
,11,22,HT,"Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, ""The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc; the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space""."

,24,22,HT,"In Gruppen (1955–57), fanfares and passages of varying speed (superimposed durations based on the harmonic series) are occasionally flung between three full orchestras, giving the impression of movement in space."
,25,22,HT,"In his Kontakte for electronic sounds (optionally with piano and percussion) (1958–60), he achieved for the first time an isomorphism of the four parameters of pitch, duration, dynamics, and timbre."
,0,24,HT,"In 1960, Stockhausen returned to the composition of vocal music (for the first time since Gesang der Jünglinge) with Carré for four orchestras and four choirs."
,1,24,HT,"Two years later, he began an expansive cantata titled Momente (1962–64/69), for solo soprano, four choir groups and thirteen instrumentalists."
,2,24,HT,"In 1963, Stockhausen created Plus-Minus, ""2 × 7 pages for realisation"" containing basic note materials and a complex system of transformations to which those materials are to be subjected in order to produce an unlimited number of different compositions."
,3,24,HT,"Through the rest of the 1960s, he continued to explore such possibilities of ""process composition"" in works for live performance, such as Prozession (1967), Kurzwellen, and Spiral (both 1968), culminating in the verbally described ""intuitive music"" compositions of Aus den sieben Tagen (1968) and Für kommende Zeiten (1968–70)."

,7,24,HT,"He pioneered live electronics in Mixtur (1964/67/2003) for orchestra and electronics, Mikrophonie I (1964) for tam-tam, two microphones, two filters with potentiometers (6 players), Mikrophonie II (1965) for choir, Hammond organ, and four ring modulators, and Solo for a melody instrument with feedback (1966)."

,15,24,HT,"This was intended to be played for about five hours in the foyers and grounds of the Beethovenhalle auditorium complex in Bonn, before, after, and during a group of (in part simultaneous) concerts of his music in the auditoriums of the facility."

,18,24,N,
,0,26,HT,"Since the mid-1950s, Stockhausen had been developing concepts of spatialization in his works, not only in electronic music, such as the 5-channel Gesang der Jünglinge (1955–56) and Telemusik (1966), and 4-channel Kontakte (1958–60) and Hymnen (1966–67)."
,1,26,HT,Instrumental/vocal works like Gruppen for three orchestras (1955–57) and Carré for four orchestras and four choirs (1959–60) also exhibit this trait.

,0,28,HT,"Beginning with Mantra for two pianos and electronics (1970), Stockhausen turned to formula composition, a technique which involves the projection and multiplication of a single, double, or triple melodic-line formula."
,1,28,N,
,2,28,N,
,3,28,N,
,4,28,HT,"Some works from the 1970s did not employ formula technique—e.g., the vocal duet ""Am Himmel wandre ich"" (In the Sky I am Walking, one of the 13 components of the multimedia Alphabet für Liège, 1972, which Stockhausen developed in conversation with the British biophysicist and lecturer on mystical aspects of sound vibration Jill Purce), ""Laub und Regen"" (Leaves and Rain, from the theatre piece Herbstmusik (1974), the unaccompanied-clarinet composition Amour, and the choral opera Atmen gibt das Leben (Breathing Gives Life, 1974/77)—but nevertheless share its simpler, melodically oriented style."
,5,28,HT,"Two such pieces, Tierkreis (""Zodiac"", 1974–75) and In Freundschaft (In Friendship, 1977, a solo piece with versions for virtually every orchestral instrument), have become Stockhausen's most widely performed and recorded compositions."

,8,28,HT,"His orchestral composition Sub-Kontur (1974–75) quotes the formula of Stockhausen's Inori (1973–74), and he has also acknowledged the influence of Momente on this work."
,9,28,HM,"Other large works by Stockhausen from this decade include the orchestral Trans (1971) and two music-theatre compositions utilizing the Tierkreis melodies: Musik im Bauch (""Music in the Belly"") for six percussionists (1975), and the science-fiction ""opera"" Sirius (1975–77) for eight-channel electronic music with soprano, bass, trumpet, and bass clarinet, which has four different versions for the four seasons, each lasting over an hour and a half."
