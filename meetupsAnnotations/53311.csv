,0,7,HT,"Trained primarily in physiology, Helmholtz wrote on many other topics, ranging from theoretical physics, to the age of the Earth, to the origin of the Solar System."
,0,9,HT,Helmholtz's first academic position was as a teacher of Anatomy at the Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1848.
,1,9,HT,"He then moved to take a post of associate professor of physiology at the Prussian University of Königsberg, where he was appointed in 1849."
,2,9,HT,In 1855 he accepted a full professorship of anatomy and physiology at the University of Bonn.
,3,9,HT,"He was not particularly happy in Bonn, however, and three years later he transferred to the University of Heidelberg, in Baden, where he served as professor of physiology."
,4,9,HT,"In 1871 he accepted his final university position, as professor of physics at the Humboldt University in Berlin."
,0,13,HT,"Drawing on the earlier work of Sadi Carnot, Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron and James Prescott Joule, he postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, light, electricity and magnetism by treating them all as manifestations of a single force, or energy in today's terminology."
