,4,42,HT,"Other early songs such as ""Le vallon"" and ""Le soir"" (both to words by Lamartine, c. 1840) demonstrate Gounod's ability to cope with large-scale Romantic verse."
,5,42,HT,The songs of Gounod's middle and later years are in the main judged less impressive.
,6,42,N,
,7,42,HM,"Nevertheless, Johnson observes that some of the songs written during Gounod's stay in England in the 1870s are excellent of their kind, such as ""Oh happy home"" (words by Edward Maitland, 1872), ""If thou art sleeping, maiden"" (Longfellow, 1872 or 1873) and ""The Worker"" (Frederic Weatherly, 1873)."
