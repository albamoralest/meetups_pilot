"Vocal gimmicks aside, Stratos' mission was to free vocal expression from the slavery of language and pretty melodies.",0,16,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
"From the observation of his daughter Anastassia, he concluded that humans have enormous expressive potential that is progressively reduced to just a few socially appropriate functions during verbal development, such as language and harmonic singing.",1,16,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
He considered the exploration of vocal potential as a tool of psychological and political liberation.,2,16,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706

"Besides the official Area discography, for which Stratos is remembered, it is important to remember his solo works, a massive set of productions full of experimentation and vocal research.",0,18,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
His study of the voice used as a musical instrument carried him to reach for the limits of human capabilities.,1,18,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706

"Using various overtone singing and other extended techniques, he was able to perform diplophony, triplophony, and also quadrophony, the ability to produce two, three, and even four sounds simultaneously (multiphonic) using only the human voice as the musical instrument.",4,18,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
"In collaboration with the CNR of Padua, he has released many studies in ethnomusicology, vocal extensions and Asian music chant.",5,18,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
"Looking at what I have found during the emission, the vocal folds did not vibrate.",0,19,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
"The frequency (for a human voice) was very high (vocal folds do not succeed to exceed the frequencies of 1,000–1,200 Hz).",1,19,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
"In spite of that Demetrio obtained not one, but two not harmonic hisses, one that descended from 6,000 Hz, and the other that climbed from 3,000 Hz.",2,19,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
"Therefore, it could not be supposed that one hiss was the next harmonic of the other.",3,19,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706

"His research into the field of phonetics (Articulatory phonetics, Acoustic phonetics, and Auditory phonetics), and experimental poetry led to him freeing his voice of every naturalistic restraint, restoring its depth and dimension.",1,20,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
The result of this can be heard in the two recordings of his compositions Metrodora and Cantare la Voce where what sounds like an instrument is in fact his voice.,2,20,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706

"The western vocal hypertrophy has rendered almost insensitive the modern singer to the various aspects of the vocality, isolating him in the fencing of determined linguistic's structures",1,21,== Phonetics research studies ==,14688706
