"Paul Wilson lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bartók's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the Carpathian basin and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional harmonic functions associated with major and minor scales.",0,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
"Although Bartók claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use.",1,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
"George Perle (1955) and Elliott Antokoletz (1984) focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry.",2,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
Others view Bartók's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols.,3,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
"Richard Cohn (1988) argues that inversional symmetry is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads.",4,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
"Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring polymodal chromaticism, projected sets, privileged patterns, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone aggregate, octatonic scale (and alpha chord), the diatonic and heptatonia secunda seven-note scales, and less often the whole tone scale and the primary pentatonic collection.",5,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
"He rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his Second Violin Concerto, commenting that he ""wanted to show Schoenberg that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal"".",6,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527

"The aggregate is partitioned in the opening of the Third String Quartet with C♯–D–D♯–E in the accompaniment (strings) while the remaining pitch classes are used in the melody (violin 1) and more often as 7–35 (diatonic or ""white-key"" collection) and 5–35 (pentatonic or ""black-key"" collection) such as in no. 6 of the Eight Improvisations.",8,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527

"On the other hand, from as early as the Suite for piano, Op. 14 (1914), he occasionally employed a form of serialism based on compound interval cycles, some of which are maximally distributed, multi-aggregate cycles.",11,30,== Musical analysis ==,4527
