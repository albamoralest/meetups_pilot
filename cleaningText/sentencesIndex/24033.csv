"Lowell studied Mars extensively, making intricate drawings of the surface markings as he perceived them.",1,7,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033

"With these writings, Lowell more than anyone else popularized the long-held belief that these markings showed that Mars sustained intelligent life forms.",3,7,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033
"His works include a detailed description of what he termed the ""non-natural features"" of the planet's surface, including especially a full account of the ""canals,"" single and double; the ""oases,"" as he termed the dark spots at their intersections; and the varying visibility of both, depending partly on the Martian seasons.",4,7,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033
"He theorized that an advanced but desperate culture had built the canals to tap Mars' polar ice caps, the last source of water on an inexorably drying planet.",5,7,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033

"As a result, Lowell and his observatory were largely ostracized.",2,8,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033
"Although the consensus was that some actual features did exist which would account for these markings, in 1909 the sixty-inch Mount Wilson Observatory telescope in Southern California allowed closer observation of the structures Lowell had interpreted as canals, and revealed irregular geological features, probably the result of natural erosion.",3,8,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033
The existence of canal-like features was definitively disproved in the 1960s by NASA's Mariner missions.,4,8,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033
"Mariner 4, 6 and 7, and the Mariner 9 orbiter (1972), did not capture images of canals but instead showed a cratered Martian surface.",5,8,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033
"Today, the surface markings taken to be canals are regarded as an optical illusion.",6,8,== Life and career == | === Canals of Mars ===,24033

"Although Lowell was better known for his observations of Mars, he also drew maps of the planet Venus.",0,10,== Life and career == | === Venus spokes ===,24033
"He began observing Venus in detail in mid-1896 soon after the 61-centimetre (24-inch) Alvan Clark & Sons refracting telescope was installed at his new Flagstaff, Arizona observatory.",1,10,== Life and career == | === Venus spokes ===,24033
Lowell observed the planet high in the daytime sky with the telescope's lens stopped down to 3 inches in diameter to reduce the effect of the turbulent daytime atmosphere.,2,10,== Life and career == | === Venus spokes ===,24033
"Lowell observed spoke-like surface features including a central dark spot, contrary to what was suspected then (and known now): that Venus has no surface features visible from Earth, being covered in an atmosphere that is opaque.",3,10,== Life and career == | === Venus spokes ===,24033
"It has been noted in a 2003 Journal for the History of Astronomy paper and in an article published in Sky and Telescope in July 2003 that Lowell's stopping down of the telescope created such a small exit pupil at the eyepiece, it may have become a giant ophthalmoscope giving Lowell an image of the shadows of blood vessels cast on the retina of his own eye.",4,10,== Life and career == | === Venus spokes ===,24033

"Lowell's greatest contribution to planetary studies came during the last decade of his life, which he devoted to the search for Planet X, a hypothetical planet beyond Neptune.",0,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
Lowell believed that the planets Uranus and Neptune were displaced from their predicted positions by the gravity of the unseen Planet X. Lowell started a search program in 1906.,1,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"A team of human computers, led by Elizabeth Williams were employed to calculate predicted regions for the proposed planet.",2,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
The program initially used a camera 5 inches (13 cm) in aperture.,3,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
The small field of view of the 42-inch (110 cm) reflecting telescope rendered the instrument impractical for searching.,4,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"From 1914 to 1916, a 9-inch (23 cm) telescope on loan from Sproul Observatory was used to search for Planet X.  Lowell did not discover Pluto but later Lowell Observatory (observatory code 690) would photograph Pluto in March and April 1915, without realizing at the time that it was not a star.",5,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"In 1930, Clyde Tombaugh, working at the Lowell Observatory, discovered Pluto near the location expected for Planet X. Partly in recognition of Lowell's efforts, a stylized P-L monogram (♇) – the first two letters of the new planet's name and also Lowell's initials – was chosen as Pluto's astronomical symbol.",6,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"However, it would subsequently emerge that the Planet X theory was mistaken.",7,12,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"Pluto's mass could not be determined until 1978, when its satellite Charon was discovered.",0,13,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"This confirmed what had been increasingly suspected: Pluto's gravitational influence on Uranus and Neptune is negligible, certainly not nearly enough to account for the discrepancies in their orbits.",1,13,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union.",2,13,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"In addition, it is now known that the discrepancies between the predicted and observed positions of Uranus and Neptune were not caused by the gravity of an unknown planet.",0,14,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"Rather, they were due to an erroneous value for the mass of Neptune.",1,14,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033
"Voyager 2's 1989 encounter with Neptune yielded a more accurate value of its mass, and the discrepancies disappear when using this value.",2,14,== Life and career == | === Pluto ===,24033

"Although Lowell's theories of the Martian canals, of surface features on Venus, and of Planet X are now discredited, his practice of building observatories at the position where they would best function has been adopted as a principle.",0,16,== Legacy ==,24033
He also established the program and setting which made the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh possible.,1,16,== Legacy ==,24033
"Lowell has been described by other planetary scientists as ""the most influential popularizer of planetary science in America before Carl Sagan"".",2,16,== Legacy ==,24033
"While eventually disproved, Lowell's vision of the Martian canals, as an artifact of an ancient civilization making a desperate last effort to survive, significantly influences the development of science fiction – starting with H. G. Wells' influential The War of the Worlds, which made the further logical inference that creatures from a dying planet might seek to invade Earth.",3,16,== Legacy ==,24033
"The image of the dying Mars and its ancient culture was retained, in numerous versions and variations, in most science fiction works depicting Mars in the first half of the twentieth century (see Mars in fiction).",0,17,== Legacy ==,24033
"Even when proven to be factually mistaken, the vision of Mars derived from his theories remains enshrined in works that remain in print and widely read as classics of science fiction.",1,17,== Legacy ==,24033
Lowell's influence on science fiction remains strong.,0,18,== Legacy ==,24033
The canals figure prominently in Red Planet by Robert A. Heinlein (1949) and The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury (1950).,1,18,== Legacy ==,24033
"The canals, and even Lowell's mausoleum, heavily influence The Gods of Mars (1918) by Edgar Rice Burroughs as well as all other books in the Barsoom series.",2,18,== Legacy ==,24033
"Asteroid 1886 Lowell, discovered by Henry Giclas and Robert Schaldach in 1949, as well as crater Lowell on the Moon, and crater Lowell on Mars, were named after him.",0,19,== Legacy ==,24033
