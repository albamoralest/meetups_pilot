"Four of these are complete: Erec and Enide (c. 1170); Cligès (c. 1176); Yvain, the Knight of the Lion; and Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, the latter two written simultaneously between 1177 and 1181.",1,4,== Works ==,170987
Yvain is generally considered Chrétien's most masterful work.,2,4,== Works ==,170987
"Chrétien's final romance was Perceval, the Story of the Grail, written between 1181 and 1190, but left unfinished, though some scholars have disputed this.",3,4,== Works ==,170987
"It is dedicated to Philip, Count of Flanders, to whom Chrétien may have been attached in his last years.",4,4,== Works ==,170987

"In the case of Perceval, one continuer says the poet's death prevented him from completing the work; in the case of Lancelot, no reason is given.",7,4,== Works ==,170987

"Two short-lyric chansons on the subject of love are also very likely his, but the attribution of the pious romance Guillaume d'Angleterre to him is now widely doubted.",2,5,== Works ==,170987
"It has also been suggested that Chrétien might be the author of two short verse romances titled Le Chevalier à l'épée and La Mule sans frein, but this theory has not found much support.",3,5,== Works ==,170987
"Chrétien names his treatments of Ovid in the introduction to Cligès, where he also mentions his work about King Mark and Iseult.",4,5,== Works ==,170987
"The latter is presumably related to the legend of Tristan and Iseult, though Tristan is not named.",5,5,== Works ==,170987
"Chrétien's take on Tristan has not survived, though in the introduction of Cligès, Chrétien himself says that his treatment of Tristan was not well received, possibly explaining why it does not survive.",6,5,== Works ==,170987

"Geoffrey of Monmouth or Wace might have supplied some of the names, but neither author mentioned Erec, Lancelot, Gornemant and many others who play an important role in Chrétien's narratives.",1,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"One is left to guess about Latin or French literary originals which are now lost, or upon continental lore that goes back to a Celtic source in the case of Béroul, an Anglo-Norman who wrote around 1150.",2,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"For his Perceval, the Story of the Grail, the influence of the story is clearly tied to the story of Saint Galgano (Galgano Guidotti) who died in 1180–1181 and was canonized in 1185: a knight struck by god's vision, planted his sword in the ground that immediately solidified (kept in Abbey San Galgano).",3,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"However, Chrétien found his sources immediately at hand, without much understanding of its primitive spirit, but appreciating it as a setting for the ideal society dreamed of, although not realized, in his own day.",4,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
And Chrétien's five romances together form the most complete expression from a single author of the ideals of French chivalry.,5,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"Though so far there has been little critical attention paid to the subject, it is not inaccurate to say that Chrétien was influenced by the changing face of secular and canonical law in the 12th century.",6,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"This is particularly relevant for his Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, which makes repeated use of the customary law prevalent in Chrétien's day.",7,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"William Wistar Comfort praised de Troyes' ""significance as a literary artist and as the founder of a precious literary tradition [which] distinguishes him from all other poets of the Latin races between the close of the Empire and the arrival of Dante.""",8,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987

"Three of Middle High German literature's finest examples, Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and Hartmann von Aue's Erec and Iwein, were based on Perceval, Erec, and Yvain; the Three Welsh Romances associated with the Mabinogion (Peredur, son of Efrawg, Geraint and Enid, and Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain) are derived from the same trio.",10,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"Especially in the case of Peredur, however, the connection between the Welsh romances and their source is probably not direct and has never been satisfactorily delineated.",11,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"Chrétien also has the distinction of being the first writer to mention the Holy Grail (Perceval), Camelot (Lancelot), and the love affair between Queen Guinevere and Lancelot (Lancelot), subjects of household recognition even today.",12,7,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"There is a specific Classical influence in Chrétien's romances, the likes of which (the Iliad, the Aeneid, the Metamorphoses) were ""translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s"".",0,8,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"Foster Guyer argues that specifically Yvain, the Knight of the Lion contains definite Ovidian influence: ""Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak.",1,8,== Sources and influence ==,170987

"A ""story"" could be anything from a single battle scene, to a prologue, to a minimally cohesive tale with little to no chronological layout.",6,8,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"Uitti argues that Yvain is Chrétien's ""most carefully contrived romance…",7,8,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"It has a beginning, a middle, and an end: we are in no doubt that Yvain's story is over.""",8,8,== Sources and influence ==,170987
"This very method of having three definite parts, including the build in the middle leading to the climax of the story, is in large part why Chrétien is seen to be a writer of novels five centuries before novels, as we know them, existed.",9,8,== Sources and influence ==,170987
