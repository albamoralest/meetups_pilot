"In a statement dated May 9, 2005, and posted on its website, the United Keetoowah Band said: ""The United Keetoowah Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill IS not a member of the Keetoowah Band and was only given an honorary 'associate membership' in the early 1990s because he could not prove any Cherokee ancestry"".",2,32,== Personal life == | === Genealogy ===,4091662

"In June 2005, the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill's genealogy and family history.",10,32,== Personal life == | === Genealogy ===,4091662
"The newspaper's research ""turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor"" among 142 direct ancestors [of Churchill's] identified from records.",11,32,== Personal life == | === Genealogy ===,4091662

The News found that some of Churchill's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records.,13,32,== Personal life == | === Genealogy ===,4091662

"Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his asserted Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements.",0,34,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency.,1,34,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
"In 1995, Churchill discussed his views on the blood quantum with David Barsamian in an interview:",2,34,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in Ibero-America.,0,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
"But in Anglo-America, while there was some preoccupation with it, it was not formalized until the passage of the General Allotment Act, mid-1880s.",1,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one-quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group.,2,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
You couldn't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian.,3,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter.,4,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
The reason for this was quite clear.,5,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
They were identifying Indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point.,6,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
"If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such, then the rest of the land would be declared surplus.",7,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available.,8,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to Indianness in the first place.,9,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
It's become increasingly so ever since.,10,35,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
"For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose.",0,36,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
He says:,1,36,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
"Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence.",0,37,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below).,0,38,== Personal life == | === Blood quantum ===,4091662
