"In his search for a more intense rhythmic experience, Dalcroze posed some questions.",0,6,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"First, he questioned why music theory and notation were taught as abstractions, dissociated from sound, movements, and feelings that they represented.",1,6,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"Moreover, by taking the pianist as an example, he asked how the finger technique taught by professors could be considered a complete musical education.",2,6,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"Finally, he was intrigued that the qualities that characterize a real musician were rarely experienced in a music class.",3,6,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
Dalcroze believed the first instrument that must be trained in music is the body.,0,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"He developed techniques that combined hearing with a physical response, transferring to a physical response in singing and reading music.",1,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"He did many experiments with his students, used to help in the process of learning and feeling music.",2,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"His main goal was to develop the inner ear to facilitate musical thinking, reading, and writing music without the help of an instrument.",3,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"While continuing to build his methodology, he observed his students and noticed that the students who could not play in time in the music world, were able to walk in time in the real world.",4,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
The walking was completely spontaneous and easy.,5,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"He observed that some of his best students could tap the beat using their feet, or shake their heads and bodies in response to music.",6,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
This physical response was natural and common to all ages and cultures.,7,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"Moreover, he noticed that students would change their movements when following a crescendo, and would respond physically to the accents of the music.",8,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
They also relaxed their muscles with the endings of phrases.,9,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386
"As they seemed to hear the music, feeling its effects, he concluded that the students themselves were the instruments, not the piano.",10,7,== Educational philosophy ==,2763386

Dalcroze noticed that students had a mechanical understanding instead of a musical comprehension.,0,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"They were not able to hear harmonies that they wrote in the music theory classes, and they could not create simple melodies and chord sequences.",1,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
This resulted in a lack of musical sensitivity that caused problems in the performance.,2,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"His aim was to find ways to help students to develop skills to feel, hear, create, imagine, connect, memorize, read, and write, as well as perform and interpret music.",3,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"He worked in order to free his students from the conflicts between mind and body, feeling and expression.",4,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
Dalcroze realized that the aspects of music that are more connected to the senses are rhythm and movement.,5,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"Regarding the three elements of music, pitch, rhythm, and dynamic, he recognized that the last two were entirely dependent on movement.",6,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
He also found their best models in the muscular system.,7,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"For him, all degrees of time (tempi) can be experienced, understood, and expressed through the body.",8,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
He felt that the enthusiasm of musical feelings depended on the sharpness of physical sensations.,9,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
He was convinced that the combination of intense listening and the responses of the body would generate and release a powerful musical force.,10,9,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
Dalcroze needed a laboratory to test his theories.,0,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"By working with students, he decided to hire his own workspace.",1,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"He started to look for principles, teaching strategies, teaching styles, and methods that could convert music into a practical educational tool.",2,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"The principles and methods which he developed were unique and new, so he gave them a special name: eurhythmics.",3,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"In the beginning, Dalcroze thought that the solution to many problems would be teaching musicians to contract and relax in a specific time (the speed of sound or time), in a specific space (the duration of a sound), and with a particular force (energy dynamics of a sound).",4,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"Thus, he worked on a new series of exercises designed to help students strengthen their perception by the metric and its instincts by many streams of the movement, called rhythm.",5,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"Then, he began to propose exercises by playing music and suggesting that students walk as they would feel the pulse.",6,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"Surprisingly, students acted differently and had difficulties in different tempos.",7,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"Therefore, he deduced that people still had trouble reaching the goal of speed, accuracy, and performance by being rhythmically expressive.",8,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
"He realized that there could be some system of quick communication between the brain, which understands and analyzes, and the muscles that perform.",9,10,== Dalcroze eurhythmics ==,2763386
