"The New Grove (article by James Webster) asserts that the ""Count Morzin"" who played an important role in Haydn's life was Karl Joseph Franz Morzin (1717–1783), whereas a biography by the leading Haydn scholar H. C. Robbins Landon asserts that it was Ferdinand Maximilan Franz Morzin' (1693–1763).",1,2,== Biography ==,10951542
The difference apparently involves the question of whether Haydn was hired by the reigning count (Ferdinand Maximilian) or his son (Karl Joseph); see External Link below.,2,2,== Biography ==,10951542

The date of Haydn's appointment is also uncertain; it was in 1757.,0,4,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542

"""Haydn wrote, approximately, his first fifteen symphonies for Count Morzin.",7,5,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542
"Evidence from copied parts made for Baron Karl Joseph Weber von Fürnberg (an earlier Haydn employer) leads Robbins Landon to conjecture that the Count's orchestra consisted of ""at least six, possibly eight violins ... while in the basso section there were at least one cello, one bassoon and one double bass (violone).",8,5,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542
"There was also a wind-band sextet (oboes, bassoons, and horns)."".",9,5,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542

"While in Vienna, the Morzin ensemble was evidently part of a lively musical scene, sponsored by the aristocracy.",0,6,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542
"Haydn's contemporary biographer Giuseppe Carpani (whose testimony is not always trusted by musicologists) wrote the following concerning Count Harrach, who was the patron of Haydn's own birth village of Rohrau:",1,6,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542

He dismissed his musicians and so Haydn lost his post as Kapellmeister.,2,9,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542
"Meanwhile Haydn had the great recommendation of a public reputation; his amiable character was known; Count Morzin was moved to be useful on his behalf--three circumstances that combined so fortunately that Haydn soon after he ceased to be Kapellmeister to Count Morzin (1760) was taken on as Vicekapellmeister ... in the service of Prince Anton Esterházy ... at Eisenstadt, with a salary of 400 florins.",3,9,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542
"In fact, since Haydn was Kapellmeister at Eisenstadt in all but name, the incumbent Kapellmeister being infirm, the move to the Esterházy family was a big career advance for him, and he continued there in the same general line of work, as composer, conductor, and administrator, but working for a far wealthier family.",4,9,== Joseph Haydn ==,10951542
