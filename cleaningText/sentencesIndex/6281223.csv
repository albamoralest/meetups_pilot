"In a series of articles collected as The Critique of Digital Capitalism, Betancourt criticized what he called the ""immaterialism"" of digital technology, specifically the claims that digital technology ends scarcity through being able to create value without expenditure, unlike the reality of limited resources, time, and expenses; it is based on denying the actual costs of access, creation, production, and maintenance of computer networks and technologies.",0,19,== The digital ==,6281223

"In ""Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism,"" Betancourt proposed that the illusion of a rupture between physical and virtual production posed by the aura of the digital can be observed in the political economy of the United States, most especially in the Housing Bubble that burst in 2008.",0,23,== The digital == | === Digital capitalism ===,6281223
"His analysis states that ""Financial 'bubbles' are an inevitable result of a systemic shift focused on the generation of value through the semiotic exchange and transfer of immaterial assets.""",1,23,== The digital == | === Digital capitalism ===,6281223

Automation is a recurring theme in Betancourt's discussion of digital technology and capitalism.,0,26,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
"In his discussion of the New Aesthetic, he argued that the transformations of production being created by computers and automated assembly lines belong to a larger shift in the digital capitalist economy:",1,26,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
"The various artifacts brought together as the 'new aesthetic' are united by their orientation not towards human observation or functional utility, but rather by their invocation of productive values without human action -- the aura of the digital's separation of product from all that is required to produce it: labor, capital, resources.",0,27,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
"This transition point marks a shift from the fragmentation of the assembly-line where tasks are organized around the repetitive action of masses of human labor (itself an organization that implies semiotic disassembly and standardization) to an automated fabrication where the design is generated on digital machines and then implemented by other digital machines without human labor in the fracture process; the necessity of human-as-designer thus comes into question as it is the only aspect of non-machine agency remaining, an element whose necessity is challenged by evolutionary algorithms and automated design.",1,27,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
The replacement of human labor by automation poses a problem for capitalism according to Betancourt because capitalism is dependent on the exchange of labor for wages that are then spent purchasing the production of that labor.,0,28,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
"The elimination of labor by automation follows what Betancourt has called a fundamental law of the ideology of automation: ""Anything that can be automated, will be.""",1,28,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
"Following the automation of physical production, the transformation of formerly intellectual labor by ""autonomous production that began as a ""labor-saving"" procedure now saves all human labor in/as the productive machine: it is this specific dimension of automated (immaterial) labor using digital technology that reflects an ideology of production-without-consumption.""",0,29,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
The elimination of labor by automated labor presents a paradox for Betancourt's digital capitalism because the wages paid to workers for their labor are the basic element around which all of capitalism is built.,1,29,== The digital == | === Automated labor ===,6281223
