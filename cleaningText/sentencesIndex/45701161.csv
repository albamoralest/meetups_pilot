"This effect was achieved by cutting two parallel concentric grooves on each side of the disc instead of the usual one, and pressing a different version of the song into each one – the result being that the single actually offered four detailed variations on the song, with a gramophone stylus likely to fit into and trace a different groove each time that the disc was played.",6,11,== Camilla's Little Secret (1992–1994) ==,45701161

"In 1999, inspired in part by his ongoing work on reclaiming and remastering King Crimson's unreleased live recordings, Singleton (together with graphic designer Steve Ball) developed the idea of BootlegTV – an online music distribution service and video sharing website dedicated to archived live concerts.",0,13,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161
"BootlegTV was originally envisaged as ""(a way) to use the web to enable distribution of live music in a way that would undermine the illegal bootleg market while giving musicians an opportunity to manage and monetize a previously difficult-to-distribute asset that (was) gathering dust in their closet: their live concert recordings.""",1,13,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161

Other bands who signed up to the roster included The Tragically Hip.,9,14,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161
"Other ideas considered for development by the company included investigations into a standalone form of ""non-linear music"" and the provision of a video connection between artists and audience to allow the latter to follow the former's day-to-day developing work.",10,14,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161
"Despite raising four million dollars in initial investment, BootlegTV folded in 2001, due a reluctance on the part of investors to continue supporting the original business plan.",11,14,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161
"Fripp would later reflect that the concept had arrived too early and would have required broadband technology (which, at the time, was not widely available) to succeed.",12,14,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161
"For several years, BootlegTV continued as a technology company called Bootleg Networks (championing the development of broadband and building tools to allow other companies to catalogue and stream their video archive content) although Singleton's involvement would be reduced.",13,14,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161
"Although initially unsuccessful, BootlegTV's ideas anticipated later video sharing websites and digitally distributed audio-visual musician initiatives including YouTube, Live Phish Downloads and Pearl Jam Live.",14,14,== BootlegTV (1999–2001) ==,45701161

"Initially a pseudonym for Singleton's diary on the DGM website, the persona developed into a multimedia project which incorporated satirical ""whodunit"" novels set in the music industry, a graphic novel, videoblogs and Singleton's own songwriting career.",1,16,== The Vicar (2001–present) ==,45701161
"From 2001, several incidents of Singleton's production work on King Crimson or Robert Fripp releases were credited to the Vicar, and Singleton also used the persona as a production alias for the 2005 School Aid single 'Where's the Money, Mr Blair?'",0,17,== The Vicar (2001–present) ==,45701161
"From 2003 onwards, Singleton's mystery stories about the Vicar (incorporating and narrated by the Vicar's alleged assistant Punk Sanderson) were published as instalments on the Vicar's diary page; from 2007 onwards, the stories were reposted as a video blog presented and narrated by Punk.",1,17,== The Vicar (2001–present) ==,45701161
"Various publicity stunts and culture-jamming incidents followed, ostensibly carried out by Punk: these included a period of incarceration within Facebook, 2013’s ""Fart For Your Rights"" campaign (a mock dirty protest aimed at Universal Music Group, who were at the time selling King Crimson's music without a proper legal agreement or due remuneration) and a 2014 iTunes app of drummer jokes.",2,17,== The Vicar (2001–present) ==,45701161
