"A strong-willed, hands-on president, Wegeforth walked the Zoo grounds daily and had a singular vision for its future, with little room for opposing viewpoints.",5,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Philanthropist Ellen Browning Scripps, who had made several significant donations to the Zoo, suggested that it needed a full-time director and volunteered to pay such a person's salary for three years if Wegeforth could find someone suitable for the job.",6,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184

"Buck himself soon arrived with the rest of the promised Asian animals, including two orangutans, a leopard cub, two gray langurs, two kangaroos, three flamingos, two lion-tailed macaques, two sarus cranes, four demoiselle cranes, assorted geese, and a 23-foot reticulated python named ""Diablo"" that became famous when it would not eat and had to be regularly force-fed by a team of men using a feeding tube attached to a meat grinder, a spectacle that attracted thousands of onlookers and became a paid event until the snake's death in 1928.",13,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Buck began his directorship of the San Diego Zoo on June 13, 1923, signed to a three-year contract at an annual salary of $4,000 (equivalent to about $55,500 in 2015).",14,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"He was enthusiastic at first, telling reporters ""We have the best zoo west of Chicago, and we are going to make it even bigger and better.""",15,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"However, Buck, a self-made, solitary, rugged, and independent-minded individual, soon clashed with the board of directors, particularly Wegeforth.",16,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Members of the board complained that Buck was unwilling to consult with them on everyday policy and frequently defied their directives; he constructed new cassowary cages of his own design in direct defiance of their orders, they said, and had bragged to board member William Raymenton about ""putting one over on the board by constructing the cage without their knowledge"", boasting that he would continue to build whatever cages he considered proper ""with or without the consent of the board.""",17,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"He had also been instructed to build an enclosure for a zebu that had been allowed to wander the Zoo grounds, but apparently ignored the directive.",18,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"According to Wegeforth, Buck made business deals with other zoos and animal collectors that were mismanaged or undocumented, and ordered expensive custom nameplates for the Zoo's animals and exhibits which had to be returned when it was found that Buck had misspelled half of the names.",19,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Prior to receiving Empress and Queenie, Wegeforth had struck a deal with John Ringling to acquire elephants from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus; when Ringling telegraphed that the circus was returning to San Diego and he was bringing the promised elephants, Wegeforth recorded that ""without consulting me, [Buck] wired back declining the elephants and asking for other animals instead!",20,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
I was dumbfounded when I learned about this on the circus' arrival—hardly adequate thanks for Mr. Ringling's trouble in transporting them across the continent for us.,21,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Of course, they did not carry a side line of animals around with them like spare tires but they did give us a tiger, a zebra, and a camel.",22,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"""The final straw involved an incident with Empress and Queenie: Buck believed that their hides appeared dry and cracked and would benefit from ""oiling"", an old practice in zoos and circuses in which elephants were covered in neatsfoot oil to soften and condition their skin, the oil being washed off after a few days.",23,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Wegeforth, a physician, took a strong interest in veterinary medicine and personally monitored the health of the animals, and had learned that oiling could cause pneumonia or Bright's disease in elephants.",24,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
He therefore ordered Buck never to oil Empress and Queenie.,25,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Buck oiled them anyway, and according to Wegeforth ""they became very piteous-looking creatures, their trunks grew flaccid and seemed about a foot longer than usual, and their abdomens almost touched the ground.",26,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
I was afraid they were doomed.,27,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"We mixed Epsom salts with bran and, by using alfalfa meal, at last caused their bowels to move and relieved them of much of the edema.",28,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Some time passed before they were able to use their trunks but eventually they were as well as ever.""",29,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Returning from a trip to San Francisco a few months later, Wegeforth found that Buck had oiled the elephants a second time.",30,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"They recovered again, but Buck was immediately fired and left San Diego after only three months as director of the Zoo, the board of directors charging that he ""couldn't be trusted"".",31,7,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Buck promptly sued the board of directors for breach of contract, saying he had given up his lucrative animal collecting business to work in San Diego and had suffered damage to his reputation.",0,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"He sought $12,500 in salary which he would have received in his three-year contract, as well as $10,000 in damages (a total equivalent to about $312,285 in 2015).",1,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"He also sued Wegeforth personally, and when the matter went to court in February 1924 Buck accused Wegeforth of interfering with ""practically everything"" related to his job, and of conspiring with the board to ""belittle and disparage"" his efforts as director.",2,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Wegeforth accused Buck of incompetence and testified that ""the whole character of the man was insubordination.""",3,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Buck also claimed that Wegeforth had killed a sick tiger by dosing the animal with calomel, and that the doctor's experiments in force-feeding snakes with a sausage stuffer had resulted in the deaths of 150 of the reptiles.",4,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Wegeforth had in fact administered calomel tablets to a tiger suffering an intestinal ailment in August 1923, and in his memoirs described experimenting with methods of force-feeding Diablo the python before coming up with the idea to tube-feed the snake using a sausage stuffer.",5,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Board member Thomas Faulconer and other witnesses, however, suggested that the sick tiger had died after a suspicious blow to the head, and flatly denied the snake-killing accusation.",6,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"Wegeforth claimed that Buck himself had mistreated the reptiles, saying that he had ""stuffed down, by the most inhuman way of feeding, snake meat down the throat of a boa constrictor instead of using a more modern method of stomach tube or feeding the meat through a tube.""",7,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"On February 20, 1924, superior court judge Charles Andrews ruled against Buck and ordered him to pay court costs of $24 (equivalent to about $333 in 2015).",8,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"In his 1941 autobiography All in a Lifetime, Buck did not mention his clashes with the Zoological Society board, his firing, or the subsequent lawsuit.",9,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"He did, however, claim that ""while acting as temporary director of the San Diego Zoo"", he had invented a method of force-feeding snakes, the means ""by which captive pythons are mainly fed today.""",10,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"He made one subsequent contribution to the Zoo, though indirectly: Having returned to his animal-collecting career, in 1925 he brought a shipment of animals to San Diego including a salmon-crested cockatoo named ""King Tut"" from the Maluku Islands.",11,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"The bird was sold to a La Mesa, California couple who shared it with the Zoo.",12,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
"King Tut went on to appear in several films, television shows, and theater productions, and was the ""official greeter"" of the Zoo for decades, sitting on a perch inside the entrance to squawk at guests Following King Tut's death in 1990, a bronze statue of the cockatoo was placed in the location of its longtime perch and remains there today, its plaque indicating that the bird ""was brought from Indonesia in 1925 by Frank Buck"".",13,8,== Director of the San Diego Zoo ==,5851184
