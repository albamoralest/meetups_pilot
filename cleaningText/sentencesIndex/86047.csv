Music ==,1,6,== Music ==,86047
"For listeners unfamiliar with experimental music, Bailey's distinctive style can be challenging.",0,7,== Music ==,86047
"Its most noticeable feature is its extreme discontinuity, often from note to note.",1,7,== Music ==,86047
"There may be enormous intervals between consecutive notes, and rather than aspiring to the consistency of timbre typical of most guitar-playing, Bailey interrupts it as much as possible.",2,7,== Music ==,86047
"Four consecutive notes, for instance, may be played on an open string, a fretted string, via harmonics, and using a nonstandard technique such as scraping the string with the pick or plucking below the bridge.",3,7,== Music ==,86047
"Playing both acoustic and electric guitars (although more usually the latter), Bailey extended the possibilities of the instrument in radical ways, obtaining wider array of sounds than are usually heard.",0,8,== Music ==,86047
"He explored the full vocabulary of the instrument, producing timbres and tones ranging from the most delicate tinklings to fierce noise attacks.",1,8,== Music ==,86047
(The sounds he produced have been compared to those made by John Cage's prepared piano.),2,8,== Music ==,86047
"Typically, he played a conventional instrument, in standard tuning, but his use of amplification was often crucial.",3,8,== Music ==,86047
"In the 1970 his standard set-up involved two independently controlled amplifiers to give a stereo effect onstage, and he often would use the swell pedal to counteract the normal attack and decay of notes.",4,8,== Music ==,86047
"He made original use of feedback, a technique demonstrated on the album String Theory (Paratactile, 2000).",5,8,== Music ==,86047
Throughout both his commercial and improvising careers his principal guitar was a 1963 Gibson ES 175 model.,6,8,== Music ==,86047
"Although Bailey occasionally made use of prepared guitar in the 1970s (he would, for example, put paper clips on the strings, wrap his instruments in chains, or add further strings to the guitar), often for Dadaist/theatrical effect, by the end of that decade he had, in his own words, ""dumped"" such methods.",7,8,== Music ==,86047
"Bailey argued that his approach to music-making was actually far more orthodox than performers such as Keith Rowe of the improvising collective AMM, who treats the guitar purely as a ""sound source"" rather than as a musical instrument.",8,8,== Music ==,86047
"Instead, Bailey preferred to ""look for whatever 'effects' I might need through technique"".",9,8,== Music ==,86047
"Eschewing labels such as ""jazz"" and ""free jazz"", Bailey described his music as ""non-idiomatic"".",10,8,== Music ==,86047
"In the second edition of his book Improvisation..., Bailey indicated that he felt that free improvisation was no longer ""non-idiomatic"" in his sense of the word, as it had become a recognizable genre and musical style itself.",11,8,== Music ==,86047
"Bailey frequently sought performance contexts that would provide new stimulations and challenge that would prove musically ""interesting"", as he often put it.",12,8,== Music ==,86047
"This led to work with collaborators such as Pat Metheny, John Zorn, Lee Konitz, David Sylvian, Cyro Baptista, Cecil Taylor, Keiji Haino, tap dancer Will Gaines, Drum 'n' Bass DJ Ninj, Susie Ibarra, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and the Japanese noise rock group Ruins.",13,8,== Music ==,86047
"Despite often performing and recording in a solo context, he was far more interested in the dynamics and challenges of working with other musicians, especially those who did not necessarily share his approach.",14,8,== Music ==,86047
As he put it in a March 2002 article of Jazziz magazine:,15,8,== Music ==,86047
"There has to be some degree, not just of unfamiliarity, but incompatibility [with a partner].",0,9,== Music ==,86047
"Otherwise, what are you improvising for?",1,9,== Music ==,86047
What are you improvising with or around?,2,9,== Music ==,86047
You've got to find somewhere where you can work.,3,9,== Music ==,86047
"If there are no difficulties, it seems to me that there's pretty much no point in playing.",4,9,== Music ==,86047
I find that the things that excite me are trying to make something work.,5,9,== Music ==,86047
"And when it does work, it's the most fantastic thing.",6,9,== Music ==,86047
"Maybe the most obvious analogy would be the grit that produces the pearl in an oyster, or some shit like that.",7,9,== Music ==,86047
Bailey was also known for his dry sense of humour.,0,10,== Music ==,86047
"In 1977, Musics magazine sent the question ""What happens to time-awareness during improvisation?"" to about thirty musicians associated with the free improvisation scene.",1,10,== Music ==,86047
"The answers received answers that varied from long, and theoretical essays to plain, direct comments.",2,10,== Music ==,86047
"Typically pithy was Bailey's reply: ""The ticks turn into tocks and the tocks turn into ticks.",3,10,== Music ==,86047
"""Mirakle, a 1999 recording released in 2000, shows Bailey moving into the free funk genre, performing with bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma and drummer Grant Calvin Weston.",4,10,== Music ==,86047
"Carpal Tunnel, the last album to be released during his lifetime, documented his struggle with the carpal tunnel syndrome in his right hand which had rendered him unable to grip a plectrum.",5,10,== Music ==,86047
This problem marked the onset of Lou Gehrig's disease.,6,10,== Music ==,86047
"Characteristically, he refused invasive surgery to treat his condition, instead being more ""interested in finding ways to work around"" this limitation.",7,10,== Music ==,86047
"He chose to ""relearn"" guitar playing techniques by utilising his right thumb and index fingers to pluck the strings.",8,10,== Music ==,86047
