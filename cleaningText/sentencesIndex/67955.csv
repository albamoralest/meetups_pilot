"After Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet.",0,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"Even Carmen was altered into grand opera format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score.",1,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from Carmen and the L'Arlésienne suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death.",2,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"However, the 20th century saw increased interest.",3,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"Don Procopio was revived in Monte Carlo in 1906; an Italian version of Les pêcheurs de perles was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York on 13 November 1916, with Caruso in the leading tenor role, and it has since become a staple at many opera houses.",4,42,== Legacy ==,67955

"Vasco da Gama and Ivan IV have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music.",7,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"Carmen, after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878).",8,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"It has been hailed as the first opera of the verismo school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting life—""not idealised life but life as actually lived"".",9,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"The music critic Harold C. Schonberg surmises that, had Bizet lived, he might have revolutionised French opera; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably Puccini who, according to Dean, developed the idea ""till it became threadbare"".",10,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names Chabrier and Ravel as composers influenced by him.",11,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes—Frédéri in L'Arlésienne, José in Carmen—is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the B minor ""Pathetique"".",12,42,== Legacy ==,67955
Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy is limited by the shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years.,13,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"""The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no one asked him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable.",14,42,== Legacy ==,67955

"In 1886, Geneviève married Émile Straus, a rich lawyer; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of, among others, Marcel Proust.",19,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"She showed little interest in her first husband's musical legacy, made no effort to catalogue Bizet's manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs.",20,42,== Legacy ==,67955
"She died in 1926; in her will, she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize, to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had ""produced a remarkable work within the previous five years"".",21,42,== Legacy ==,67955
