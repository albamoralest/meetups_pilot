"For the Chorus album in 1991, he gathered together his collection of analogue synthesisers from various recording studio locations in London and set up a small studio in Amsterdam.",0,41,== Production and recording methods ==,207103
This led Clarke to assemble an intricate patch system to more easily enable the control of his analogue instruments:,1,41,== Production and recording methods ==,207103
"""... the secret is having a good patch system – not as in patching to the mixing desk, but in patching CV and Gate.",0,42,== Production and recording methods ==,207103

"Once we've worked out a song, I start programming up the arrangement on the BBC UMI sequencer, which lets me run 16 synths simultaneously.",6,44,== Production and recording methods ==,207103

"And finally the whole lot is transferred to my Roland MC4, piece by piece, so it's being run in CV and Gate.",9,44,== Production and recording methods ==,207103
