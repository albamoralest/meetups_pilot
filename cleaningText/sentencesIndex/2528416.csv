The 3-2/2-3 clave concept and terminology was developed in New York City during the 1940s by Bauza while he was the music director of Machito and his Afro-Cubans.,0,14,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
Bauzá was a master at moving the song from one side of clave to the other.,1,14,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
The following melodic excerpt is taken from the opening verses of “Que vengan los rumberos” by Machito and his Afro-Cubans.,2,14,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
Notice how the melody goes from one side of clave to the other and then back again.,3,14,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"A measure of 2/4 moves the chord progression from the two-side (2–3), to the three-side (3–2).",4,14,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"Later, another measure of 2/4 moves the start of the chord progression back to two-side (2–3).",5,14,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
The first 4 1⁄2 claves of the verses are in 2–3.,0,15,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
Following the measure of 2/4 (half clave) the song flips to the three-side.,1,15,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
It continues in 3-2 on the V7 chord for 4 1⁄2 claves.,2,15,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
The second measure of 2/4 flips the song back to the two-side and the I chord.,3,15,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"In songs like “Que vengan los rumberos,” the phrases continually alternate between a 3–2 framework and a 2–3 framework.",0,16,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
It takes a certain amount of flexibility to repeatedly reorder your orientation in this way.,1,16,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
The most challenging moments are the truncations and other transitional phrases where you “pivot” in order to move your point of reference from one side of clave to the other.,2,16,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"Working in conjunction with the chord and clave changes, vocalist Frank “Machito” Grillo creates an arc of tension/release spanning more than a dozen measures.",0,17,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"Initially Machito sings the melody straight (first line), but soon expresses the lyrics in the freer and more syncopated inspiración of a folkloric rumba (second line).",1,17,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"By the time the song changes to 3–2 on the V7 chord, Machito has developed a considerable amount of rhythmic tension by contradicting the underlying meter.",2,17,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"That tension is then resolved when he sings on three consecutive main beats (quarter-notes), followed by tresillo.",3,17,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
In the measure immediately following tresillo the song returns to 2–3 and the I chord (fifth line)—Peñalosa (2010).,4,17,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"Bobby Sanabria, who was Bauzá's drummer during his later years, points out that Bauzá was the first to explore jazz arranging techniques with authentic Afro-Cuban rhythms on a consistent basis giving, it a unique identifiable sound that no other band in the genre of Afro-Cuban-based dance music had at the time.",0,18,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
"Cuban big band arranger Chico O'Farill stated: ""This was a new concept in interpreting Cuban music with as much (harmonic) richness as possible.",1,18,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
You have to understand how important this was.,2,18,== Master of arranging in-clave ==,2528416
