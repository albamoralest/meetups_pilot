Arabic (also Arabist or Hispano-Arabic)The sixteenth century Italian historian Giammaria Barbieri was perhaps the first to suggest Arabian influences on the music of the troubadours.,0,14,== Origins ==,63788
"Later scholars like J.B. Trend have asserted that the poetry of troubadours is connected to Arabic poetry written in the Iberian Peninsula, while others have attempted to find direct evidence of this influence.",1,14,== Origins ==,63788
"In examining the works of William IX of Aquitaine, Évariste Lévi-Provençal and other scholars found three lines that they believed were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works.",2,14,== Origins ==,63788
"The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question, though the medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.",3,14,== Origins ==,63788
"Scholars like Ramón Menéndez Pidal stated that the troubadour tradition was created by William, who had been influenced by Moorish music and poetry while fighting with the Reconquista.",4,14,== Origins ==,63788
"However, George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in the Iberian Peninsula, and it occurred towards the end of his life.",5,14,== Origins ==,63788
"Beech adds that while the sources of William's inspirations are uncertain, he and his father did have individuals within their extended family with Iberian origins, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the Arabic language.",6,14,== Origins ==,63788
"Regardless of William's personal involvement in the tradition's creation, Magda Bogin states that Arab poetry was likely one of several influences on European ""courtly love poetry"", citing Ibn Hazm's ""The Ring of the Dove"" as an example of a similar Arab tradition.",7,14,== Origins ==,63788
"Methods of transmission from Arab Iberia to the rest of Europe did exist, such as the Toledo School of Translators, though it only began translating major romances from Arabic into Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century, with objectionable sexual content removed in deference to the Catholic Church.",8,14,== Origins ==,63788
"Bernardine-Marianist or ChristianAccording to this theory, it was the theology espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux and the increasingly important Mariology that most strongly influenced the development of the troubadour genre.",0,15,== Origins ==,63788
"Specifically, the emphasis on religious and spiritual love, disinterestedness, mysticism, and devotion to Mary explained ""courtly love"".",1,15,== Origins ==,63788
"The emphasis of the reforming Robert of Arbrissel on ""matronage"" to achieve his ends can explain the troubadour attitude towards women.",2,15,== Origins ==,63788
"Chronologically, however, this hypothesis is hard to sustain (the forces believed to have given rise to the phenomenon arrived later than it).",3,15,== Origins ==,63788
But the influence of Bernardine and Marian theology can be retained without the origins theory.,4,15,== Origins ==,63788
This theory was advanced early by Eduard Wechssler and further by Dmitri Scheludko (who emphasises the Cluniac Reform) and Guido Errante.,5,15,== Origins ==,63788

"The existence of pre-Christian matriarchy has usually been treated with scepticism as has the persistence of underlying paganism in high medieval Europe, though the Celts and Germanic tribes were certainly less patriarchal than the Greco-Romans.",1,16,== Origins ==,63788
"Classical LatinThe classical Latin theory emphasises parallels between Ovid, especially his Amores and Ars amatoria, and the lyric of courtly love.",0,17,== Origins ==,63788
"The aetas ovidiana that predominated in the 11th century in and around Orléans, the quasi-Ciceronian ideology that held sway in the Imperial court, and the scraps of Plato then available to scholars have all been cited as classical influences on troubadour poetry.",1,17,== Origins ==,63788
"(Crypto-)CatharAccording to this thesis, troubadour poetry is a reflection of Cathar religious doctrine.",0,18,== Origins ==,63788
"While the theory is supported by the traditional and near-universal account of the decline of the troubadours coinciding with the suppression of Catharism during the Albigensian Crusade (first half of the 13th century), support for it has come in waves.",1,18,== Origins ==,63788
The explicitly Catholic meaning of many early troubadour works also works against the theory.,2,18,== Origins ==,63788
LiturgicalThe troubadour lyric may be a development of the Christian liturgy and hymnody.,0,19,== Origins ==,63788

There is no preceding Latin poetry resembling that of the troubadours.,2,19,== Origins ==,63788
"On those grounds, no theory of the latter's origins in classical or post-classical Latin can be constructed, but that has not deterred some, who believe that a pre-existing Latin corpus must merely be lost to us.",3,19,== Origins ==,63788
"That many troubadours received their grammatical training in Latin through the Church (from clerici, clerics) and that many were trained musically by the Church is well-attested.",4,19,== Origins ==,63788

Feudal-social or -sociologicalThis theory or set of related theories has gained ground in the 20th century.,0,20,== Origins ==,63788
It is more a methodological approach to the question than a theory; it asks not from where the content or form of the lyric came but rather in what situation or circumstances did it arise.,1,20,== Origins ==,63788
"Under Marxist influence, Erich Köhler, Marc Bloch, and Georges Duby have suggested that the ""essential hegemony"" in the castle of the lord's wife during his absence was a driving force.",2,20,== Origins ==,63788

This theory has been developed away from sociological towards psychological explanation.,4,20,== Origins ==,63788
"Folklore or spring folk ritualAccording to María Rosa Menocal, Alfred Jeanroy first suggested that folklore and oral tradition gave rise to troubadour poetry in 1883.",0,21,== Origins ==,63788

Medieval Latin or mediolatin (Goliardic)Hans Spanke analysed the intertextual connexion between vernacular and medieval Latin (such as Goliardic) songs.,0,22,== Origins ==,63788
"This theory is supported by Reto Bezzola, Peter Dronke, and musicologist Jacques Chailley.",1,22,== Origins ==,63788
"According to them, trobar means ""inventing a trope"", the trope being a poem where the words are used with a meaning different from their common signification, i.e. metaphor and metonymy.",2,22,== Origins ==,63788
This poem was originally inserted in a serial of modulations ending a liturgic song.,3,22,== Origins ==,63788
Then the trope became an autonomous piece organized in stanza form.,4,22,== Origins ==,63788
"The influence of late 11th-century poets of the ""Loire school"", such as Marbod of Rennes and Hildebert of Lavardin, is stressed in this connexion by Brinkmann.",5,22,== Origins ==,63788
NeoplatonicThis theory is one of the more intellectualising.,0,23,== Origins ==,63788
"The ""ennobling effects of love"" in specific have been identified as neoplatonic.",1,23,== Origins ==,63788
It is viewed either as a strength or weakness that this theory requires a second theory about how the neoplatonism was transmitted to the troubadours; perhaps it can be coupled with one of the other origins stories or perhaps it is just peripheral.,2,23,== Origins ==,63788
