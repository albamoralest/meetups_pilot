"When he was still a young boy, he and Louis, who by then had become an aspiring guitarist, would disguise their age from police by putting on long pants before going to Basin Street to shine shoes for a nickel a shine, hoping to get in on the music scene and get advice or even tutelage from their favorite musicians in the District while shoe-shining.",8,2,== Early life and career in New Orleans ==,194548
"As such, Keppard did not receive any formal musical training and may have been a non-reader who, instead of reading arrangements, most likely learned all of his parts by ear and used his powerful and imaginative abilities to improvise parts that were even better.",9,2,== Early life and career in New Orleans ==,194548

He did not begin playing cornet until he was sixteen.,12,2,== Early life and career in New Orleans ==,194548

"Louis Keppard led the Magnolia Orchestra, which became the regular band at Huntz's and Nagel's cabaret on Iberville in the District.",19,2,== Early life and career in New Orleans ==,194548

"Indeed, many contemporaries have testified that Keppard's playing style was the closest to Bolden's that can be found in the history of jazz recordings and can be considered a more musical and sophisticated extension of Bolden's style: rugged and forceful, clipped and more staccato, and rhythmically closer to ragtime than later New Orleans jazz.",24,2,== Early life and career in New Orleans ==,194548

"Keppard, who signed one photograph of himself with a caption describing himself as the ""star cornetist"" of the ""Creole Ragtime Band,"" probably considered himself the star of the Original Creole Orchestra.",7,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"Although he was the youngest member of the band, he is perhaps the most well-known of all of its members and is more often mentioned in histories of jazz.",8,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
This is most likely because he was one of the few members to make surviving recordings.,9,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"Because of his relative fame compared to the other band members, many assume that the Creole Band was led by Keppard.",10,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548

"An often repeated story says that Keppard didn't want to record because then everyone else could ""steal his stuff.""",19,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548

Another well known story is that he was so worried about being copied that he sometimes played with a handkerchief over his hand to conceal his fingering.,21,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"Keppard's famous tendency to hide his fingerings during performances, however, was most likely a publicity stunt intended only to amuse the crowd.",22,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"After all, a real musician would steal by ear and not by eye.",23,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"In any case, the recording company offered him a $25 flat fee to make a record (a fairly standard rate for non-star performers at the time), far less than he was earning on the Vaudeville circuit.",24,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"His retort to this offer, according to Lawrence Gushee, was: ""Twenty-Five dollars?",25,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"I drink that much gin in a day!""",26,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"The reminiscences of the other members of the Creole Orchestra reveal that another factor was that the Victor representative had asked them to make a ""test recording"" without pay.",27,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"The band balked, fearing it was a ploy to have them make records without being paid.",28,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
"Another popular rumor which traveled through some of the New York jazz circles for some time also suggested that Keppard had refused to record because he had been afraid of being cheated by the record company and had demanded the same fees as that of the Victor Company's highest paid and best-selling artist of the time, Enrico Caruso.",29,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548
The band continued touring successfully until the group finally broke up in 1918.,30,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548

"They were so popular, in fact, that, a few years after the band dissolved, Peyton asserted that ""when they hit Broadway they were a great sensation and would be on the road today were it not for dissatisfaction among themselves and the loss of several of their members by death.""",32,4,== Original Creole Orchestra ==,194548

"About 1917, Keppard settled in Chicago, which would remain his home (except for briefly going to the East Coast to work with Tim Brymn's band about 1920).",0,6,== Career in Chicago ==,194548
"Soon after he had settled himself into the Chicago jazz scene, however, King Oliver became Chicago's ""cornet king"" and was said to have attracted crowds by ""thrusting his horn out of a window and blowing Keppard down.""",1,6,== Career in Chicago ==,194548
"Nevertheless, Keppard did well in finding continuous employment with a wide range of bandleaders, at one point leading his own group with Jimmie Noone on clarinet and Paul Barbarin on drums.",2,6,== Career in Chicago ==,194548
"Keppard worked in Chicago both as a soloist and with the bands of Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, Erskine Tate, Doc Cook (for several years), Don Pasqual, Lil Hardin Armstrong, Ollie Powers, and John Wycliffe, all of which were highly respected local bands.",0,7,== Career in Chicago ==,194548
Keppard was one of the first to bring jazz to the West Coast.,1,7,== Career in Chicago ==,194548
"Don Pasqual, who played reed instruments for Doc Cook for some time, had much to say about Keppard's contributions to Doc Cook's band:",2,7,== Career in Chicago ==,194548

"Later, Andrew Hilaire and Johnny St. Cyr joined the band.",1,8,== Career in Chicago ==,194548

"Sidney Bechet believed it was because Keppard was a ""good-time guy"" that he refused the Victor Company's offer to make the first jazz recordings while he was still playing with the Original Creole Orchestra.",0,11,== Recordings ==,194548
"In other words, he simply didn't want to make the recordings because the Victor Company represented big business and commercialization.",1,11,== Recordings ==,194548
"Thus, if Keppard had agreed to make recordings for them with the Original Creole Band, the music would no longer have been for pure enjoyment but would have been turned into a commodity.",2,11,== Recordings ==,194548
"In the Victor Company files, there is a listing for an unnumbered test recording for a song called ""Tack 'em Down"" made by the ""Creole Jass Band"" on December 2, 1918 nearly two years after Keppard's first performance in New York.",3,11,== Recordings ==,194548

"The ODJB's rendition of ""Livery Stable Blues"" came from a song Freddie Keppard performed.",7,11,== Recordings ==,194548

"As Mutt Carey, a fellow New Orleans trumpeter recalled, when Keppard was feeling good, ""he'd get devilish sometimes and he'd neigh on the trumpet like a horse"" to be humorous.",9,11,== Recordings ==,194548

Keppard could play any kind of song good.,4,12,== Recordings ==,194548
"Technique, attack, tone, and ideas were all there.",5,12,== Recordings ==,194548
He didn't have very much formal musical education but he sure was a natural musician.,6,12,== Recordings ==,194548
All you had to do was play a number for him once and he had it… he was a natural!,7,12,== Recordings ==,194548
When Freddie got to playing… he was no freak man like Joe Oliver.,8,12,== Recordings ==,194548
Freddie was a trumpet player,9,12,== Recordings ==,194548
anyway you'd grab him.,10,12,== Recordings ==,194548
He could play sweet,11,12,== Recordings ==,194548
and then he could play hot.,12,12,== Recordings ==,194548
He'd play sweet sometimes and then turn around and knock the socks off you with something hot.,13,12,== Recordings ==,194548
"Willie Humphrey, a New Orleans jazz clarinetist, had also played with Freddie Keppard around the summer of 1919, at a time when half of New Orleans followed Joe Oliver and half the town followed Keppard.",0,13,== Recordings ==,194548

"Alberta Hunter, a blues singer and another artist who had been largely forgotten until she made her comeback in her eighties, also wondered why Freddie Keppard was often overlooked or unmentioned in many accounts of the histories of jazz.",2,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"""You know,"" she reportedly said, ""he doesn't get the credit he should get.",3,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"""Some of the commentary on Keppard's playing, however, is admittedly quite contradictory.",4,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Of those who spoke of Keppard as a ""freak player,"" most referred to him in this way because of his ability to utilize a variety of mutes and playing techniques, such as flutter-tonguing and half-valving.",5,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Others, however, insist that Keppard was a ""much straighter player"" than Joe Oliver.",6,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Additionally, while qualified listeners like Jelly Roll Morton were full of praise for Keppard's playing style, others like the younger Louis Armstrong is said to have described Keppard's playing as ""fancy"" (in an unflattering sense of the word).",7,15,== Recordings ==,194548
Keppard made all his known recordings in Chicago from 1923 to 1927.,8,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"The only recordings he is certainly on are three sides under his own name (""Freddie Keppard's Jazz Cardinals""), two with Erskine Tate's Vendome Orchestra, and a dozen with Doc Cook's Orchestra.",9,15,== Recordings ==,194548
These feature Keppard on second cornet.,10,15,== Recordings ==,194548

"His ""Stockyard Strut"" is an improvisation on the chords of ""Tiger Rag"".",12,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Keppard contributed to the Doc Cook recordings, where he plays the 'walking-talking' style of Stomp Cornet that pre-dates jazz by about a half generation.",13,15,== Recordings ==,194548
It follows ragtime by the same margin.,14,15,== Recordings ==,194548
Keppard may have appeared on a few other recordings; many more are often dubiously attributed to him.,15,15,== Recordings ==,194548

"""Several musicians with clear memories of Buddy Bolden said that Freddie Keppard sounded the most like Bolden of anyone who recorded.",18,15,== Recordings ==,194548

"Keppard did not have a sound of his own and he came up in between Buddy, Oliver, and Armstrong.",20,15,== Recordings ==,194548
Keppard was extremely talented but was not unique.,21,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Others, like Lawrence Gushee, insist that Keppard did have a unique approach to playing the cornet, which simply became overshadowed by Louis Armstrong's powerful influence.",22,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Gushee describes Keppard as ""frequently on top of the beat or [anticipating] it,"" making his ""phrasing excitable, even tense.""",23,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Whereas ""Armstrong seems to favor extended four or eight-measure structure, Keppard [built] his units out of shorter modules"" underscored by vibrato.",24,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Gushee also argues that Keppard used a much more ""rapid vibrato, more like an ornament, that could be used anyplace in a phrase.""",25,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Armstrong and Keppard met, but unfortunately, their first encounter was a letdown; instead of playing with Armstrong on the band stand, Keppard left in order to talk to customers, including an attractive blonde.",26,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Many contemporaries said that either Keppard was past his prime when he recorded or that his recordings do not do him justice, as Keppard's health was already declining by the time he recorded in 1926.",27,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Even with the constraints, the recordings demonstrate that Keppard was a very proficient player and an adventurous improviser.",28,15,== Recordings ==,194548
"Keppard's style is much more raggy and characterized by a ""brusque and staccato style"" compared to Oliver's blues-tinged style.",29,15,== Recordings ==,194548
