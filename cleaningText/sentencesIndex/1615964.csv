"Katz's work is vital, not least because the first exponents of the Jamaican boogie and ska sound of the early fifties which he focuses on initially are increasingly few in number.",1,15,== Critical reaction ==,1615964
His project is a welcome contribution to the small number of well researched and persuasively written books on reggae. ...,2,15,== Critical reaction ==,1615964
Katz's own narrative and the interviews themselves are full of compelling details ...,3,15,== Critical reaction ==,1615964

But the patience and persistence required to assemble this kind of work clearly reflect the author's passion for reggae...,5,15,== Critical reaction ==,1615964

"Over the course of 350 jam-packed pages, this quickly becomes ponderous.",4,17,== Critical reaction ==,1615964
"To his credit, Katz has gathered a staggering amount of engrossing and entertaining information.",5,17,== Critical reaction ==,1615964

A review of Solid Foundation in Reggaezine said:,0,18,== Critical reaction ==,1615964
"To some extent any book on reggae must rely on oral testimony, due to the absence of formal written documentation, but Solid Foundation is exactly what it says, built upon the author's 'formal interviews conducted with more than 250 of reggae's prime movers over 15 years'.",0,19,== Critical reaction ==,1615964
