"Hebert claims that postmodernist discourse no longer offers an adequate explanation for contemporary musical practices, and that most music philosophy suffers from an ethnocentric orientation.",0,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited a period of ""digital prehistory"" to enter a phase of ""data saturation"" through ubiquitous mass surveillance, causing conditions he describes as ""glocalimbodied,"" meaning that local and global forces converge to ""stamp"" the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media.",1,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"Hebert also argues that music, now most commonly consumed in digital form, may be understood as ""content"" in a ""selfie-stick society"".",2,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"In his view, this new context results in music creation and consumption increasingly transcending earlier connections to space and time, engendering both a blurring and reactionary institutionalization of local genres and historical styles.",3,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re-envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of ""flexibility"", with inclusion of marginalized traditions, cultivation of both acoustic and digital competencies, and rejection of any ties to ""aesthetic fundamentalism"", techno-utopianism, militarism and nationalism.",4,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"Music scholars have noted that Hebert ""believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity',"" and that ""Music learned in school should have some connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an ‘embodied practice situated in sociocultural contexts’.""",5,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"An advocate for increased contemporary music, music technology, and popular music in schools, Hebert nevertheless warns that these should not be seen as panacea for poor teaching or inadequate funding and facilities, and that historical traditions – including the heritage of ""classical"" art music – still legitimately require ample space in school education.",6,20,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575

"While largely accepted, some of Hebert's conclusions have faced opposition from other scholars.",0,21,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"His research in Japan controversially suggests that some important aspects of music history are inaccurately ""remembered"", and he has argued that similar issues may be found in common music history textbooks in the US and elsewhere.",1,21,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"Hebert asserts that music contests can have not only positive, but also negative consequences for participants and the musical traditions they display, and require careful design for desirable outcomes.",2,21,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
Some music educators defend traditional pedagogies that Hebert and others claim need to be redeveloped or supplemented with new approaches.,3,21,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
Robert Walker and Roger Scruton would disagree with Hebert's position regarding the value of popular music pedagogy.,4,21,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
"Vincent Bates has argued that a ""cosmopolitan"" perspective may already receive excessive emphasis in the field of music education, while Thomas Adam Regelski has suggested that ""culture"" – a concept emphasized in much of Hebert's writings – is too imprecise to be useful to music teachers.",5,21,== Philosophical orientation ==,45197575
