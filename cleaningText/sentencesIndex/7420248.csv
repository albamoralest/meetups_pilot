"Building on the work of W. J. Courthope, Hardin Craig, E. B. Everitt, Seymour Pitcher and others, Sams' thesis was that ""Shakespeare was an early starter who rewrote nobody's plays but his own"", and that the young playwright ""may have been a master of structure before he was a master of language"".",3,5,== Shakespeare ==,7420248

his own first versions of famous later plays.,8,5,== Shakespeare ==,7420248

"""Authorial revision of early plays is the only rational alternative.""",12,5,== Shakespeare ==,7420248

"By Sams' authorship- and dating-arguments, Shakespeare wrote not only the earliest ""modern"" chronicle play, The Troublesome Reign, c. 1588, but also ""the earliest known modern comedy and tragedy"", A Shrew and the Ur-Hamlet (substantially = the 1603 Quarto).",17,5,== Shakespeare ==,7420248
"Sams also argued, more briefly, that ""there is some evidence of Shakespearean authorship of A Pleasant Commodie of Fair Em the Millers Daughter, with the loue of William the Conqueror, written before 1586, and of The Lamentable Tragedie of Locrine written mid-1580s and ""newly set foorth, ouerseene and corrected, by W.S."" in 1595.",0,6,== Shakespeare ==,7420248

"""His unwillingness to collude with academics against actors,"" wrote Professor Stephen Logan, ""springs from a deep respect for the past.",4,6,== Shakespeare ==,7420248
