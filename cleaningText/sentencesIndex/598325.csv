"It was only at the age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of Richard Wagner—which struck him with all the force of a religious revelation—that Chamberlain became not only a Wagnerite, but an ardent Germanophile and Francophobe.",1,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"As he put later, it was then he realized the full ""degeneracy"" of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, whom Chamberlain viewed as one of the great geniuses of all time.",2,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain finally found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had been unsuccessfully seeking to find in British and French cultures.",3,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Further increasing his love of Germany  was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst, and she with him.",4,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"As Chamberlain's wealthy, elitist family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst on the grounds that she was socially unsuitable for him, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money.",5,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic ""land of love"", a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity.",6,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"In 1883–1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker.",7,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325

"Together with his friend, the French writer Édouard Dujardin, Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner's music.",10,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Thereafter he settled in Dresden, where ""he plunged heart and soul into the mysterious depths of Wagnerian music and philosophy, the metaphysical works of the Master probably exercising as strong an influence upon him as the musical dramas"".",11,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Chamberlain immersed himself in philosophical writings, and became a Völkisch author, one of those concerned more with a highly racist understanding of art, culture, civilisation and spirit than with quantitative physical distinctions between groups.",12,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
This is evidenced by his huge treatise on Immanuel Kant with its comparisons.,13,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
His knowledge of Friedrich Nietzsche is demonstrated in that work (p. 183) and in Foundations (p. 153n).,14,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"It was during his time in Dresden that Chamberlain came to embrace völkisch thought through his study of Wagner, and from 1884 onwards, anti-Semitic and racist statements became the norm in his letters to his family in Britain.",15,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"In 1888, Chamberlain wrote to his family proclaiming his joy at the death of the Emperor Friedrich III, a strong opponent of anti-Semitism whom Chamberlain called a ""Jewish liberal"", and rejoicing that his anti-Semitic son Wilhelm II was now on the throne.",16,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
June 1888 was an auspicious month for Chamberlain.,17,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325

"Chamberlain later recalled that Cosima Wagner had ""electrified"" him as he felt the ""deepest love"" for Wagner's widow while Wagner wrote to a friend that she felt a ""great friendship"" with Chamberlain ""because of his outstanding learning and dignified character"".",19,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
Wagner came to regard Chamberlain as her surrogate son.,20,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Under her influence, Chamberlain abandoned his previous belief that art was a separate entity from other fields and came to embrace the völkisch belief of the unity of race, art, nation and politics.",21,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Saxony was a center of völkisch activity in the late 19th century, and in the elections to the Saxon Landtag in 1893, völkisch candidates won 6 out of the 16 seats.",22,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Chamberlain's status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was to a certain extent an outsider in his adopted country – a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent.",23,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"In a classic case of being plus royaliste que le roi (more royalist than the king), Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to völkisch politics.",24,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time.",25,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Chamberlain's friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English ""individualist"" who ""never saw Germany as it really is"", instead having an idealized, almost mythic view of Germany and the Germans.",26,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain.",27,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"To compensate, Chamberlain became ""überdeutsch"", the man who wanted to be more German than the Germans.",28,20,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"By this time Chamberlain had met his first wife, the Prussian Anna Horst, whom he would divorce in 1905 after 28 years of marriage.",0,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Chamberlain was an admirer of Richard Wagner, and wrote several commentaries on his works including Notes sur Lohengrin  (""Notes on Lohengrin"") (1892), an analysis of Wagner's drama (1892), and a biography (1895), emphasising in particular the heroic Teutonic aspects in the composer's works.",1,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Stewart Spencer, writing in Wagner Remembered, described Chamberlain's edition of Wagner letters as ""one of the most egregious attempts in the history of musicology to misrepresent an artist by systematically censoring his correspondence"".",2,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"In particular, Wagner's lively sex life presented a problem for Chamberlain.",3,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Wagner had abandoned his first wife Minna, had an open affair with the married woman Mathilde Wesendonck and had started sleeping with his second wife Cosima while she was still married to her first husband.",4,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
Chamberlain in his Wagner biography went to considerable lengths to distort the Master's love-life such as implying that Wagner's relationship with Cosima von Bülow only started after the death of her first husband.,5,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"During his time in Dresden, Chamberlain like many other völkisch activists became fascinated with Hindu mythology and legend, and learned Sanskrit in order to read the ancient Indian epics like the Vedas and the Upanishads in their original form.",6,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"In these stories about ancient Aryan heroes conquering the Indian subcontinent, Chamberlain found a very appealing world governed by a rigid caste system with social inferiors firmly locked into their place; full of larger-than-life Aryan gods and aristocratic heroes and a world that focused on the spiritual at the expense of the material.",7,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"Since by this time, historians, archaeologists and linguists had all accepted that the Aryans (""light ones"") of Hindu legend were an Indo-European people, Chamberlain had little trouble arguing that these Aryans were in fact Germanic peoples, and modern Germans had much to learn from Hinduism, stating ""in the night of the inner life ...",8,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"the Indian ... finds his way in the dark more surely than anyone"".",9,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"For Chamberlain the Hindu texts offered a body of pure Aryan thought that made it possible to find the harmony of humanity and nature, which provided the unity of thought, purpose and action that provided the necessary spirituality for Aryan peoples to find true happiness in a world being destroyed by a soulless materialism.",10,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325
"The popularity of the Hindu texts with the völkisch movement explains why the swastika, an ancient Indian symbol, was adopted by the völkisch activists as one of their symbols.",11,21,== Wagnerite ==,598325

"During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, influenced by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied in the works of Richard Wagner and the French racist writer Arthur de Gobineau.",1,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
"In his book Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, the aristocratic Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners, had developed the theory of an Aryan master race as a way of bolstering his social standing as he believed that French aristocrats like himself were the descendants of the Germanic Franks who had conquered the Roman province of Gaul while ordinary French people were the descendants of racially inferior Latin and Celtic peoples.",2,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
"Wagner had met Gobineau while on vacation in Rome in 1876, and the two had become friends.",3,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
"Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau's theories, but could not accept Gobineau's theory of inevitable racial decay amongst what was left of the ""Aryan race"", instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans.",4,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
"The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer opined that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely ""redemptive anti-semitism"", a type of völkisch anti-semitism that could explain all in the world in regards to Jew-hatred and offer a form of ""redemption"" for the anti-Semitic.",5,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
Chamberlain had attended Wagner's Bayreuth Festival in 1882 and struck up a close correspondence with his widow Cosima.,6,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
"In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death, he married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, Franz Liszt's granddaughter and Richard Wagner's daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow – despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner's daughter).",7,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325

"Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation.",10,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:,11,23,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325
"Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the 'firm ground of nature'; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness.",0,24,== Champion of Wagnerism ==,598325

"Because Bosnia-Herzegovina was still officially part of the Ottoman Empire, neither province was represented in the Austrian Reichsrat or the Hungarian Diet, and instead the two provinces were in practice a colony of Austria-Hungary.",2,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper.,3,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
"Chamberlain's articles about Bosnia reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy, with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for their utterly undemocratic rule in Bosnia-Herzegovina.",4,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
"Chamberlain wrote that what he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner's dictum: ""Absolute monarch – free people!""",5,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
"Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic ""parliamentary regime"", instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was best for them.",6,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
"Equally important in Chamberlain's Bosnian articles was his celebration of ""natural man"" who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society.",7,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
"At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages.",8,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
"Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the ""westernization"" being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia.",9,29,== Vienna years ==,598325
Chamberlain wrote about the average Bosnian:,10,29,== Vienna years ==,598325

"When we have civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner—then Bosnia will no longer be interesting to us.",1,30,== Vienna years ==,598325
"Chamberlain's awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature.",0,31,== Vienna years ==,598325
"In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the Middle Ages and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution.",1,31,== Vienna years ==,598325
"In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhythm of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal.",2,31,== Vienna years ==,598325

The campaign by the annexationists against Bethmann-Hollweg was in large part motivated by the fact that the annexationists believed that Bethmann-Hollweg was not one of them.,12,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Had Chamberlain or any of the other annexationists been aware of the secret September Programme of 1914, where Bethmann-Hollweg planned to announce his intentions for annexing much of Europe and Africa after the soon to be expected fall of Paris, they would have had a different opinion of Bethmann-Hollweg.",13,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Under the constitution of 1871, the Reichstag had limited powers, but one of those was the right to vote on the budget.",14,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"In the 1912 Reichstag elections, the anti-militarist Social Democrats had won the largest number of seats in the Reichstag.",15,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
Thus Bethmann-Hollweg had to work with the SPD to get the budgets passed to finance the war.,16,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"In August 1914, the government had been able to persuade the majority of the SPD to support the war on the grounds that Russia was supposedly about to attack Germany.",17,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
The SPD broke into two; the Majority Social Democrats supported the war while the minority Independent Social Democrats stayed true to their pacifist beliefs and opposed the war.,18,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"The Majority Social Democrats agreed to support the war to the extent it was portrayed as a defensive struggle against Russia, but the Majority SPD wanted nothing to do with the annexationists.",19,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Hence, Bethmann-Hollweg's refusal to support the annexationists in public was due to pragmatic political considerations, namely, his need for majority Social Democratic co-operation in the Reichstag as opposed to being against the annexationists as Chamberlain mistakenly believed.",20,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"If the parties supporting annexationists, such as the Conservatives, National Liberals and Free Conservatives, had done better in the 1912 elections, Bethmann-Hollweg would almost certainly have taken a different line in public regarding the demands of the annexationists.",21,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Much of Chamberlain's strident, aggressive and embittered rhetoric reflected the fact that the annexationists were a minority in Germany, albeit a significant, vocal, well organised minority with many influential members inside and outside the government, but a minority nonetheless.",22,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
The majority of the German people did not support the annexationists.,23,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain regarded the refusal of the democratic parties like the left-wing SPD, the right-of-the-centre Zentrum and the liberal Progressives to join the annexationist movement as essentially high treason.",24,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"In August 1916, there occurred what amounted to a military coup d'état when Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff informed Wilhelm and Bethmann-Hollweg that henceforward the Army would no longer obey either the Kaiser or the government, and that from now the Emperor and the Chancellor would now obey the Army.",25,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
In July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff had Bethmann-Hollweg dismissed and replaced with Georg Michaelis as Chancellor.,26,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain's preferred candidate as Chancellor, Admiral Tirpitz, was passed over.",27,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Tirpitz was an intelligent, media-savvy, charismatic political intriguer with a desperate hunger for political power, but the duumvirate of Hindenburg and Ludendorff regarded Tirpitz as Chancellor as too much of a threat to their own power.",28,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"In response to the firing of Bethmann-Hollweg, the democratic parties decided to protest by passing a peace resolution.",29,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"The Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917—in which the SPD, Zentrum and the Progressives all joined forces to vote for a resolution asking the government to start peace talks at once on the basis of a return to the status quo of 1914—""inflamed the paranoia and desperation of the right.",30,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"The annexationists prepared for a war to the knife against the Chancellor and domestic ""traitors"".""",31,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain was disappointed that Tirpitz had not been appointed Chancellor; however, he was overjoyed with Bethmann-Hollweg's sacking and welcomed the military dictatorship of Hindenburg and Ludendorff as giving Germany the sort of government it needed.",32,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain was always inclined to hero worship, and for him, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were the greatest of a long line of German heroes.",33,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain wrote in 1917 that: ""Had Hindenburg and Ludendorff stood on the first day in their rightful place, the peace would in all probability have been dictated in Paris before the end of 1914.""Besides being an annexationist who wanted to see the war end with Germany as the world's greatest power, Chamberlain also advocated a set of wide-ranging changes to German society intended to achieve a ""rebirth"" of Germany.",34,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain wanted to see the Spirit of 1914 made permanent, to convert the wartime Burgfrieden (""peace within a castle under siege"") into a peacetime Volksgemeinschaft (people's community).",35,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"He also wanted a new economic and social system that would be a ""third way"" between capitalism and socialism to bring about the Volksgemeinschaft organized along corporatist lines.",36,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"To achieve this, Chamberlain called for the end to any remaining democratic features the constitution of 1871 still possessed and the creation of a pure dictatorship; for the end of the capitalist system with the state to nationalize huge sections of the economy while at the same time respecting the right to private property; and for the militarization of society on a new scale.",37,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain was somewhat vague about how this corporatist society would work in practice, but what he wanted was rule by an oligarchy of aristocrats, intellectuals, bureaucrats and military officers who would run a ""planned economy"" via ""scientific management"".",38,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"The entire German people (except for the Jews, whom Chamberlain believed did not belong in Germany) were to be united by a common loyalty to the Emperor.",39,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"A fanatical monarchist, Chamberlain saw the monarchy as the bedrock of German life, writing in his 1915 book Politische Ideale: ""Whoever speaks of a republic in Germany belongs on the gallows; the monarchical idea is here a holy law of life.""",40,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"At the same time, Chamberlain envisioned a Germany that would somehow remain the leading industrial power at the forefront of modern technology while at the same time become a romantic, agrarian society where ordinary people would work the land and retain their traditional deference to the aristocracy.",41,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain was also vague about how this could be achieved, writing only that a ""planned economy"", ""scientific management"" and an economically interventionist state committed to social reforms would make it all possible.",42,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"After Germany's diplomatic defeat in the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, Wilhelm II became the Schattenkaiser (the ""Shadow Emperor""), an increasingly reclusive figure who was seen less and less in public.",43,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
The war further reinforced Wilhelm's tendency to avoid the public spotlight as much as possible.,44,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"In private, Chamberlain grew disillusioned with his friend, complaining that instead of being the ""Aryan soldier king"" leading the Reich to victory as he wanted and expected him to be, the Kaiser was a weak leader as the ""Shadow Emperor"" was hiding himself away in deep seclusion from the rest of Germany at his hunting lodges.",45,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Wilhelm's hiding himself away from his own people during the war did immense damage to the prestige of the monarchy, and if the Kaiser's seclusion did not make the November Revolution of 1918 inevitable, it at least made it possible.",46,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"As a monarchist, Chamberlain was worried about how Wilhelm was hurting his own reputation, and often vainly urged the Kaiser to appear in public more often.",47,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain wrote in 1916 that Wilhelm had an ""absolute incapability for judging character"" and was now being ""forced to obey a Frankfurt pimp"", the last being a disparaging reference to Bethmann-Hollweg.",48,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
"Chamberlain was always very careful to avoid attacking Wilhelm in public, but his violent press attacks against Bethmann-Hollweg caused something of a rift with the Kaiser who felt Chamberlain's very public criticism of the Chancellor was also an indirect attack on him.",49,121,== Propagandist of the World War ==,598325
