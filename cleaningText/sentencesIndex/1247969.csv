"The musicologist Gustav Chouqet wrote in 1904 that Hérold's early symphonic, choral and chamber works show that the composer could have excelled in concert works had he continued in that type of composition, but the stage ""possesses an irresistible attraction for a man gifted with ardent imagination and capacity for expressing emotion"", leading Hérold to opera and the ballet.",0,12,== Music ==,1247969

"His score is known to have incorporated some music from an earlier production of the ballet, as well as other contemporary sources, notably Rossini.",10,14,== Music == | === Ballets ===,1247969
"Later productions have added music by Peter Ludwig Hertel, and the most famous number in the piece, the clog dance, is a modern invention, based on one of Hertel's tunes, by John Lanchbery, who revised the whole score in 1959 for Frederick Ashton's production.",11,14,== Music == | === Ballets ===,1247969
"Lanchbery maintained that the orchestration of Hérold's score is inferior to that of his operas, probably because it was hurriedly composed.",12,14,== Music == | === Ballets ===,1247969
"Eugène Scribe's libretto for La Somnambule (which inspired Bellini's opera La sonnambula) led Hérold to produce what Nørlyng describes as a graceful, pastoral score, in which, innovatively, Hérold sought to connect the music to the drama through the use of melodic motifs.",13,14,== Music == | === Ballets ===,1247969

"Betzwieser comments that despite of many deficiencies in the librettos of his early operas, Herold's talent for music drama was clear from the outset, and that he advanced the genre of opéra comique with his colourful and varied orchestration, and his gift for smooth transition between the spoken and sung sections of his works.",0,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"In a 1904 survey of Hérold's work, Chouqet praised La Clochette for its abundance of new and fresh ideas, its stagecraft and original instrumentation.",1,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"He added that although its immediate successors showed the composer's industry and fertility, operas like Le premier venu (1818), Les Troqueurs (1819), L' Amour platonique (1819), and L'Auteur mort et vivant (1820) had ""librettos that were neither interesting nor adapted for music"" .",2,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"Le Muletier (1823), however, is ""full of life and colour, and assured his reputation"".",3,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"Chouqet adds that after the success of the lively Le Muletier it is puzzling that a man of Hérold's literary tastes and culture should have chosen to set dramas ""so tame and uninteresting as L'asthenie (1823), and Le Lapin blanc (1825)"": he concludes that Hérold's urge to compose led him to accept any libretto offered to him.",4,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
By the time of the comedy Marie (1826) Hérold was incorporating elements of both Rossini's and Beethoven's musical language.,5,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"In Betzwieser's view Marie represents ""a crucial turning point in Herold's writing"", and the poet Gérard de Nerval described the work as the ""golden link"" between Hérold's early operas and the later masterpieces Zampa and Le Pré aux clercs.",6,16,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"For Zampa, a variant of the Don Juan story – with a female statue rather than a male one bringing nemesis to the antihero – Hérold wrote an overture that contains five different themes related to the action and score of the opera.",0,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"In the three acts of Zampa Herold, in Betzwieser's view, shows particular skill in differentiating between the traditional numbers of opéra comique, ""from the solo numbers (ballade, barcarole, chanson etc.), used to illustrate the various characters, to the large-scale finales, notable for their skilful variation and the building of a dramatic climax"".",1,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"Berlioz found things to praise in Zampa but thought Hérold lacked a style of his own, yet was neither Italian, nor French, nor German: ""His music strongly resembles those industrial products made in Paris according to processes invented elsewhere and slightly modified; it is Parisian music"", which, Berlioz thought, was why the Parisian middle classes loved it.",2,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"But Betzwieser observes that Zampa's Romantic features made it highly successful outside France, and writing in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians the British critic Elizabeth Forbes commented in 1992, ""All the music is perfectly suited to its subject, while the portions devoted to Zampa and the statue are highly dramatic as well as melodious"".",3,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
Forbes writes that Le Pré aux clerks is acknowledged by composers and musicians as one of the finest of its period.,4,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"The story covers similar ground to Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots, but in an intimate, more personal way.",5,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"Forbes finds the score ""a chain of fine numbers, extremely melodious and pretty, but also dramatically well suited to the various characters"", with a balance between comedy and romance.",6,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"In a 2016 analysis of the score, Gérard Condé writes, ""Though doubtless derivative in certain respects, the score of Le Pré aux clercs went on to serve as a recipe book for the next half-century: Lecocq, Offenbach, Varney, Audran and even Bizet consulted it with profit, each to his own ends"".",7,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"In the overture Hérold does not use themes from the opera, but ranges from an opening fugue to a quick march.",8,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
"Wagner and Smetana both knew the opera well, and in another 2016 analysis, Damien Colas writes that echoes of Le Pré aux clercs may be found in the former's Das Liebesverbot (1836) and the latter's The Bartered Bride (1866).",9,17,== Music == | === Operas ===,1247969
