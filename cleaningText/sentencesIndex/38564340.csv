"Charles Isherwood, in his review for The New York Times, wrote: ""More than 50 songs...are performed in 'Motown,' usually, alas, in truncated versions.",0,76,== Critical response ==,38564340
"Most are simply presented as concert versions by the actors playing the artists who made them famous, but a few are shoehorned awkwardly into the story as 'book' songs....",1,76,== Critical response ==,38564340
Making way for so much music means that 'Motown' breezily scrimps on storytelling.,2,76,== Critical response ==,38564340

"Rather than giving us a complex portrait on this fascinating businessman, the show's shoddily written book is essentially a self-serving theatrical memoir in which Gordy gets to tell his life story.",0,77,== Critical response ==,38564340

"Perhaps that is why Gordy and his creative team, led by director Charles Randolph-Wright, seem so worried they left out an audience favorite that they crammed in more than 50 hits.",2,77,== Critical response ==,38564340
"The result is that too few of the beloved Motown classics receive the kind of full-scale, all-out renditions they deserve.",3,77,== Critical response ==,38564340
"An early, extended version of Martha & The Vandellas' 'Dancing in the Street' proves not just a high point (abetted by energetic choreography from Patricia Wilcox and Warren Adams), but a false promise of what lies ahead....",4,77,== Critical response ==,38564340
"The one person who truly shines, though, is Valisia LeKae as Gordy's longtime paramour, superstar Diana Ross.",5,77,== Critical response ==,38564340
It's not just her almost spot-on re-creation of Miss Ross' breathy voice and steely demeanor that commands our attention.,6,77,== Critical response ==,38564340
