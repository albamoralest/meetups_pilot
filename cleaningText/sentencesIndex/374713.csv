"Claude Thornhill had employed hornist John Graas in 1942, and composer-arranger Bob Graettinger had scored for horns and tubas with the Stan Kenton orchestra, but the ""Kenton sound"" was in the context of a dense orchestral wall of sound that Evans avoided.",6,6,== Career ==,374713

"The demands of the score for Porgy and Bess were legendary, from the very first note for the lead trumpet.",0,8,== Career ==,374713
"The limited time allotted for rehearsals revealed that the ability to read such a challenging score was not consistent among jazz musicians, and there are many audible errors.",1,8,== Career ==,374713
"Yet the recording is now regarded by many as one of the greatest reinterpretations of Gershwin's music in any musical style, because Evans and Davis were each devoted to going outside the ""mainstream"" of commercial expectations for jazz musicians.",2,8,== Career ==,374713

"The presence of four of the most acclaimed young bassists (Richard Davis, Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, and Ben Tucker) along with veteran Milt Hinton would ordinarily indicate that each is used individually for separate tracks, but Evans's scores usually required at least two bassists on any given track, some playing arco (with the bow) and some pizzicato (plucking with fingers, the standard jazz method).",4,10,== Career ==,374713
"These arrangements frequently featured greatly slowed-down tempos with polyrhythmic percussion and no prevailing ""beat"".",5,10,== Career ==,374713

"Working in the free jazz and jazz-rock idioms, he gained a new generation of admirers.",3,12,== Career ==,374713

Hendrix's 1970 death precluded a scheduled meeting with Evans to discuss having Hendrix collaborate with a big band led by Evans.,5,12,== Career ==,374713

"In contrast to his intricate scores for large ensembles, which required precision orchestral playing accompanying a single soloist, his later arrangements would feature more unison playing by the entire ensemble, such as on Hendrix's ""Little Wing"", with improvisational touches added throughout by the musicians.",8,12,== Career ==,374713
