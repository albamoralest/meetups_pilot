Koenig did not stop at just making instruments however.,0,9,== Harmonic Motion ==,196224
He would go on to study the graphic method for harmonic motion to which he devoted much time.,1,9,== Harmonic Motion ==,196224
He even further expanded to compound harmonic motion for both parallel and rectangular vibrations.,2,9,== Harmonic Motion ==,196224
These studies helped him to present his apparatus in London in 1862 at an international exhibition.,3,9,== Harmonic Motion ==,196224

Karl Rudolph Koenig produced a variety of devices and acoustic instruments.,0,11,== Products ==,196224
"These devices and instruments include a sound analyzer, tuning forks, double risen, wave machines, resonators, devices for sound visualization, and obtaining ultrasonic frequencies etc.",1,11,== Products ==,196224
One of Koenig's more interesting devices was a watch with the escapement consisting of a tuning fork that could calibrate the main frequencies of any sound.,0,12,== Products ==,196224
This apparatus helped Koenig establish the frequencies of musical tones and allowed him to build a musical scale.,1,12,== Products ==,196224
Another apparatus was a phonograph which could collect sounds by means of a pavilion.,2,12,== Products ==,196224
It could automatically record them in a rotating cylinder by means of a point.,3,12,== Products ==,196224
"Some years later, Thomas Edison developed this device to build the Phonograph known today.",4,12,== Products ==,196224
"Among many other products, Koenig also built measuring instruments which were composed of resonators.",5,12,== Products ==,196224
"He also authored various works on limits of hearing, the physical characterization of vowels and the combination of tones.",6,12,== Products ==,196224
In the late 1800s Koenig found out that people were making cheap copies of his acoustical apparatus.,7,12,== Products ==,196224
"He complained about these knock off instruments, stating that some even had his name on them despite the fact that he had nothing to do with their creation.",8,12,== Products ==,196224

"In 1859, Koenig both published his first catalog, and inverted the phonograph which would play a crucial role for the graphical analysis of sound.",0,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"By inverting the phonograph, Rudolph made it easier to record and store sounds made by the vibrations of air particles.",1,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"Around 1860, along with Hermann von Helmholtz, Rudolph Koenig worked to devise an electronically controlled sound.",2,14,== Timeline ==,196224

"Two years following this in 1862, he began to exhibit the nano-metric flame apparatus (see attached image and description for more information) at the London Exhibition.",4,14,== Timeline ==,196224
This was the first time his nano-metric flame apparatus was displayed to the public.,5,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"In 1865,  Koenig published his second catalog, and was awarded a gold medal from the Societe d'Encouragement pOllr l'lndustrie ntuionale for the use of his instruments in working with the study of acoustics .",6,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"In 1867, his apparatus collection was exhibited in Paris.",7,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"After few exhibitions, many of Koenig's products began to be sold internationally.",8,14,== Timeline ==,196224
A few years following in 1868 he presented all this catalog at the Paris universal exhibition where about 70% of his production was sold.,9,14,== Timeline ==,196224
His wave-sirens as well as most of his other products were shown at Philadelphia exhibition in 1876 at the London Exhibition.,10,14,== Timeline ==,196224
The expansion into the United States was met with difficulties.,11,14,== Timeline ==,196224
Koenig's expectations for the expansion of his business were not working as he had hoped.,12,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"He did have some help from his customers, but was not pleased with the results.",13,14,== Timeline ==,196224
This led to Koenig having to travel to America in order to retrieve his leftover products and bring them back.,14,14,== Timeline ==,196224
It was decided to no longer take part in the exhibition.,15,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"Following all of this he decided to start doing more of his own research, and also began to write many scientific articles while improving upon his instruments.",16,14,== Timeline ==,196224
In 1882 Koenig published Quelques expériences d’acoustique which was the book over his research research of scientific works.,17,14,== Timeline ==,196224
"After his death in 1901, some of Koenig's equipment was sent and is now maintained in Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers, Paris.",18,14,== Timeline ==,196224
The Smithsonian Institution has since began a collection of Koenig's apparatus including some of his tuning forks.,19,14,== Timeline ==,196224
These were donated to the museum by the U.S. Military Academy.,20,14,== Timeline ==,196224
Another large amount of Koenig's apparatuses is owned by the University of Toronto’s physics department.,21,14,== Timeline ==,196224
