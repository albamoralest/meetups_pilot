"I couldn't imagine — he was the first, what I call a good banjo player.""",9,5,== Early life ==,60627

"Scruggs is noted for popularizing a three-finger banjo-picking style now called ""Scruggs style"" that has become a defining characteristic of bluegrass music.",0,7,== Development ==,60627
"Prior to Scruggs, most banjo players used the frailing or clawhammer technique, which consists of holding the fingers bent like a claw and moving the entire hand in a downward motion so that the strings are struck with the back of the middle fingernail.",1,7,== Development ==,60627
This motion is followed by striking the thumb on a single string.,2,7,== Development ==,60627
"The three-finger style of playing is radically different from frailing; the hand remains stationary and only the fingers and thumb move, somewhat similar to classical guitar technique.",3,7,== Development ==,60627
"Scruggs style also involves using picks on three digits, each plucking individual strings — downward with the thumb, then upward with the index and middle finger in sequence.",4,7,== Development ==,60627
"When done skillfully and in rapid sequence, the style allows any digit (though usually the thumb) to play a melody, while the other two digits play arpeggios of the melody line.",5,7,== Development ==,60627
"The use of picks gives each note a louder percussive attack, creating an exciting effect, described by The New York Times as ""like thumbtacks plinking rhythmically on a tin roof"".",6,7,== Development ==,60627
This departure from traditional playing elevated the banjo to become more of a solo instrument—a promotion from its former role of providing background rhythm or serving as a comedian's prop—and popularized the instrument in several genres of music.,7,7,== Development ==,60627
"Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he said the three-finger style was the most common way to play the five-string banjo in his hometown in western North Carolina.",8,7,== Development ==,60627
"An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt ""Snuffy"" Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style.",9,7,== Development ==,60627

"He was idly playing a song called ""Reuben"" and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two.",12,7,== Development ==,60627
"""That excited me to no end"", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling ""I've got it"".",13,7,== Development ==,60627
From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it.,14,7,== Development ==,60627
Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style.,15,7,== Development ==,60627
"Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins.",16,7,== Development ==,60627
"Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it ""a syncopated roll that was quite different.""",17,7,== Development ==,60627
"On the subject, John Hartford said, ""Here's the way I feel about it.",18,7,== Development ==,60627
Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time — maybe since 1840.,19,7,== Development ==,60627

He and his brother Horace had experimented with it when they were growing up.,1,14,== Flatt and Scruggs ==,60627
