"144 )  Here he showed that John von Neumann's argument does not prove the impossibility of hidden variables, as was widely claimed, due to its reliance on a physical assumption that is not valid for quantum mechanics—namely, that the probability-weighted average of the sum of observable quantities equals the sum of the average values of each of the separate observable quantities.: 141  Bell subsequently claimed, ""The proof of von Neumann is not merely false but foolish!"".: 88  In this same work, Bell showed that a stronger effort at such a proof (based upon Gleason's theorem) also fails to eliminate the hidden variables program.",3,13,== Biography == | === Critique of von Neumann's proof ===,169917
