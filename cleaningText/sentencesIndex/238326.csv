"As an active painter for nearly six decades, Frankenthaler went through a variety of phases and stylistic shifts.",0,6,== Style and technique ==,238326
"Initially associated with abstract expressionism because of her focus on forms latent in nature, Frankenthaler is identified with the use of fluid shapes, abstract masses, and lyrical gestures.",1,6,== Style and technique ==,238326

"""Frankenthaler's official artistic career was launched in 1952 with the exhibition of Mountains and Sea.",4,6,== Style and technique ==,238326
"Throughout the 1950s, her works tended to be centered compositions, meaning the majority of the pictorial incident took place in the middle of the canvas itself, while the edges were of little consequence to the compositional whole.",5,6,== Style and technique ==,238326
"In 1957, Frankenthaler began to experiment with linear shapes and more organic, sun-like, rounded forms in her works.",6,6,== Style and technique ==,238326
"In the 1960s, her style shifted towards the exploration of symmetrical paintings, as she began to place strips of colors near the edges of her paintings, thus involving the edges as a part of the compositional whole.",7,6,== Style and technique ==,238326
With this shift in composition came a general simplification of Frankenthaler's style.,8,6,== Style and technique ==,238326
"She began to make use of single stains and blots of solid color against white backgrounds, often in the form of geometric shapes.",9,6,== Style and technique ==,238326

"Frankenthaler often painted onto unprimed canvas with oil paints that she heavily diluted with turpentine, a technique that she named ""soak stain.""",0,10,== Style and technique == | === Technique ===,238326
"This allowed for the colors to soak directly into the canvas, creating a liquefied, translucent effect that strongly resembled watercolor.",1,10,== Style and technique == | === Technique ===,238326
"Soak stain was also said to be the ultimate fusing of image and canvas, drawing attention to the flatness of the painting itself.",2,10,== Style and technique == | === Technique ===,238326

"John Elderfield wrote that the watercolors of Paul Cézanne and John Marin were important early influences:Watercolor... expands the brightness and flatness of plein-air painting because it visibly reveals these qualities in the whiteness of its support, which always makes its presence felt due to the insubstantiality of its covering.",0,17,== Influences ==,238326
"Marin and Cézanne were important to Frankenthaler not only for their watercolors or for the lightness of their work, but, more importantly, because both of them had liberated their oil paintings by treating them like watercolors, which was what Frankenthaler began to do...",1,17,== Influences ==,238326
In Cézanne’s case this transposition of techniques also encouraged him to leave uncovered areas of white canvas between patches of thinned-down oil.,2,17,== Influences ==,238326
