Meyer was an early advocate of behaviourism in America.,0,6,== Career == | === Behaviourism ===,62223591
"In his book, The Psychology of the Other, he argues that psychology should focus on behaviour instead of the mind.",1,6,== Career == | === Behaviourism ===,62223591
"Meyer did not deny the existence of consciousness like the other behaviourists at that time, he was simply against the utilization of introspection as a scientific tool.",2,6,== Career == | === Behaviourism ===,62223591
His reasoning behind this was that he felt that it was not necessary to study the mind to understand human behaviour.,3,6,== Career == | === Behaviourism ===,62223591
He thought that one just needed to study the nervous law which oversees human behaviour to understand behaviour.,4,6,== Career == | === Behaviourism ===,62223591
Later in life Meyer taught courses about aesthetics as they had captured his attention during his undergraduate days.,5,6,== Career == | === Behaviourism ===,62223591

Meyer also contributed to the field of language.,0,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591
He contends that infants learn speech sounds through impersonation.,1,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591
"At first, audial speech sounds are a reflex in the young.",2,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591
They hear a sound and react by shaping a comparable sound.,3,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591
"After some time, this impersonation stops.",4,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591
Acquiring speech sounds is dependent on whether or not making a similar sound is valuable to an individual or not.,5,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591
This loss of reflex is the reason why people cannot learn new dialects easily.,6,8,== Career == | === Language ===,62223591

Meyer started developing his work during the year 1894 at the University of Berlin when he became a pupil to Carl Stumpf.,0,10,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"During his time as a pupil, he was described as having a technical ingenuity that assisted Meyer in developing instruments to research music theory.",1,10,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"During his years studying under Stumpf, he developed his theory of cochlear function.",2,10,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"His main source of data was ""introspective observations of difference tones, of the relative intensities of tones in a compound tone, and of the differences in relative intensity of tones sounded simultaneously and separately”.",3,10,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"From this theory, he developed a hypothesis about ""the anatomical and physiological properties of the ear"" where the assumption was that ""the inner ear is a hydraulic system, that the effective cochlear oscillations occur in the basilar membrane, that this membrane is inelastic, and that its motions passively follow the motions of the stapes"".",4,10,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
This received little attention until the year 1966.,5,10,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"After having a falling out with Stumpf, he migrated to London and spent time in the psychological lab of James Sully at the University of London for 6 months.",0,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"Here he worked on developing an apparatus where a deaf person could even compose, as well as worked on a theory of harmony.",1,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
Meyer then travelled to America and spend time at Clark University and later the University of Missouri.,2,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"Here he published a series of articles, one of them about an experiment he conducted back in Berlin which favoured the view that memory of absolute pitch can be improved with practice.",3,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
This time was also very important as he published his first edition of his theory of music.,4,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"In this first edition, he critiqued his predecessor Stumpf, as well as Hermann von Helmholtz, saying how he felt that their focus of the diatonic scale prevented them from developing a scientific, empirical theory of music.",5,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"He also constructed a scale ""represented by the infinite series of all composites of the powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7"", which he believed was sufficient to study music theory.",6,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"He extended his theory of music during his first year at Missouri, adding that the hearing of simultaneous tones contain two important effects: ""the melodic relationship also heard in successive tones, and consonance"".",7,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"In 1903, Meyer conducted a study related to ""the aesthetic effects of final tones, the intonation of musical intervals, and quartertone music"".",8,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
The findings of the study found that quartertone music in European music became more pleasant with increased familiarity (as long as it followed the “general laws of European music”).,9,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"Since some quartertones were also present in Oriental music, he used these findings to support the theory that the psychological laws of music are the same all over the world, even though a good amount of this study relied on his own interpretation of certain results.",10,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"Some of his final works included trying to develop tests that measured a variety of factors as well as trying to find a scientific music staff that would not require musical signs (ex. flats), but these results were never published.",11,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
"He also developed the musical arithmetic in 1929, which discusses the neurological implications of music perception, but this lacked reference to previous literature.",12,11,== Career == | === Music theory ===,62223591
