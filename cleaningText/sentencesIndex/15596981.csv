Kissy Klub Versions were unofficial remixes of songs by artists which are played exclusively on Kissy Sell Out's BBC Radio 1 Show.,0,55,== Kissy Klub Versions ==,15596981
The idea to remix songs for a radio show is down to the BBC's rules on conflict of interest which restrict the amount of air time producers such as Kissy can fill with their own material.,1,55,== Kissy Klub Versions ==,15596981
"Since Kissy's own re-edits of tracks have been a widely talked about feature of his DJ sets since 2006, Kissy felt it was important to continue this feature in his radio show and thus the Kissy Klub Version concept was started.",2,55,== Kissy Klub Versions ==,15596981
"During the show's life-span, very few other DJs ever obtained copies of the near 1000 long list of exclusive remixes.",0,56,== Kissy Klub Versions ==,15596981
Efforts were made to release a BBC Kissy Klub Versions CD but failed due to the incredibley complex licensing paperwork it would have involved to clear permissions for a large amount of highly established artists who were unfamiliar with the unusual concept.,1,56,== Kissy Klub Versions ==,15596981
