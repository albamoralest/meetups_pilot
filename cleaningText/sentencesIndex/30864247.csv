"Pinder, along with Moodies recording engineer Derek Varnals and longtime producer Tony Clarke (a Decca staff producer assigned to them from ""Fly Me High"" onwards) managed to devise an innovative way of playing and recording the unwieldy Mellotron to make the sound flow in symphonic waves, as opposed to the sharp cutoff the instrument normally gave.",0,12,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247

"On Edge's ""Higher And Higher"" (1969), Pinder's Mellotron simulated the sound of a rocket blasting off to open the To Our Children's Children's Children album, to which he wrote and sang ""Sun is Still Shining"" and a rare co-written song (with John Lodge), ""Out and In"", on which he also sang lead vocals.",0,17,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247

"Pinder's earlier non-album song ""A Simple Game"" (1968), for which he won an Ivor Novello Award, was used as the B-side of their UK hit single ""Ride My See Saw"" from the ""In Search of the Lost Chord"" album on Deram; both this song and Pinder's  On The Threshold of A Dream song ""So Deep Within You"" (1969) were both later successfully covered by The Four Tops.",0,18,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247

"All three songs had him singing lead vocals, as was usually the case with his compositions.",2,20,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247
"Pinder's composition and lead vocal ""My Song"", a deep, reflective atmospheric item, concluded the Moodies' 1971 album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, on which he also took co-credit with the entire band for the unusual opening track ""Procession"" (an attempt aurally to depict the evolution of vocal and musical harmony through time).",0,21,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247
"He also sang a featured co-lead vocal and solo spot along with Hayward, Lodge and Thomas on Edge's song ""After You Came"".",1,21,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247
"Also in 1971, Pinder guested on John Lennon's Imagine album on the songs ""I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier (I Don't Wanna Die)"" and ""Jealous Guy"", playing tambourine rather than the mellotron he intended to play, because by Pinder's account the tapes in Lennon's mellotron looked like ""a bowl of spaghetti"", hence the switch to tambourine.",0,22,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247
"In 1972, the Moodies, then at the height of their popularity, retreated to Mike Pinder's home studio to record Seventh Sojourn, which included two Pinder-penned and -sung contributions: ""Lost in a Lost World"", and ""When You're A Free Man"", dedicated to Timothy Leary.",0,23,== The Moody Blues == | === 'Core seven' period ===,30864247
