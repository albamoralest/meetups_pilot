Sappho's poetry is still considered extraordinary and her works continue to influence other writers.,2,2,N/A,27784

"There are three sources of information about Sappho's life: her testimonia, the history of her times, and what can be gleaned from her own poetry – although scholars are cautious when reading poetry as a biographical source.",0,4,== Ancient sources ==,27784
Testimonia is a term of art in ancient studies that refers to collections of classical biographical and literary references to classical authors.,1,4,== Ancient sources ==,27784
The testimonia regarding Sappho do not contain references contemporary to Sappho.,2,4,== Ancient sources ==,27784
"The representations of Sappho's life that occur in the testimonia always need to be assessed for accuracy, because many of them are certainly not correct.",3,4,== Ancient sources ==,27784
The testimonia are also a source of knowledge regarding how Sappho's poetry was received in antiquity.,4,4,== Ancient sources ==,27784
"Some details mentioned in the testimonia are derived from Sappho's own poetry, which is of great interest, especially considering the testimonia originate from a time when more of Sappho's poetry was extant than is the case for modern readers.",5,4,== Ancient sources ==,27784

She was from the island of Lesbos and was probably born around 630 BC.,1,6,== Life ==,27784
"Tradition names her mother as Cleïs, though ancient scholars may simply have guessed this name, assuming that Sappho's daughter Cleïs was named after her.",0,7,== Life ==,27784
Sappho's father's name is less certain.,1,7,== Life ==,27784
Ten names are known for Sappho's father from the ancient testimonia; this proliferation of possible names suggests that he was not explicitly named in any of Sappho's poetry.,2,7,== Life ==,27784
The earliest and most commonly attested name for Sappho's father is Scamandronymus.,3,7,== Life ==,27784
"In Ovid's Heroides, Sappho's father died when she was seven.",4,7,== Life ==,27784
"Sappho's father is not mentioned in any of her surviving works, but Campbell suggests that this detail may have been based on a now-lost poem.",5,7,== Life ==,27784
"Sappho's own name is found in numerous variant spellings, even in her own Aeolian dialect; the form that appears in her own extant poetry is Psappho.",6,7,== Life ==,27784
"No reliable portrait of Sappho's physical appearance has survived; all extant representations, ancient and modern, are artists' conceptions.",0,8,== Life ==,27784
"In the Tithonus poem she describes her hair as now white but formerly melaina, i.e. black.",1,8,== Life ==,27784
"A literary papyrus of the second century AD. describes her as pantelos mikra, quite tiny.",2,8,== Life ==,27784
"Alcaeus possibly describes Sappho as ""violet-haired"", which was a common Greek poetic way of describing dark hair.",3,8,== Life ==,27784

"Sappho was said to have three brothers: Erigyius, Larichus, and Charaxus.",5,8,== Life ==,27784
"According to Athenaeus, she often praised Larichus for pouring wine in the town hall of Mytilene, an office held by boys of the best families.",6,8,== Life ==,27784
This indication that Sappho was born into an aristocratic family is consistent with the sometimes rarefied environments that her verses record.,7,8,== Life ==,27784
One ancient tradition tells of a relation between Charaxus and the Egyptian courtesan Rhodopis.,8,8,== Life ==,27784
"Herodotus, the oldest source of the story, reports that Charaxus ransomed Rhodopis for a large sum and that Sappho wrote a poem rebuking him for this.",9,8,== Life ==,27784
"The names of two of the brothers, Charaxus and Larichus, are mentioned in the Brothers Poem, discovered in 2014; the final brother, Erigyius, is mentioned in three ancient sources but nowhere in the extant works of Sappho.",10,8,== Life ==,27784
"She may have had a daughter named Cleïs, who is referred to in two fragments.",11,8,== Life ==,27784
Not all scholars accept that Cleïs was Sappho's daughter.,12,8,== Life ==,27784
"Fragment 132 describes Cleïs as ""παῖς"" (pais), which, as well as meaning ""child"", can also refer to the ""youthful beloved in a male homosexual liaison"".",13,8,== Life ==,27784
"It has been suggested that Cleïs was one of Sappho's younger lovers, rather than her daughter, though Judith Hallett argues that the language used in fragment 132 suggests that Sappho was referring to Cleïs as her daughter.",14,8,== Life ==,27784
"According to the Suda, Sappho was married to Kerkylas of Andros.",15,8,== Life ==,27784
"However, the name appears to have been invented by a comic poet: the name ""Kerkylas"" comes from the word ""κέρκος"" (kerkos), a possible meaning of which is ""penis"", and is not otherwise attested as a name, while ""Andros"", as well as being the name of a Greek island, is a form of the Greek word ""ἀνήρ"" (aner), which means man.",16,8,== Life ==,27784
"Thus, the name may be a joke.",17,8,== Life ==,27784
"Sappho and her family were exiled from Lesbos to Syracuse, Sicily, around 600 BC.",18,8,== Life ==,27784
The Parian Chronicle records Sappho going into exile some time between 604 and 591.,19,8,== Life ==,27784
"This may have been as a result of her family's involvement with the conflicts between political elites on Lesbos in this period, the same reason for the exile of Sappho's contemporary Alcaeus from Mytilene around the same time.",20,8,== Life ==,27784
Later the exiles were allowed to return.,21,8,== Life ==,27784
A tradition going back at least to Menander (Fr.,0,9,== Life ==,27784
"258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of Phaon, a ferryman.",1,9,== Life ==,27784
"This is regarded as ahistorical by modern scholars, perhaps invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a first-person reference in a non-biographical poem.",2,9,== Life ==,27784
