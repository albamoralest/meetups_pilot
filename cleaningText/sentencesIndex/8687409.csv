"Vantoura argues that the accentual system preserved in the Masoretic Text was originally a method of recording hand signals (""chironomy"") by which temple musicians were directed in the performance of music.",0,17,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"Noticing the marks in the version of the Hebrew Bible she used to read, Vantoura affirmed she had read in an unnamed encyclopedia that these signs of cantillation dated back to antiquity and that their real musical meaning was lost.",0,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"This, she said, triggered her curiosity.",1,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"Working step by step, she made the assumption it was significant that the sublinear signs were never absent from the text, while entire verses are totally lacking supralinear signs.",2,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"In her opinion it had to mean that the sublinear signs had to be ""more important"" than the supralinear ones.",3,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
This conclusion formed the basis of her conjectures.,4,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
She focused on the prose te'amim system only.,5,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
That system comprises 8 sublinear signs.,6,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"She made the hypothesis that it corresponded to the eight degrees of a musical scale, particularly of a tonal scale, (the diatonic scale - C, D, E, etc. - being the oldest).",7,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
In her mind that was supported by the nearly systematic writing of a vertical sign at the end of each verse.,8,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"This sign, she assumed, could work like an end note, and could be used to indicate the main note (tonic) of a scale.",9,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
As she worked with each verse she became convinced that the notes of her transcription formed coherent melodies and not random sounds.,10,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
By comparing individual verses she then compiled tables of concordant sequences.,11,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"Analyzing the shapes of signs, she finally assigned conjectural values to the 8 sublinear signs of the prose system, suggesting that they are the 8 notes of a scale.",12,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
Some musicologists view as unlikely her hypothesis that the signs represent the degrees of a scale.,13,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
It is asserted that what seems to be her method is flawed.,14,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"(I.e., in the eyes of some critics, her method appears to assign the values of the signs arbitrarily, based only on a subjective assessment of the musical quality of the melody that a given assignment produces.)",15,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
"Nevertheless, her reconstruction of these notations allowed her to perform around the world the haunting, beautiful and spiritually uplifting music thus ""recovered"".",16,18,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
The work to pursue this conjectural decipherment and to justify its methodology and assumptions has been carried on since her death by her students and associates Gilles Tiar and John H. Wheeler (Johanan Rakkav on the net) who had some success in spreading her theories.,0,19,== Music of the Bible Revealed == | === Study ===,8687409
