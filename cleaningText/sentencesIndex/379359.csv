He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity.,6,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn—he felt that she occupied ""a higher spiritual role"" than he did.",7,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"He began identifying her as ""the Father"" and often referred to her with male pronouns.",8,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite began to emphasize a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as he needed the guidance of the Next Level.",9,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
Zeller notes that this naturally ensured no possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die.,10,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to see him as Christ.,11,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator.,12,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but in the 1980s the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.",13,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"After Nettles' death, Applewhite also altered his view of ascension; previously, he had taught that the group would physically ascend from the Earth and that death caused reincarnation, but her death—which left behind an unchanged, corporeal body—forced him to say that the ascension could be spiritual.",14,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
He then concluded that her spirit had traveled to a spaceship and received a new body and that  his followers and he would do the same.,15,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"In his view, the Biblical heaven was actually a planet on which highly evolved beings dwelt, and physical bodies were required to ascend there.",16,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite believed that once they reached the Next Level, they would facilitate evolution on other planets.",17,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"He emphasized that Jesus, whom he believed was an extraterrestrial, came to Earth, was killed, and bodily rose from the dead before being transported onto a spaceship.",18,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"According to Applewhite's doctrine, Jesus was a gateway to heaven, but had found humanity unready to ascend when he first came to the Earth.",19,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite then decided that an opportunity existed for humans to reach the Next Level ""every two millennia"", and the early 1990s would therefore provide the first opportunity to reach the Kingdom of Heaven since the time of Jesus.",20,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Zeller notes that his beliefs were based on the Christian Bible, but were interpreted through the lens of belief in alien contact with humanity.",21,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite taught that he was a walk-in, a concept that had gained popularity in the New Age movement during the late 1970s.",22,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
Walk-ins were said to be higher beings who took control of adult bodies to teach humanity.,23,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"This concept informed Applewhite's view of resurrection; he believed that his group's souls were to be transported to a spaceship, where they would enter other bodies.",24,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite abandoned the metaphor of a butterfly in favor of describing the body as a mere container, a vehicle that souls could enter and exit.",25,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"This dualism may have been the product of the Christology that Applewhite learned as a young man; Lewis writes that the group's teachings had ""Christian elements [that] were basically grafted on to a New Age matrix"".",26,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"In a profile of the group for Newsweek, Kenneth Woodward compares his dualism to that of ancient Christian Gnosticism, although Peters notes that his theology departs from Gnosticism by privileging the physical world.",27,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"In the wake of Nettles' death, Applewhite became increasingly paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group.",28,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators.",29,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of Masada in ancient Israel who showed total resistance to the Roman Empire.,30,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse, comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden that was to be recycled or rebooted and humanity to a failed experiment.",31,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be ""spaded under"".",32,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
Woodward notes that Applewhite's teaching about the Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism.,33,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"Applewhite also used New Age concepts, but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth.",34,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by Lucifer but that his followers could break free of this control.,35,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer.,36,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
"In addition, he stated that evil extraterrestrials, who he referred to as ""Luciferians"", sought to thwart his mission.",37,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of political correctness were actually Luciferians.,38,17,== Nettles' death ==,379359
