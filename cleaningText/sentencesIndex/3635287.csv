"Although he was expensive on true pitches Knox took 129 wickets for less than 22 runs each, and his promise was clearly noted, though even then the length (over 20 metres – very long for the time) of his run-up was seen as taking a great deal of energy out of him and it was thought Knox would have trouble coping with arduous seasons.",2,2,== Life and career ==,3635287

"These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey's last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox ""often played when he should have been resting"".",5,3,== Life and career ==,3635287
"Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered as perhaps the fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games: some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated.",6,3,== Life and career ==,3635287
