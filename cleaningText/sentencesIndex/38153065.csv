"His first task was to set up a system for creating custom loudspeaker designs for specific clients and purposes, and he performed much field work, tuning and optimizing loudspeaker installations.",1,7,== Eastern Acoustic Works ==,38153065
He then began to research the concept of phased point source behavior with the goal of controlling the directional characteristics of a high-powered concert loudspeaker cluster.,2,7,== Eastern Acoustic Works ==,38153065
This work led to the development of EAW's KF900 series concert touring system.,3,7,== Eastern Acoustic Works ==,38153065
"In 1997 he filed two patents related to this research: one for a downfill loudspeaker that would direct sound downward without being rigged differently than its upper neighbors, and a method for creating a ""common acoustical wavefront"" of horizontally arrayed loudspeaker horns mounted in trapezoid enclosures which placed the acoustic center of the array very close to the rear of the enclosure.",4,7,== Eastern Acoustic Works ==,38153065

"For years, Gunness had been looking for various electronic solutions to the undesirable characteristics of horns.",0,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"At EV in 1985, Gunness noticed the performance differences between various shapes of horns, and theorized that an electronic filter might allow optimization.",1,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"In early 1995, EV gained access to Altec Lansing's 1987 Acousta-CADD acoustic modeling software which revealed more loudspeaker performance characteristics than had previously been observed, but DSP programming tools were still inadequate for audio signal correction.",2,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"In 2000, Greek electroacousticians John Mourjopoulos and Panagiotis 'Panos' Hatziantoniou described a method for smoothing precise audio analysis filters.",3,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"Building on this work, Gunness led a team of EAW engineers to develop a proprietary wavelet transform spectrogram for internal research.",4,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
The EAW spectrogram reduced visual complexity by applying a zero-phase-shift low-pass filter to the audio signal under test using mirror-image infinite impulse response (IIR) filters.,5,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"The spectrogram revealed loudspeaker performance anomalies, allowing the engineering team to identify mechanisms they characterized as ""two-port systems""; i.e. mechanisms demonstrating a single input, a single transfer function, and a single output.",6,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
Such two-port systems were of interest because they could possibly be corrected with electronic filtering.,7,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"Because of their variability the methodology would not be used on any of the mechanisms which appeared to be non-linear relative to signal level, spatial distribution (""coverage""), or over time, such as cone stiffness or surround compliance.",8,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"This left several substantial ""linear, time-invariant"" (LTI) mechanisms that would yield to correction by digital filtering.",9,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"These included 1) time-smear from the compression driver/phase plug interface, 2) horn resonance, 3) cone resonance, and 4) crossover phase linearity between adjacent bandpasses.",10,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"In April 2005, EAW announced the NT Series, a line of 2-way bi-amplified self-powered loudspeakers incorporating the ""new technology"" which was initially called ""Digital Transduction Correction"" (DTC).",11,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"Mix magazine quoted Gunness identifying compression driver ""time smear"" as a longstanding loudspeaker problem that was countered by preconditioning in the audio signal.",12,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"Later that year, EAW dropped the DTC acronym and began promoting the technology as ""Gunness Focusing"".",13,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"At the AES convention in October 2005 in New York City, EAW project engineer William ""Bill"" Hoy and Gunness presented a paper describing the mathematics of the spectrogram.",14,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"At the same convention, Gunness spoke about the research and development which culminated in the new technology.",15,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
He described how the spectrogram allowed the EAW engineering team to observe the mechanism of time smear occurring in the small space between the compression driver diaphragm and the phase plug.,16,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"He discovered that only half of the compression driver's energy, at best, goes directly from the diaphragm through a phase plug slot or port and into the horn throat.",17,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
The rest of the sound waves either reflect back to the compression driver surface or travel to another phase plug slot or port; in both cases the result is wave energy leaving the phase plug after the initial impulse.,18,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
Gunness modeled this behavior mathematically and applied an inverted signal to cancel out the later wave energy.,19,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
Gunness filed a patent for the technology in March 2006.,20,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
"Later that year, EAW introduced the UX8800, a DSP-based loudspeaker management system with four inputs and eight outputs.",21,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065
The UX8800 was offered to allow Gunness Focusing to be applied to selected pre-existing EAW products such as the KF700 line array series.,22,9,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Gunness Focusing ===,38153065

Gunness joined with EAW co-founder Kenton Forsythe and engineer Jeff Rocha to design the KF760 and KF730 series line array systems.,0,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
The KF760 was a full-size 3-way system and the KF730 was a compact 3-way system.,1,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
Either system could be augmented with ground-stacked or flown subwoofers.,2,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"Common to the two different sizes of KF700 series products was the principal of ""divergence shading"" rather than the more usual intensity shading.",3,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
The vertical output pattern of the individual line array elements was adjusted to optimize SPL received by near- and far-field audience areas.,4,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
This method avoided what Gunness said was a discontinuity between adjacent loudspeaker enclosures driven at different signal levels; he observed smeared transients and frequency response problems.,5,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
Gunness wrote about divergence shading and general line array issues in August 2000.,6,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
The KF760 product was revealed in May 2001.,7,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"The major concerts using the KF760s included The Boston Globe's Jazz and Blues Festival in 2001, Usher's 2002 Evolution tour, Pearl Jam's 2003 Riot Act Tour, the North American dates of Iron Maiden's 2003 Give Me Ed... '",8,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065

"Usher also used flown KF761 boxes for his vocal stage monitoring system; monitor engineer Maceo Price and sound company owner Tim Cain sat down with Gunness and Rocha, looking at prediction software results to determine which EAW product line would best suit the purpose of loud monitors that would not be in the way of Usher's dancing and set changes.",10,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"By late 2006, the KF760 and KF730 line array products had been augmented with optional Gunness Focusing by way of the UX8800 loudspeaker management system.",11,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
THC Audio in Sofia used the UX8800/KF760 combination for Snoop Dogg's Bulgarian performance in 2008.,12,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"Gunness appeared as a panelist at an AES line array tutorial and workshop in October 2002, held in Los Angeles.",13,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"Don Keele, whose 1970s CD horn discoveries formed a basis for Gunness's later research, shared the panel.",14,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"In October 2003, Gunness wrote an article about ""Digitally Steerable Array"" (DSA) technology for Live Sound International magazine.",15,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
He expanded on the DSA concept the next month for the British Institute of Acoustics (IOA).,16,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"DSA allowed for adjustments to the vertical output width and vertical direction of a column of mid- to high-frequency loudspeaker drivers, in a frequency range from about 500 Hz to 16 kHz; a range critical to voice intelligibility.",17,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
Gunness wrote that his research into DSA began in the 1990s and was largely based on the observations gained in developing the KF900 series.,18,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"The proprietary FChart software was leveraged to create ""DSA Pilot"" to supply prediction and adjustment software for DSA installations.",19,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"DSA Pilot allowed the installer to change the vertical pattern of a DSA product from 15 to 120 degrees high, and to change the main direction up or down by 30 degrees, without changing the position of the enclosure.",20,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
Gunness told the IOA that each transducer in the vertical column must have its own DSP and amplifier for proper steering of the output pattern.,21,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"For high frequency control, physically small drivers are required.",22,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
One of the benefits of DSA was that the loudspeaker enclosure could be mounted flat against a vertical wall rather than tilted.,23,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"The flat position eliminated the problem of acoustic energy radiating from the back of the enclosure, smearing the forward output with multi-path arrival times.",24,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"In February 2000, Mackie Designs bought EAW but retained the EAW brand.",25,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"In 2003, Mackie Designs changed its name to LOUD Technologies and moved previously Seattle-based Mackie manufacturing to Asia.",26,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065
"In late 2006, LOUD moved EAW's loudspeaker production to China; the Massachusetts factory which had employed 100 assembly and woodshop workers was greatly reduced.",27,11,== Eastern Acoustic Works == | === Line arrays ===,38153065

Other negative aspects of traditional coaxial designs were their bulky weight and their lengthy axis requiring deep enclosures.,1,15,== Fulcrum Acoustic == | === Temporal Equalization ===,38153065
"Gunness and Siegel set about designing a coaxial with a common magnet for both low and high frequency drivers for weight savings and for reduced axial length, and a horn was developed to direct as much high frequency energy as possible away from the low frequency cone.",2,15,== Fulcrum Acoustic == | === Temporal Equalization ===,38153065
"A DSP solution called ""Temporal Equalization"" (TQ) was used to cancel out any remaining high frequency energy arriving at the moving cone.",3,15,== Fulcrum Acoustic == | === Temporal Equalization ===,38153065

"Gunness said that system designer John Lyons asked for a subwoofer that would ""crush"" at all locations on the dance floor.",1,16,== Fulcrum Acoustic == | === Temporal Equalization ===,38153065
Gunness responded by creating the US221 subwoofer with two 21-inch (530 mm) drivers.,2,16,== Fulcrum Acoustic == | === Temporal Equalization ===,38153065
"After hearing Haze's 130 dB SPL results, with a reported 10 dB of extra headroom because ten US221s were used, Lyons quipped that the system surpassed ""crush"" to establish ""punish"" as a benchmark.",3,16,== Fulcrum Acoustic == | === Temporal Equalization ===,38153065
