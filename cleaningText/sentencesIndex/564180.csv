"Kilbey has revealed that he and Richard Ploog often visited Sydney's Adyar Bookshop (bookshop of the Theosophical Society) during the 1980s to read books by occultist and mystical authors such as Helena Blavatsky, George Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky.",0,46,== Personal life == | === Spirituality ===,564180
"Likewise, spiritual mysticism is evident in the lyrics of songs as early as ""An Interlude"" with its line ""psychic angels spread on the top of her head"", and the song ""Tear It All Away"" whose lyrics are clearly about seeing beyond the mundane [1].",1,46,== Personal life == | === Spirituality ===,564180
"The song ""When You Were Mine"" on The Blurred Crusade is about past-life experience (""On a day like this, a hundred lifetimes ago..."").",2,46,== Personal life == | === Spirituality ===,564180
"""Myrrh"" from Heyday includes Christian imagery but seems to be as much about the nature of inner mystical experience: ""How can you be so invisible?/Give me the eyes to see/Privilege on privilege/An unwanted discovery""[2] The thread of spiritual exploration runs through many of Kilbey's lyrics to the present day, such as on more recent songs such as ""Invisible"" from 2002 (first appeared on After Everything Now This), with its refrain: ""All I ever wanted to see was just invisible to me.""",3,46,== Personal life == | === Spirituality ===,564180
"Kilbey's lyrics often quote historical and mythological events, and his interest in Eastern culture and religion frequently informs his music—this also applies to his painting (he often paints Hindu gods and goddesses).",0,47,== Personal life == | === Spirituality ===,564180
