Shepard began researching mechanisms of generalization while he was still a graduate student at Yale: I was now convinced that the problem of generalization was the most fundamental problem confronting learning theory.,0,5,== Research == | === Generalization and mental representation ===,2893969
"Because we never encounter exactly the same total situation twice, no theory of learning can be complete without a law governing how what is learned in one situation generalizes to another.",1,5,== Research == | === Generalization and mental representation ===,2893969
"Shepard and collaborators ""mapped"" large sets of stimuli using the rank order of likelihood that a person or organism would generalize the response to Stimulus A and give the same response to Stimulus B. To use an example from Shepard's 1987 paper proposing his ""Universal law of generalization"": will a bird ""generalize"" that it can eat a worm slightly different from a previous worm that it found was edible?Shepard used geometric and spatial metaphors to map a psychological space where ""distances"" between different stimuli were larger or smaller depending on whether the stimuli were, respectively, less or more similar.",0,6,== Research == | === Generalization and mental representation ===,2893969
"These imaginary distances are interesting because they permit mathematical inferences: the ""exponential decay"" in response to stimuli based on the distance holds valid for a wide range of experiments with human beings and with other organisms.",1,6,== Research == | === Generalization and mental representation ===,2893969

"He reports, ""This led to the development of the methods now known as nonmetric multidimensional scaling â€“ first by me (Shepard, 1962a, 1962b) and then, with improvements, by my Bell Labs mathematical colleague Joseph Kruskal (1964a, 1964b).""According to the American Psychological Association, ""nonmetric multidimensional scaling .. has provided the social sciences with a tool of enormous power for uncovering metric structures from ordinal data on similarities.""",1,8,== Research == | === Non-metric multidimensional scaling ===,2893969
"Awarding Shepard its Rumelhart Prize in 2006, the Cognitive Science Society called nonmetric multidimensional scaling a ""highly influential early contribution,"" explaining that:This method provided a new means of recovering the internal structure of mental representations from qualitative measures of similarity.",0,9,== Research == | === Non-metric multidimensional scaling ===,2893969

"The early experiments, in collaboration with Jacqueline Metzler, used perspective drawings of very abstract objects: ""ten solid cubes attached face-to-face to form a rigid armlike structure with exactly three right-angled 'elbows,'"" to quote their 1971 paper, the first report of this research.",0,12,== Research == | === Mental rotation ===,2893969
Shepard and Metzler were able to measure the speed with which subjects could imagine rotating these complicated objects.,1,12,== Research == | === Mental rotation ===,2893969

Shepard and Cooper also collaborated on a 1982 book (revised 1986) summarizing past work on mental rotation and other transformations of mental images.,3,12,== Research == | === Mental rotation ===,2893969
"Reviewing that work in 1983, Michael Kubovy assessed its importance:Up to that day in 1968 [Shepard's dream about rotating objects], mental transformations were no more accessible to psychological experimentation than were any other so-called private experiences.",0,13,== Research == | === Mental rotation ===,2893969
