He was elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1871 and Fellow of the Royal Society in 1890.,5,0,N/A,3568344
"Bosanquet developed classes for musical tunings used mapping pitches in a coordinate arrangement he called a generalized keyboard, contrasting with Henry Ward Poole's and Colin Brown's keyboards which were based on symmetry of key relationships.",6,0,N/A,3568344
"The keyboard was demonstrated in two instruments loaned permanently to the South Kensington Museum in 1876: a 41⁄2-octave harmonium tuned in 53 equal temperament with 84 keys per octave built by T. A. Jennings in 1872–3, and a 3-octave generalized keyboard organ built in 1875 with 48 notes per octave tuned to Hermann von Helmholtz' approximate just intonation (schismatic temperament) or 36 notes per octave tuned in quarter-comma meantone selected by means of draw stops.",7,0,N/A,3568344

"29–30, but this position did not acquire fame.",1,3,N/A,3568344
"The above position of Bosanquet, that a distinction should be made between ""well temperament"" and ""equal temperament"" was rediscovered by H. Kelletat, and thoroughly defended and analysed historically in ""Zur musikalischen Temperatur"", 1960, especially p. 32.",0,4,N/A,3568344
