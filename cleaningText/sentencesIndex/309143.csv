"After an in depth analysis of Skovoroda's language, G.

One of Skovoroda's missions was teaching.,0,29,== Teaching ==,309143
"Formally he taught poetics in the Pereyaslav Collegium (during 1750-1751) and poetics, syntax, Greek and catechism at Kharkov Collegium (also called Kharkiv Collegium and in Latin: Collegium Charkoviensis or Zacharpolis Collegium) (during 1759-1760, 1761-1764, 1768-1769).",1,29,== Teaching ==,309143
In 1751 he had a dispute with the presiding bishop of Pereyaslav Collegium who considered Skovoroda's new ways of teaching as strange and incompatible with the former traditional course of poetics.,2,29,== Teaching ==,309143
"Young Skovoroda, confident in his mastery of the subject matter and in the precision, clarity and comprehensiveness of his rules of prosody, refused to comply with the bishop's order, asking for arbitration and pointing out to him that ""alia res sceptrum, alia plectrum"" [the pastor's scepter is one thing, but the flute is another].",3,29,== Teaching ==,309143
The bishop considered Skovoroda's stance as arrogant and consequently he was dismissed.,4,29,== Teaching ==,309143
The first year of teaching at Kharkov Collegium passed brilliantly for Skovoroda.,5,29,== Teaching ==,309143
He not only excited his students with his lectures but his creative pedagogical approach also attracted the attention of his colleagues and even his superiors.,6,29,== Teaching ==,309143
"Skovoroda was also a private tutor for Vasily Tomara (1740—1813) (during 1753-1754, 1755-1758) and a mentor as well as a lifelong friend of Michael Kovalinsky (or Kovalensky, 1745—1807) (during 1761-1769), his biographer.",7,29,== Teaching ==,309143

"Due to Fyodor Vishnevsky Skovoroda has visited Central Europe, especially Hungary and Austria.",9,29,== Teaching ==,309143
In his teaching Skovoroda aimed at discovering the student's inclinations and abilities and devised talks and readings which would develop them to the fullest.,0,30,== Teaching ==,309143
This approach has been described by Skovoroda's biographer Kovalinsky:,1,30,== Teaching ==,309143
"""Skovoroda began [teaching young] Vasily Tomara by working more on the heart of his young disciple and, watching for his natural inclinations, he tried to help only the nature itself in developing him by engaging, light, and tender direction which the boy could not even notice, for Skovoroda paid particular attention not to overtax the young mind with [heavy] learning.",0,31,== Teaching ==,309143
In this way the boy became attached to Skovoroda with love [and trust for] him.,1,31,== Teaching ==,309143
"""His teaching was not limited to academia nor to private friends and during his later years as a ""wanderer"" he taught publicly the many who were drawn to him.",2,31,== Teaching ==,309143
"Archimandrite Gavriil (Vasily Voskresensky, 1795—1868), the first known historian of Russian philosophy, brilliantly described Skovoroda's Socratic qualities in teaching:",3,31,== Teaching ==,309143
"""Both Socrates and Skovoroda felt from above the calling to be tutors of the people, and, accepting the calling, they became public teachers in the personal and elevated meaning of that word.",0,32,== Teaching ==,309143
"… Skovoroda, also like Socrates, not being limited by time or place, taught on the crossroads, at markets, by a cemetery, under church porticoes, during holidays, when his sharp word would articulate an intoxicated will - and in the hard days of the harvest, when a rainless sweat poured upon the earth.",1,32,== Teaching ==,309143
"""Skovoroda taught that one finds his true calling by self-examination.",2,32,== Teaching ==,309143
"""Know yourself,"" advises Skovoroda using the well known maxim of the Greek philosopher Socrates.",3,32,== Teaching ==,309143
"He introduced a well founded idea that a person engaged in an in-born, natural work is provided with a truly satisfying and happy life.",4,32,== Teaching ==,309143
The education of young people occupied the attention of Skovoroda until his old age.,5,32,== Teaching ==,309143
"In 1787, seven years before his death, Skovoroda wrote two essays,  The Noble Stork (in Original: Благодарный Еродій, Blagorodnyj Erodiy) and The Poor Lark (in Original: Убогій Жаворонокъ, Ubogiy Zhavoronok), devoted to the theme of education where he expounded his ideas.",6,32,== Teaching ==,309143
