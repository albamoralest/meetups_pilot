Andrade explains their tangle of language in musical terms:,2,10,== The Week of Modern Art ==,2867405

"In 1922, while preparing Paulicéia Desvairada for publication, Andrade collaborated with Malfatti and Oswald de Andrade in creating a single event that would introduce their work to the wider public: the Semana de Arte Moderna (Week of Modern Art).",2,12,== The Week of Modern Art ==,2867405

"At the same time, Andrade was developing an extensive familiarity with the dialects and cultures of large parts of Brazil.",0,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
He started to apply to prose fiction the speech-patterned technique he had developed in writing the poems of Hallucinated city.,1,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"He wrote two novels during this period using these techniques: the first, Love, Intransitive Verb, was largely a formal experiment.; the second, written shortly after and published in 1928, was Macunaíma, a novel about a man (""The hero without a character"" is the subtitle of the novel) from an indigenous tribe who comes to São Paulo, learns its languages—both of them, the novel says: Portuguese and Brazilian—and returns.",2,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"The style of the novel is composite, mixing vivid descriptions of both jungle and city with abrupt turns toward fantasy, the style that would later be called magical realism.",3,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Linguistically, too, the novel is composite; as the rural hero comes into contact with his urban environment, the novel reflects the meeting of languages.",4,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Relying heavily on the primitivism that Andrade learned from the European modernists, the novel lingers over possible indigenous cannibalism even as it explores Macunaíma's immersion in urban life.",5,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
Critic Kimberle S. López has argued that cannibalism is the novel's driving thematic force: the eating of cultures by other cultures.,6,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Formally, Macunaíma is an ecstatic blend of dialects and of the urban and rural rhythms that Andrade was collecting in his research.",7,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"It contains an entirely new style of prose—deeply musical, frankly poetic, and full of gods and almost-gods, yet containing considerable narrative momentum.",8,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"At the same time, the novel as a whole is pessimistic.",9,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"It ends with Macunaíma's willful destruction of his own village; despite the euphoria of the collision, the meeting of cultures the novel documents is inevitably catastrophic.",10,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"As Severino João Albuquerque has demonstrated, the novel presents ""construction and destruction"" as inseparable.",11,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
It is a novel of both power (Macunaíma has all kinds of strange powers) and alienation.,12,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Even as Macunaíma changed the nature of Brazilian literature in an instant—Albuquerque calls it ""the cornerstone text of Brazilian Modernism""—the inner conflict in the novel was a strong part of its influence.",13,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Modernismo, as Andrade depicted it, was formally tied to the innovations of recent European literature and based on the productive meeting of cultural forces in Brazil's diverse population; but it was fiercely nationalistic, based in large part on distinguishing Brazil's culture from the world and on documenting the damage caused by the lingering effects of colonial rule.",14,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"At the same time, the complex inner life of its hero suggests themes little explored in earlier Brazilian literature, which critics have taken to refer back to Andrade himself.",15,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"While Macunaíma is not autobiographical in the strict sense, it clearly reflects and refracts Andrade's own life.",16,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
Andrade was a mulatto; his parents were landowners but were in no sense a part of Brazil's Portuguese pseudo-aristocracy.,17,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
Some critics have paralleled Andrade's race and family background to the interaction between categories of his character Macunaíma.,18,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Macunaíma's body itself is a composite: his skin is darker than that of his fellow tribesmen, and at one point in the novel, he has an adult's body and a child's head.",19,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"He himself is a wanderer, never belonging to any one place.",20,19,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
Other critics have argued for similar analogues between Andrade's sexuality and Macunaíma's complex status.,0,20,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Though Andrade was not openly gay, and there is no direct evidence of his sexual practices, many of Andrade's friends have reported after his death that he was clearly interested in men (the subject is only reluctantly discussed in Brazil).",1,20,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
It was over a pseudonymous accusation of effeminacy that Andrade broke with Oswald de Andrade in 1929.,2,20,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Macunaíma prefers women, but his constant state of belonging and not belonging is associated with sex.",3,20,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"The character is sexually precocious, starting his romantic adventures at the age of six, and his particular form of eroticism seems always to lead to destruction of one kind or another.",4,20,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Inevitably, Macunaíma's polemicism and sheer strangeness have become less obvious as it has grown ensconced in mainstream Brazilian culture and education.",0,21,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"Once regarded by academic critics as an awkwardly constructed work of more historical than literary importance, the novel has come to be recognized as a modernist masterpiece whose difficulties are part of its aesthetic.",1,21,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
Andrade is a national cultural icon; his face has appeared on the Brazilian currency.,2,21,== Macunaíma ==,2867405
"A film of Macunaíma was made in 1969, by Brazilian director Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, updating Andrade's story to the 1960s and shifting it to Rio de Janeiro; the film was rereleased internationally in 2009.",3,21,== Macunaíma ==,2867405

"He was able to remain at the Conservatory, where he was now Chair of History of Music and Aesthetics.",1,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405

"He continued to document rural folk music, and during the 1930s made an enormous collection of recordings of the songs and other forms of music of the interior.",3,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405

"He is credited with coining the word ""popularesque,"" which he defined as imitations of Brazilian folk music by erudite urban musicians (""erudite"" is generally a deprecation in Andrade's vocabulary).",6,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
The word continues to have currency in discussion of Brazilian music as both a scholarly and nationalist category.,7,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"In 1935, during an unstable period in Vargas's government, Andrade and writer and archaeologist Paulo Duarte, who had for many years desired to promote cultural research and activity in the city through a municipal agency, were able to create a unified São Paulo Department of Culture (Departamento de Cultura e Recreação da Prefeitura Municipal de São Paulo).",8,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
Andrade was named founding director.,9,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"The Department of Culture had a broad purview, overseeing cultural and demographic research, the construction of parks and playgrounds, and a considerable publishing wing.",10,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Andrade approached the position with characteristic ambition, using it to expand his work in folklore and folk music while organizing myriad performances, lectures, and expositions.",11,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"He moved his collection of recordings to the Department, and expanding and enhancing it became one of the Department's chief functions, overseen by Andrade's former student, Oneyda Alvarenga.",12,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405

He attempted to pull together his research into a general theory.,15,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Concerned as always with Modernismo's need to break from the past, he formulated a distinction between the classical music of 18th- and 19th-century Europe, and what he called the music of the future, which would be based simultaneously on modernist breakdowns of musical form and on an understanding of folk and popular music.",16,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"The music of the past, he said, was conceived in terms of space: whether counterpoint, with its multiple voices arranged in vertical alignment, or the symphonic forms, in which the dominant voice is typically projected on top of a complex accompaniment.",17,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Future music would be arranged in time rather than space: ""moment by moment"" (in Luper's translation).",18,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"This temporal music would be inspired not by ""contemplative remembrance"", but by the deep longing or desire expressed by the Portuguese word saudade.",19,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Through his position at the Department of Culture in this period, he was able to assist Dina Lévi-Strauss and her husband, Claude Lévi-Strauss with films they were making based on field research in Mato Grosso and Rondônia.",20,23,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Andrade's position at the Department of Culture was abruptly revoked in 1937, when Vargas returned to power and Duarte was exiled.",0,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
In 1938 Andrade moved to Rio de Janeiro to take up a post at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.,1,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"While there he directed the Congresso da Língua Nacional Cantada (Congress of National Musical Language), a major folklore and folk music conference.",2,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"He returned to São Paulo in 1941, where he worked on a collected edition of his poetry.",3,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Andrade's final project was a long poem called ""Meditação Sôbre o Tietê.""",4,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"The work is dense and difficult, and was dismissed by its early critics as ""without meaning"", although recent work on it has been more enthusiastic.",5,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"One critic, David T Haberly, has compared it favorably to William Carlos Williams's Paterson, a dense but influential unfinished epic using composite construction.",6,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"Like Paterson, it is a poem about a city; the ""Meditação"" is centered on the Tietê River, which flows through São Paulo.",7,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"The poem is simultaneously a summation of Andrade's career, commenting on poems written long before, and a love poem addressed to the river and to the city itself.",8,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"In both cases, the poem hints at a larger context: it compares the river to the Tagus in Lisbon and the Seine in Paris, as if claiming an international position for Andrade as well.",9,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
"At the same time, the poem associates both Andrade's voice and the river with ""banzeiro,"" a word from the Afro-Brazilian musical tradition: music that can unite man and river.",10,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
The poem is the definitive and final statement of Andrade's ambition and his nationalism.,11,24,== Late life and musical research ==,2867405
