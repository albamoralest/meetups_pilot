"Burnside had a powerful, expressive voice, that did not fail with old age but rather grew richer, and played both electric and acoustic guitar, with and without a slide.",0,34,== Style ==,795894
His drone-heavy style was more characteristic of North Mississippi hill country blues than Delta blues.,1,34,== Style ==,795894
"Like other country blues musicians, he did not always adhere to strict 12- or 16-bar blues patterns, often adding extra beats to a measure as he saw fit.",2,34,== Style ==,795894
His rhythms are often based on the fife and drum blues of north Mississippi.,3,34,== Style ==,795894
"As was the case with his role model John Lee Hooker, Burnside's earliest recordings sound quite similar to one another, even repetitive, in vocal and instrumental styling.",4,34,== Style ==,795894
Many of these songs eschew traditional chord changes in favor of a single chord or a simple bassline pattern that repeats throughout.,5,34,== Style ==,795894
Burnside played the guitar fingerstyle—without a pick—and often in open-G tuning.,6,34,== Style ==,795894
"His vocal style is characterized by a tendency to ""break"" briefly into falsetto, usually at the end of long notes.",7,34,== Style ==,795894
"Like his contemporary T-Model Ford, Burnside favored a stripped-down approach to the blues, marked by a quality of rawness.",0,35,== Style ==,795894
"He and his later managers and reviewers maintained his persona as a hard-working man leading a life of struggle, a heavy drinker, latent criminal singing songs of swagger and rebellion.",1,35,== Style ==,795894
"Burnside knew many toasts—African American narrative folk poems such as ""Signifying monkey"" and ""Tojo Told Hitler""—and fondly recited them between songs at his concerts and on recordings.",0,36,== Style ==,795894
"He narrated long jokes in concerts and social events, and many sources noted his quick wit and charisma.",1,36,== Style ==,795894
