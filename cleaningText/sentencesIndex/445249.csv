"At first, jazz was heard in film soundtracks only when a jazz-band performance was an element of the story.",0,20,== Film and television ==,445249
"Early in his career, Manne was occasionally seen and heard in the movies, for example in the 1942 film Seven Days Leave, as the drummer in the highly popular Les Brown orchestra (soon to be known as ""Les Brown and His Band of Renown"").",1,20,== Film and television ==,445249
"In the 1950s, however, jazz began to be used for all or parts of film soundtracks, and Manne pioneered in these efforts, beginning with The Wild One (1953).",0,21,== Film and television ==,445249
"As jazz quickly assumed a major role in the musical background of films, so did Manne assume a major role as a drummer and percussionist on those soundtracks.",1,21,== Film and television ==,445249
A notable early example was 1955's The Man with the Golden Arm; Manne not only played drums throughout but functioned as a personal assistant to director Otto Preminger and tutored star Frank Sinatra.,2,21,== Film and television ==,445249
"The Decca soundtrack LP credits him prominently for the ""Drumming Sequences"".",3,21,== Film and television ==,445249

"Soon, Manne began to contribute to film music in a broader way, often combining jazz, pop, and classical music.",3,22,== Film and television ==,445249
"Henry Mancini in particular found plenty of work for him; the two shared an interest in experimenting with tone colors, and Mancini came to rely on Manne to shape the percussive effects in his music.",4,22,== Film and television ==,445249

"Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that he was using him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 1959–1960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 1959–1962), and the film version of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).",1,23,== Film and television ==,445249
"In the late 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, such as that for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP.",0,24,== Film and television ==,445249
"In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and sometimes writing complete scores for both film and television.",1,24,== Film and television ==,445249
He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons.,2,24,== Film and television ==,445249
"For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (1969–1971).",3,24,== Film and television ==,445249
"Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 1966–1969.",4,24,== Film and television ==,445249
"With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into the popular culture of several decades.",5,24,== Film and television ==,445249
(Some unspecified quantity of the original material was later lost to history.,6,24,== Film and television ==,445249

"A star in Stan Kenton's famous orchestra in the 1940s and 1950s, as well as that of Woody Herman, also in the 1940s, and winner of numerous awards, Manne slipped from public view as jazz became less central in popular music.",0,26,== Later career ==,445249
"In the 1960s and early 1970s, however, he helped keep jazz alive on the Los Angeles scene as part owner of the nightclub Shelly's Manne-Hole on North Cahuenga Boulevard.",1,26,== Later career ==,445249
"There, the house band was Shelly Manne and His Men, which featured some of his favorite sidemen, such as Russ Freeman, Monty Budwig, Richie Kamuca, Conte Candoli, and later Frank Strozier, John Morell, and Mike Wofford, among many other notable West Coast jazz musicians.",2,26,== Later career ==,445249
"Also appearing at the club was a roster of jazz stars from different eras and all regions, including Ben Webster, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Les McCann, Bill Evans, John Coltrane, Sonny Stitt, Thelonious Monk, Michel Legrand, Carmen McRae, Milt Jackson, Teddy Edwards, Monty Alexander, Lenny Breau, Miles Davis, and many, many others.",3,26,== Later career ==,445249

"From that point, Manne refocused his attention on his own drumming.",5,26,== Later career ==,445249
"It might be argued that he never played with more taste, refinement, and soulful swing than in the 1970s, when he recorded numerous albums with musicians like trumpeter Red Rodney, pianist Hank Jones, saxophonists Art Pepper and Lew Tabackin, and composer-arranger-saxophonist Oliver Nelson.",6,26,== Later career ==,445249
"From 1974 to 1977 he joined guitarist Laurindo Almeida, saxophonist and flutist Bud Shank, and bassist Ray Brown to perform as the group The L.A. Four, which recorded four albums before Manne left the ensemble.",7,26,== Later career ==,445249
"In the 1980s, Manne recorded with such stars as trumpeter Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, saxophonist Zoot Sims, guitarists Joe Pass and Herb Ellis, and pianist John Lewis (famous as the musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet).",0,27,== Later career ==,445249
"Meanwhile, he continued to record with various small groups of his own.",0,28,== Later career ==,445249

"With their enthusiasm and spontaneity, and the sense that the audience in the intimate ambience of the club is participating in the music, these performances share the characteristics that had been celebrated more than two decades before in the better-known Black Hawk performances.",2,28,== Later career ==,445249
"Although this phase of his career has frequently been overlooked, Manne, by this time, had greatly refined his ability to back other musicians sympathetically, yet make his own musical thoughts clearly heard.",3,28,== Later career ==,445249
Manne's heavy load of Hollywood studio work sometimes shifted his attention from his mainstream jazz playing.,4,28,== Later career ==,445249
"Even in lackluster films, however, he nevertheless often succeeded in making art of what might be called hackwork.",5,28,== Later career ==,445249
"Still, for all his tireless work in the studios, Manne's labor of love was his contribution to jazz as an American art form, to which he had dedicated himself since his youth and continued to work at almost to the last day of his life.",6,28,== Later career ==,445249
Manne died somewhat before the popular revival of interest in jazz had gained momentum.,7,28,== Later career ==,445249
"But in his last few years, his immense contribution to the music regained at least some local recognition, and the role Manne had played in the culture of his adopted city began to draw public appreciation.",8,28,== Later career ==,445249
"Two weeks before his sudden death of a heart attack, he was honored by the City of Los Angeles in conjunction with the Hollywood Arts Council when September 9, 1984 was declared ""Shelly Manne Day"".",9,28,== Later career ==,445249
