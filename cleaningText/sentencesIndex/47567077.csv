"Musically, they moved hip hop and rap music away from the funk and disco-oriented sound of its beginnings, into an altogether new and unique sonic imprint.",1,30,== Legacy ==,47567077
"Their sound is directly responsible for intentionally transforming rap music from dance-and club-oriented funk grooves like ""Rapper's Delight"" and ""The Breaks"" to an aggressive, less-danceable approach.",2,30,== Legacy ==,47567077
"Characterized by sparse, hard-hitting beats—as typified on hits like ""It's Like That"", and ""Peter Piper""—this would form the foundation of hardcore hip hop (particularly hardcore East Coast hip hop).",3,30,== Legacy ==,47567077
