By the turn of the 20th century new innovations in the art of classical dance began to become apparent.,0,65,"== St. Petersburg, Russia == | === Final years with the Imperial Ballet ===",1709914
"With all of this, Petipa's rocky relationship with the new director of the Imperial Theatres, Vladimir Telyakovsky, appointed to the position in 1901, served as a catalyst to the Ballet Master's end.",1,65,"== St. Petersburg, Russia == | === Final years with the Imperial Ballet ===",1709914

"One example of Telyakovsky's efforts in his attempt to ""de-throne"" Petipa came in 1902 when he invited Alexander Gorsky, former premier danseur to the Imperial Ballet, to stage his own version of Petipa's 1869 ballet Don Quixote.",0,66,"== St. Petersburg, Russia == | === Final years with the Imperial Ballet ===",1709914
