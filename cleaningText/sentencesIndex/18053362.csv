"The panidas were influenced by the modernist movement in literature, which in Latin America became known as modernismo .",1,9,== As a poet ==,18053362
"This movement aimed to reclaim the already established European standards of art and literature and give it a modern and local character; the panidas thus became the precursors of modernism in Colombia, transforming the foreign and strange into local and tangent.",2,9,== As a poet ==,18053362
"De Greiff often exposed Colombian audiences this way, for example to the mystic land of Vikings and fjords by giving it a familiar antioqueño feel, a combination of the two worlds that were part of de Greiff’s life He also became known for his eclectic use of the language often using a lexicon so unfamiliar to most Spanish speaking audiences of that time that it would sound as if it were a foreign language, and introduced references to obscure or unknown authors and works of art and literature that were not part of standard curricula.",3,9,== As a poet ==,18053362
"Also present in de Greiff’s and the panida’s work was the influence of symbolism, and more significant that of parnassiastic thought, of creating poetry in its purest form to more closely resemble art.",4,9,== As a poet ==,18053362
De Greiff described the purpose of the panidas in these words:,5,9,== As a poet ==,18053362
"We were encouraged, above all, by a purpose of renewal.",0,10,== As a poet ==,18053362

"De Greiff had its works published for the first time in this magazine under the nom de plume Leo le Gris, the first one being his Ballad of the Mad Owls.",2,11,== As a poet ==,18053362
No sooner had the magazine been published than the Roman Catholic Church in Colombia banned for fear of corrupting the youth with its pernicious and extravagant content.,0,12,== As a poet ==,18053362
"The public reception was not welcoming either, the writing style of de Greiff and the other panidas was at the vanguard of its time, but too far-off from what mundane Colombian society was familiar with.",1,12,== As a poet ==,18053362
It did however earn the praise and support of prominent Medellín literati such as writer Tomás Carrasquilla and journalist Fidel Cano Gutiérrez.,2,12,== As a poet ==,18053362

"Los Nuevos was of political, artistic, literary and social content, and aimed to challenge the remnants of exhausted romanticist writings, regionalist politics, and conservative society.",2,15,== As a poet == | === Los Nuevos ===,18053362
This movement followed the path that the panidas had begun in Medellín and that was a representation of modernismo in Colombia much like the ultraist movement in Spain.,3,15,== As a poet == | === Los Nuevos ===,18053362
