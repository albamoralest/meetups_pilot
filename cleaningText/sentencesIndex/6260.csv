"Among French predecessors, Chabrier was an important influence on Debussy (as he was on Ravel and Poulenc); Howat has written that Chabrier's piano music such as ""Sous-bois"" and ""Mauresque"" in the Pièces pittoresques explored new sound-worlds of which Debussy made effective use 30 years later.",0,39,== Influences == | === Musical ===,6260
"Lesure finds traces of Gounod and Massenet in some of Debussy's early songs, and remarks that it may have been from the Russians – Tchaikovsky, Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky – that Debussy acquired his taste for ""ancient and oriental modes and for vivid colorations, and a certain disdain for academic rules"".",1,39,== Influences == | === Musical ===,6260

Howat cautions against the assumption that Debussy's Ballade (1891) and Nocturne (1892) are influenced by Chopin – in Howat's view they owe more to Debussy's early Russian models – but Chopin's influence is found in other early works such as the Two arabesques (1889–1891).,7,39,== Influences == | === Musical ===,6260
