"In 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decided that Denver could no longer fly a plane, owing to medical disqualification for failure to abstain from alcohol, a condition that the FAA had imposed in October 1995 after his prior drunk-driving conviction.",22,25,== Personal life ==,58586

Death ==,1,26,== Death ==,58586
"Denver died on the afternoon of October 12, 1997, when his light homebuilt aircraft, a Rutan Long-EZ with registration number N555JD, crashed into Monterey Bay near Pacific Grove, California, while making a series of touch-and-go landings at the nearby Monterey Peninsula Airport.",0,27,== Death ==,58586
He was the plane's only occupant.,1,27,== Death ==,58586
The official cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma resulting from the crash.,2,27,== Death ==,58586
"Denver was a pilot with over 2,700 hours of experience.",0,28,== Death ==,58586
"He had pilot ratings for single-engine land and sea, multi-engine land, glider and instrument.",1,28,== Death ==,58586
He also held a type rating in his Learjet.,2,28,== Death ==,58586
"He had recently purchased the Long-EZ aircraft, made by someone else from a kit, and had taken a half-hour checkout flight with the aircraft the day before his accident.",3,28,== Death ==,58586
Denver was not legally permitted to fly at the time of the crash.,4,28,== Death ==,58586
"In previous years, he had several arrests for drunk driving.",5,28,== Death ==,58586
"In 1996, nearly a year before the accident, the FAA learned that Denver had failed to maintain sobriety by not refraining entirely from alcohol and revoked his medical certification.",6,28,== Death ==,58586
The accident was not influenced by alcohol use; an autopsy found no sign of alcohol or other drugs in Denver's body.,7,28,== Death ==,58586
Post-accident investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) showed that the leading cause of the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight.,8,28,== Death ==,58586
The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight.,9,28,== Death ==,58586
His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration.,10,28,== Death ==,58586
The handle had originally been intended by the plane's designer to be between the pilot's legs.,11,28,== Death ==,58586
The builder instead put it behind the pilot's left shoulder.,12,28,== Death ==,58586
The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and was not visible to the person at the controls.,13,28,== Death ==,58586
An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.,14,28,== Death ==,58586
"Before the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of Vise-Grip pliers, but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat.",15,28,== Death ==,58586
"NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valves' positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve.",16,28,== Death ==,58586
"This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (nose right) and pitch up.",17,28,== Death ==,58586
The mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant.,18,28,== Death ==,58586
Denver had asked how much fuel was shown.,19,28,== Death ==,58586
"He told Denver that there was ""less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank"".",20,28,== Death ==,58586
He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges.,21,28,== Death ==,58586
The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage.,22,28,== Death ==,58586
Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve.,23,28,== Death ==,58586
"He turned down an offer to refuel, saying that he would be flying for about an hour.",24,28,== Death ==,58586
The NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight.,25,28,== Death ==,58586
Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.,26,28,== Death ==,58586
Four said the aircraft was originally heading west.,27,28,== Death ==,58586
"Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north).",28,28,== Death ==,58586
Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent.,29,28,== Death ==,58586
Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude between 350 and 500 feet (110 and 150 m) when heading toward the shoreline.,30,28,== Death ==,58586
"Eight said they heard a ""pop"" or ""backfire"" accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.",31,28,== Death ==,58586
"In addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident.",0,29,== Death ==,58586
Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place.,1,29,== Death ==,58586
The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft.,2,29,== Death ==,58586
