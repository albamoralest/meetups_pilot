"The album, which was recorded at the ORF RadioKulturhaus in Vienna, was released in November 2015.",1,65,== Albums ==,19657740
"The compositional style of the works on this recording varies in terms of their musical substance and behaviour, expressing the composer's distinctive musical values: his breadth of vision, technical craft, rhythmic drive, movement and gesture, and his profound expressivity and meta-theatricality, which have a spirit of restlessness and unexpectedness – often achieved through compositional techniques invented by Elia himself.",2,65,== Albums ==,19657740
