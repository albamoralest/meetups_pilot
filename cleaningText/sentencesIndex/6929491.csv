"He insisted that ""musical talent is subject to scientific analysis and can be measured.""",1,11,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491

Tonal memory: Hearing a series of tones twice with the second playing having an adjusted note and identifying which note was changed.,0,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
"Additional subtests were incorporated to measure other features of musical perception, including timbre, rhythm, musical memory, and emotional reactions and self-expressions in music.",1,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
"Teachers would also add qualitative information through ratings of brightness (estimate of the natural ability to do the work that the school requires under favorable conditions), singing (ability to sing as shown in public school music), and rhythmic action (child's ability to march, to skip, to dance, or take part in games requiring motor coordination).",2,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
"Given the results of the battery, Seashore created a Talent Chart based on norms and percentile rank values for children in the fifth grade and eighth grade as well as adults.",3,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
Each test would be normed and given a percentage value; the results would then be shown in a single graph or curve and would help convey an immediate representation of the features of musical traits or capacities of a specific individual.,4,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
The results in the inventory may serve to highlight areas of weaknesses and difficulty in music perception and training.,5,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
Another aim of the battery was to identify musically talented students and to encourage them to pursue music.,6,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
"The inventory also serves to objectify the elements of musical appreciation and to shape the science, psychology, and art of music.",7,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
"The Seashore Tests of Musical Ability may also be implemented in elementary schools and used in group tests to identify gifted and talented musical individuals, to serve as a screening test for admissions into music-based schools, to pinpoint musical weaknesses, and to devise appropriate musical exercises in classroom settings.",8,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491
"As Seashore's battery help predict relative successes and failures of elementary school students, he also created suitable instruments, such as a tonoscope to help identify the intonation of pitch and a rhythm meter to practice the synchronization of different rhythmic patterns, to allow students to practice and improve on areas of perceptual difficulties and musical training.",9,23,== Seashore Tests of Musical Ability ==,6929491

"The test booklet consisted of 125 pairs of pictures, each being an image and the same image altered ""to lower its artistic existence"".",0,26,== Meier-Seashore Art Judgment Test ==,6929491
