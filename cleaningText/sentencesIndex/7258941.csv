"""Hilly Fields"" was recorded at Heath Levy's own small studio and at Alvic Studios in west London, and again featured Jeff Leach on keyboards, along with Ian Pearce on drums, Rickman Godlee on cello, and ""Kate"" on additional vocals—for many years the rumour was that ""Kate"" was actually Kate Bush, but in 2010 Nicely explained that ""I was always tied to Kate [Bush] with this rumor that she was on 'Hilly Fields'...",3,8,"== Early 1980s singles == | === ""Hilly Fields (1892)"" ===",7258941
