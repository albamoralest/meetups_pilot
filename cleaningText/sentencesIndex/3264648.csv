"McKenna's musical style relied on two key elements relating to his choices of tunes and set selection, and the method of playing that has come to be known as ""three-handed swing"".",0,6,== Musical style ==,3264648
"His renditions usually began with a spare, open statement of the melody; or, on ballads, a freely played, richly harmonized one.",0,7,== Musical style ==,3264648
"He then often stated the theme a second time, gradually bringing in more harmony or a stronger pulse.",1,7,== Musical style ==,3264648
"His improvisation then began in earnest on three simultaneous levels: a walking bassline, mid-range chords, and an improvised melody.",0,8,== Musical style ==,3264648
"The bassline, for which McKenna frequently employed the rarely used lowest regions of the piano, was often played non-legato to simulate a double bassist's phrasing.",1,8,== Musical style ==,3264648
"The chords were played with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand or of both hands combined, if the bass was not too low to make the stretch unfeasible.",2,8,== Musical style ==,3264648
"Sometimes he also added a guide-tone line consisting of thirds and sevenths on top of the bass, played by the thumb of the left hand.",3,8,== Musical style ==,3264648
"With his right hand's remaining fingers, he then played the melody, weaving it into improvised lines featuring colorful chromaticism, blues licks and mainstream-jazz ideas.",4,8,== Musical style ==,3264648
The result was the sound of a three-piece band under one person's creative control.,5,8,== Musical style ==,3264648
"McKenna often used his left hand to emulate the sound of a rhythm jazz guitarist, playing a four-to-the-bar ""strum"" consisting of a bass note (root/fifth/other interval), third and seventh.",0,9,== Musical style ==,3264648
"This pattern often took the form of intervals of a tenth, which is why the voicings were frequently ""broken"" arpeggiated, with the top two notes being played on the beat and the bass note slightly before.",1,9,== Musical style ==,3264648
He often subtly altered these voicings every two beats for variety.,2,9,== Musical style ==,3264648
"His ""broken tenth"" sound was frequently mistaken for stride piano.",0,10,== Musical style ==,3264648
"However, it was a more modern four-beat style, as opposed to stride's two-beat ""oom-pah"" rhythm (a la Fats Waller).",1,10,== Musical style ==,3264648
"McKenna was also quite capable of playing full stride piano, and occasionally broke into stride choruses, especially on songs associated with traditional jazz or at the height of an up-tempo song's development.",2,10,== Musical style ==,3264648
The characteristic that perhaps most distinguishes McKenna's playing is his sense of time.,0,11,== Musical style ==,3264648
"One of the biggest challenges of solo jazz piano is the need to provide a compelling time feel, in part by emulating the rhythmic landscape normally provided by three or four players in a small group.",1,11,== Musical style ==,3264648
"By conceiving multiple ""parts"" and playing them with distinct volume levels and time feels (often with right hand chords ahead of the beat and the melody behind the beat), McKenna had a unique ability to reproduce, on his own, the sound of a small group.",2,11,== Musical style ==,3264648
McKenna liked to create medleys around a common word or theme in song titles.,0,12,== Musical style ==,3264648
"He often combined ballads and up-tempo songs with standards, pop tunes, blues, and TV themes and folk songs.",1,12,== Musical style ==,3264648
