"The predominance of sequencing can also be found in the follow-up live album Dziękuję Poland Live '83, although many of its tracks are re-workings of those to be found on Audentity.",4,7,== History == | === 1980s ===,189048
"Schulze's next studio-based album Angst (soundtrack to the namesake 1983 film) moved away from the harshness of the sharp, heavily sequenced style of the three previous albums and, once again, had the more ""organic feel"" of earlier recordings.",5,7,== History == | === 1980s ===,189048

"Starting with Beyond Recall, the first half of the 1990s was his ""sample"" period, when Schulze used a wide variety of prerecorded sounds such as screeching birds and sensuous female moans in his studio albums and live performances.",0,9,== History == | === 1990s ===,189048
