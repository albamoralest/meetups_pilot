The stage environment and the physical lay-out of the venue are important parts of his work and some of his compositions (e.g. Sculpture de Muses in 2012) have been designed for specific locations.,1,11,== Style ==,39210454
"His experience as a jazz musician has led him to develop a technique of ‘improvised composition’ in which the written work is subjected to changes in real-time during the course of a concert, allowing for greater spontaneity of performance.",2,11,== Style ==,39210454
This may be driven by purely aural considerations but also by a concern for how the playing of the piano as a visual performance is perceived.,3,11,== Style ==,39210454
"Having studied at the Beaux-Arts, I quickly noticed that I painted music and played sculpture — Patrick Defossez",0,12,== Style ==,39210454

"On several occasions he has performed his music in conjunction with visual elements: paintings (Fondation Carzou) or animated works (soundtrack to a silent film), envisioning the concert to be a movement, an imbalance, a meandering, a journey, as much in the physical as in the temporal sense, one that also occurs in our mind’s eye.",1,13,== Style ==,39210454
"In the same way that his music has a transversal quality, Patrick Defossez’s lyrics and the names of many of his compositions frequently display great inventiveness and something of his flamboyant, irreverent side.",0,14,== Style ==,39210454
This helps us to understand the process of the working and re-working of raw materials  from which new performance gestures are born.,1,14,== Style ==,39210454
"The works of Raymond Queneau (Injectertion) and Allen Ginsberg (Libr’Air) fit naturally into this vein, but other writers who might not have been immediately associated with this environment such as Henry de Montherlant (Inès de Castro), Louis Aragon (La messe noire d’Elsa) and Jean Genet (Le funambule) have also been ‘set to music’ by Patrick Defossez.",2,14,== Style ==,39210454
"Patrick Defossez accords much importance to the crafting of instruments and to the performance gesture, so much so that he has explored the idea of a ‘digital conservatory’ of instrumental techniques.",0,15,== Style ==,39210454
"He readily uses rare and unusual instruments in his compositions: the bass oboe, a didgeridoo,  ondes Martenot, the bass flute, the double bell euphonium, the electroacoustic harp, sound-producing sculptures like the namureauphones, traditional Basque instruments etc.",1,15,== Style ==,39210454

"These ‘meslanges’ are frequently joyful, blending both style and musical timbre, creating two distinct families of works, one of which tends towards the heterogeneous and the incongruous (perhaps drawing on the Belgian surrealist heritage?), while the other is an exploration of the performance gesture and the essence of musical time.",0,16,== Style ==,39210454
