"Giant Robot magazine called Viewfinder ""a great album combining some of the best in music"", going on to list the band's members, detailing their respective pedigrees, as did Jean-Baptiste Dupin writing for Les Inrockuptibles, describing Pullman ""[a]s a land of suburbs, a small garden on the outskirts humbly handset by eight green hands"".",2,7,== Critical reception ==,39158402
