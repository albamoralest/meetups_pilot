"Whilst performing at a gig at the Fulham Arts Centre he was talent-spotted by the punk-rocker Billy Idol, who was at that time looking for a guitar player to complete the line-up of a new band that he had just formed that would be named Generation X. Andrews was recruited to be its lead guitarist, in the process freeing Idol from the band's guitar role to become its frontman/singer.",1,4,== Generation X ==,28426829
"Andrews was subsequently christened with the punk pseudonym ""Derwood"" by the band, a name invented on the spur of the moment by a friend of his whilst under interrogation from Tony James, the band's strategist, about school nicknames that Andrews had in search of a punk stage-name, to avoid James discovering and using the name ""Dobbin"", which Andrews' prominent front teeth in his school years had attracted.",2,4,== Generation X ==,28426829

"After two propitious opening years, with a hectic touring schedule and record releases entering the charts, the release of the Valley of the Dolls LP at the start of 1979, although being marked simultaneously by their highest chart hit with the single ""King Rocker"" (No. 11 in the UK Singles Chart), initiated the beginning of a deterioration in the commercial success of the band, and differences began to surface within it between Andrews and Billy Idol and the bass player Tony James as to its future musical direction.",6,4,== Generation X ==,28426829
"The disagreement about direction was augmented by Idol and James' refusal to allow Andrews to contribute to their songwriting partnership, and an increasing personal antipathy that had developed in Andrews towards Idol.",7,4,== Generation X ==,28426829
"In May 1979, Andrews warned them that he was increasingly feeling like leaving Generation X, which was avoided by focusing on the band's first international tour in Japan mid-year, but on returning to England, during the recording sessions for the band's abortive third album (which would be released retrospectively 20 years later, by Andrews in the face of opposition from Idol, under the title K.M.D. – Sweet Revenge) internal disputes came to a head, and Andrews quit the band just before Christmas.",8,4,== Generation X ==,28426829
