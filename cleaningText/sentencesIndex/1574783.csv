"A great deal of Brown's work is composed in fixed modules (though often with idiosyncratic mixtures of notation), but the order is left free to be chosen by the conductor during performance.",0,8,== Open form ==,1574783

"In 1959, with Hodograph I, Brown sketched the contour and character abstractly in what he called ""implicit areas"" of the piece.",0,14,== Notation ==,1574783
This graphic style was more gestural and calligraphic than the geometric abstraction of December 1952.,1,14,== Notation ==,1574783

"Although this collection is misconstrued as coming out of nowhere historically, music notation has existed in many forms—both as a mechanism for creation and analysis.",2,16,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
"Brown studied what is now called Early Music, which had its own systems of notation, and was a student of the Schillinger System, which almost exclusively used graph methods for describing music.",3,16,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
"From this perspective FOLIO was an inspired, yet logical connection to be made—especially for a Northeasterner who grew up playing and improvising jazz.",4,16,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
"December 1952 consists purely of horizontal and vertical lines varying in width, spread out over the page; it is a landmark piece in the history of graphic notation of music.",0,17,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
The role of the performer is to interpret the score visually and translate the graphical information to music.,1,17,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
In Brown's notes on the work he even suggests that one consider this 2D space as 3D and imagine moving through it.,2,17,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
The other pieces in the collection are not as abstract.,3,17,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
"According to dates on the scores, Brown wrote December 1952 and then moved back towards forms of notation that contain more specific musical information.",4,17,== December 1952 and FOLIO ==,1574783
