"Many of his pieces are quite short, lasting no longer than one or two minutes.",1,5,== Works ==,1775764
"Although the compositional methods are clearly experimental, involving, for example, aleatory methods, there is a marked emphasis on the melody in many pieces.",2,5,== Works ==,1775764

The pianist is asked to sustain certain pitches by humming.,8,5,== Works ==,1775764
"Another early piece, Drum No. 1 (1969), composed for the Scratch Orchestra, consists of just a few written instructions to the performers and is clearly inspired by similarly realised works by La Monte Young, whose music Cardew was enthusiastically propagating in the late 1960s.",9,5,== Works ==,1775764
"The score of May Pole (1971), a piece for orchestra, consists of a chance-determined sequence of chords.",10,5,== Works ==,1775764
"Each performer chooses a note from a chord, and chooses the moment when to play that note.",11,5,== Works ==,1775764

"The early 1970s saw a slow shift from static, abstract pieces to pieces with more clearly defined rhythmic and harmonic structures, although the methods and forms Skempton used remained unorthodox.",0,6,== Works ==,1775764
"For instance, in the series of Quavers piano pieces (1973–75) the music consists solely of repeated chords with no pauses between them.",1,6,== Works ==,1775764

"The ""melodies"" are single melodic lines either with simple accompaniment (Saltaire Melody, for piano (1977)) or suspended in space (later works such as Trace for piano (1980) and Bagatelle for flute (1985)).",3,6,== Works ==,1775764
"""Chorales"" are works where material is presented primarily (or solely) using chords.",4,6,== Works ==,1775764
"An example is Postlude (1978), for piano, in contradistinction to Eirenicon 3 (1978), also for piano, which is a ""landscape"".",5,6,== Works ==,1775764
"The earlier ""melodies"" were apparently composed at the instrument, intuitively, whereas the later ones evolve from a series of written pitches.",6,6,== Works ==,1775764
"It was also in the 1970s that Skempton started composing chamber works, although these were almost always for two performers, since they were written to be performed by the duo of Skempton himself and Michael Parsons.",7,6,== Works ==,1775764

"The composer described it as ""essentially the same as what I was doing before, but on an orchestral scale"".",2,7,== Works ==,1775764
"Although the work is clearly a ""chorale"" in the sense Postlude and similar pieces are, during the 1980s Skempton's range expanded greatly, leading to works such as The Durham Strike (1985), which is a set of piano variations that is longer than any of the previous piano pieces, Images (1989), a large cycle of piano works for a TV documentary, and chamber works scored for larger forces than those used previously.",3,7,== Works ==,1775764
"Skempton's first major success came in 1991 with the premiere of Lento (1990), an orchestral piece that gained a larger audience for the composer.",0,8,== Works ==,1775764
During the 1990s and the 2000s Skempton started composing longer works for larger forces.,1,8,== Works ==,1775764
