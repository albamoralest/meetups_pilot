"Andriessen began in the style of an intentionally dry neoclassicism, but then turned into a strict serialist.",0,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214
"His early works show experimentation with various contemporary trends: post-war serialism (Series, 1958), pastiche (Anachronie I, 1966–67), and tape (Il Duce, 1973).",1,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214

"From the early 1970s on he refused to write for conventional symphony orchestras and instead opted to write for his own idiosyncratic instrumental combinations, which often retain some traditional orchestral instruments alongside electric guitars, electric basses, and congas.",3,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214
"Andiessen repeatedly used his music for political confessions and messages, but he also referred to painting and philosophy.",4,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214
"His range of inspiration was wide, from the music of Charles Ives in Anachronie I, the art of Mondriaan in De Stijl, and medieval poetic visions in Hadewijch, to writings on shipbuilding and atomic theory in De Materie Part I. Andriessen's later style is a unique blend of American sounds and European forms.",5,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214
"His mature music combines the influences of jazz, American minimalism, Igor Stravinsky, and Claude Vivier.",6,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214
"The music consists of minimalist polyrhythms, lyrical melodic fragments, predominantly consonant harmonies disrupted by explosive blocks of concentrated dissonance.",7,11,== Style and notable works ==,18214
