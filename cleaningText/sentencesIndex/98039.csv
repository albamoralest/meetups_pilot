"During his time with the Byrds, McGuinn developed two innovative and very influential styles of electric guitar playing.",0,6,== The Byrds ==,98039
"The first was ""jingle-jangle"" – generating ringing arpeggios based on banjo finger picking styles he learned while at the Old Town School of Folk – which was influential in the folk rock genre.",1,6,== The Byrds ==,98039
"The second style was a merging of saxophonist John Coltrane's free-jazz atonalities, which hinted at the droning of the sitar – a style of playing, first heard on the Byrds' 1966 single ""Eight Miles High"", which was influential in psychedelic rock.",2,6,== The Byrds ==,98039

"The engineer, Ray Gerhardt, would run compressors on everything to protect his precious equipment from loud rock and roll.",5,7,== The Byrds ==,98039

That's how I got my 'jingle-jangle' tone.,7,7,== The Byrds ==,98039
"It's really squashed down, but it jumps out from the radio.",8,7,== The Byrds ==,98039

I also translated some of my banjo picking techniques to the 12-string.,15,7,== The Byrds ==,98039
