"Sorabji wrote in 1960 that he almost never sought to blend Eastern and Western music, and although he had positive things to say about Indian music in the 1920s, he later criticised what he saw as limitations inherent in it and the raga, including a lack of thematic development, which was sidelined in favour of repetition.",2,42,== Music == | === Inspiration and influences ===,1127222

"Another assessment was offered by the music critic Peter J. Rabinowitz, who, reviewing the 2015 reissue of Habermann's early Sorabji recordings, wrote that they ""may provide a clue about why—even with the advocacy of some of the most ferociously talented pianists of the age—Sorabji's music has remained arcane"".",13,63,== Legacy == | === Reception ===,1127222
"While saying that ""it's hard not to be captivated, even hypnotized, by the sheer luxury of [his] nocturnes"" and praising the ""angular, dramatic, electrically crackling gestures"" of some of his works, he claims that their tendency to ""ostentatiously avoid the traditional Western rhetoric ... that marks out beginning, middle, and end or that sets up strong patterns of expectation and resolution"" makes them hard to approach.",14,63,== Legacy == | === Reception ===,1127222

"Ullén suggests that Sorabji's 100 Transcendental Studies (1940–44) can be seen as presaging the piano music of Ligeti, Michael Finnissy and Brian Ferneyhough, although he cautions against overstating this.",5,65,== Legacy == | === Innovation ===,1127222
"Roberge compares the opening of Sorabji's orchestral piece Chaleur—Poème (1916–17) to the micropolyphonic texture of Ligeti's Atmosphères (1961) and Powell has noted the use of metric modulation in Sequentia cyclica (1948–49), which was composed around the same time as (and independently from) Elliott Carter's 1948 Cello Sonata, the first work in which Carter employed the technique.",6,65,== Legacy == | === Innovation ===,1127222
