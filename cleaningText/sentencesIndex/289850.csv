Harry Somers was immensely successful as a composer.,0,15,== Composer ==,289850
"He had an eclectic, personal  approach to 20th century styles and composed a large body of work that walked a fine line between an elite modernity and popular appeal.",1,15,== Composer ==,289850
"His works were performed nationally and internationally during his lifetime, with performances in the USA, Central and South Americas, Europe and the Soviet Union.",2,15,== Composer ==,289850
His output consisted essentially of tonal works that incorporated elements of atonality later on in his career.,3,15,== Composer ==,289850
Somers described his approach to composition as follows:,0,16,== Composer ==,289850
"""Over the years I've worked consistently on three different levels with three different approaches to composition.",0,17,== Composer ==,289850
On one level my approach has been what I call 'community music' or 'music for use':,1,17,== Composer ==,289850
For example music for amateurs and music for school use.,2,17,== Composer ==,289850
"On a second level I've created 'functional music,' in the specific sense: music for television, films and theatre, where the composition has to work in company with another medium and serve the demands of that medium.",3,17,== Composer ==,289850
"On a third level I have created without consideration for any limitations, sometimes completely experimentally, sometimes extending the line of a particular direction on which I had been working through a series of works.",4,17,== Composer ==,289850
"In short, the first two levels relate directly to the environment and society, in the broad sense, in which I live at the moment, and in which I function as a craftsman; the third relates to a more restricted audience (though I'm not convinced it need be so) and my personal development as an artist.""",0,18,== Composer ==,289850

Somers music is known for its diversity of influences and themes.,0,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"Due to the isolated nature of Toronto during the 20th century, the city in which he first began composing, Somers was fortunate enough to develop his own sense of originality before he began his formal compositional studies.",1,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"Once he began studying at the Royal Conservatory, his sources of influence increased and his musical palate grew as well.",2,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"The people and styles that are said to have influence him the most are the music of Weinzweig, Bartók and Ives, Baroque counterpoint, serial technique and Gregorian chant.",3,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"Somers himself said that he aimed to ""unify conceptions of the Baroque … with the high tensioned elements of our own time"" in many of his compositions.",4,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
Somers also makes great and unique use of dynamics.,5,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"He developed a technique for creating what he referred to as ‘dynamic unrest’ which consists of one sound sustained, be it chord or singular pitch, isolated or prolonged in a melodic line, developing a dynamic envelope of its own.",6,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
It was under the guidance of Weinzweig during the 1940s that Somers received his first formal instruction in composition.,7,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"Prior to that point, he composed mainly in the style of the piano works he was playing, but with a notable creative spark.",8,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"With Weinzweig, this spark was fanned into a flame and Somers’ compositional style refined.",9,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"He began working with thinner textures, developed a more horizontally orientated approach to his pieces and established control over motivic coherence.",10,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"These developments can be seen most clearly in the outer movements of North Country (1948), a four-movement suite for string orchestra.",11,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"In this work, Somers uses ""nervous rhythmic vitality, sparse textures in a relatively dissonant context and lean melodic lines in a high register (often contrasting sharply with a driving ostinato-like accompaniment)",12,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"[to] subtly evoke the bleakness, loneliness and strength of the northern Ontario landscape.""",13,20,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"During the 1950s Somers focused on two main ideas in his compositions: the use of fugue-related textures and techniques, and the use of different styles and techniques within the same work.",0,21,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
Well over half of the works written between 1950 and 1961 contain fugal movements or sections.,1,21,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"Many more feature ""sharp, nervous, rhythmic vitality, which often serves as a foil for slower-moving subsidiary melodic lines.""",2,21,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850
"Demonstrations of these ideas can be heard in his Passacaglia and Fugue (1954), the last section of String Quartet no.3 and the second sections of Five Concepts.",3,21,== Composer == | === Style ===,289850

Somers’s approach to serialism was intuitive and always kept within the realm of accessibility.,0,23,== Composer == | === Serialism ===,289850
"When he began his studies with Weinzweig, Somers dabbled in the use of serialism in his music, but he refrained from drastically implementing it into his pieces until 1950.",0,24,== Composer == | === Serialism ===,289850
"Even then, it was never the main aspect of his work, but rather acted as supportive material for other elements.",1,24,== Composer == | === Serialism ===,289850
"Prior to 1959, he tended to keep sections that included serial elements contained within tonal confines.",2,24,== Composer == | === Serialism ===,289850
