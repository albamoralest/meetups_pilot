"Greenblatt first used the term ""New Historicism"" in his 1982 introduction to The Power of Forms in the English Renaissance wherein he uses Queen Elizabeth I's ""bitter reaction to the revival of Shakespeare's Richard II on the eve of the Essex rebellion"" to illustrate the ""mutual permeability of the literary and the historical"".",0,11,== Work == | === New Historicism ===,226510
