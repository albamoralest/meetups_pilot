Since all facilities were connected via a subterranean corridor it was possible to switch around and use the entire technical equipment range of all three studios.,3,20,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509

In 1991 this mobile studio was used to record a Rolling Stones live album in Moscow and other European cities.,11,20,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509
Eventually the studio hotel ended up being too small for long-term international residents.,0,21,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509
"So in 1986 Dierks bought a mansion with huge gardens – suitable for long-term stays – in Bruchstraße, around two kilometres away from the studios.",1,21,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509

So far only Studio 3 offered facilities for film and video recording.,1,22,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509

Several mobile units featuring HDTV technology were added to the fleet in 1997.,7,24,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509
This technology produced extremely high-resolution images by using special cameras and was particularly popular with the technology-affined customers from the US and Japan who tended to order numerous classical recordings.,8,24,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509
The Kirch Group for example booked these units for the recording of the Wagner Festival in Bayreuth.,9,24,== Further studio expansion and motion picture technology ==,3715509
