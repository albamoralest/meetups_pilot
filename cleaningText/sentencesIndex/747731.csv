Russell's Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization re-conceptualized the matching of scales with chords.,0,21,== Music theory ==,747731
"While the conventional approach to the diatonic major scale is founded on the tones of the Ionian major scale in accordance with classical theory (C, D, E, F, G, A, B for the C major scale, etc.)",1,21,== Music theory ==,747731
the LCC derives the scales based on the series of fifths stacked from the root tones of chords with a major third.,2,21,== Music theory ==,747731
"In the key of C, the stacked fifth series includes C, G, D, A, E, B, and F♯, which provide an alternate seven tone division for the C major scale with a raised, or augmented, fourth tone.",3,21,== Music theory ==,747731
"The resulting scale, with an augmented fourth (F♯) instead of a perfect fourth (F), has more consonance than the conventional Ionian diatonic major scale over chords, avoiding the dissonant half-step from the major third (E).",4,21,== Music theory ==,747731
"With the conventional major scale, dissonance is avoided by omitting the perfect fourth; by using the Lydian mode with the more consonant augmented fourth, the player or composer gains the tonal freedom that facilitates modal playing over chords with a major third.",5,21,== Music theory ==,747731
"Lydian major-third chords are specified with a ♯11, which is equivalent to the ♯4 in the scale.",6,21,== Music theory ==,747731
It was a remark made by Miles Davis in 1945 when Russell asked him his musical aim that led Russell on a quest which was to lead to his theoretical breakthrough.,0,22,== Music theory ==,747731
"Davis answered that his musical aim was ""to learn all the changes.""",1,22,== Music theory ==,747731
"Knowing that Davis already knew how to arpeggiate each chord, Russell reasoned that he really meant that he wanted to find a new and broader way to relate to chords.",2,22,== Music theory ==,747731
As musician and scholar Darius Brubeck wrote:,3,22,== Music theory ==,747731
Russell codified the modal approach to harmony ... inspired by a casual remark the eighteen-year-old Miles Davis made to him in 1944: Miles said he wanted to learn all the changes and I reasoned he might try to find the closest scale for every chord ...,0,23,== Music theory ==,747731
"Davis popularized those liberating ideas in recordings like Kind of Blue, undermining the entire harmonic foundation of bop that had inspired him and Russell in the first place.: 191",1,23,== Music theory ==,747731
"Miles reportedly summarized the LCC succinctly by saying, ""F should be where middle C is on the piano"" [white notes: F-F = Lydian major, rather than Ionian major = C-C].: 191 The Lydian Chromatic Concept was the first codified original theory to come from jazz.",0,24,== Music theory ==,747731
"Musicians who assimilated Russell's ideas expanded their harmonic language beyond that of bebop, into the realm of post-bop.",1,24,== Music theory ==,747731
"Russell's ideas influenced the development of modal jazz, notably in the album Jazz Workshop (1957, with Bill Evans and featuring the ""Concerto for Billy the Kid"") as well as his writings.",2,24,== Music theory ==,747731
Miles Davis also pushed into modal playing with the composition Miles on his 1957 album Milestones.,3,24,== Music theory ==,747731
"Davis and Evans later collaborated on the 1959 album Kind of Blue, which featured modal composition and playing.",4,24,== Music theory ==,747731
John Coltrane explored modal playing for several years after playing on Kind of Blue.,5,24,== Music theory ==,747731
His Lydian Concept has been described as making available resources rather than imposing constraints on musicians.,0,25,== Music theory ==,747731
"According to the influential 20th century composer Toru Takemitsu, ""The Lydian Chromatic Concept is one of the two most splendid books about music; the other is My Musical Language by Messiaen.",1,25,== Music theory ==,747731
"Though I'm considered a contemporary music composer, if I dare categorize myself as an artist, I've been strongly influenced by the Lydian Concept, which is not simply a musical method—we might call it a philosophy of music, or we might call it poetry.""",2,25,== Music theory ==,747731
"The major scale probably emerged as the predominating scale of Western music, because within its seven tones lies the most fundamental harmonic progression of the classical era ...",0,26,== Music theory ==,747731
"thus, the major scale resolves to its tonic major chord.",1,26,== Music theory ==,747731
The Lydian scale is the sound of its tonic major chord.:,2,26,== Music theory ==,747731
