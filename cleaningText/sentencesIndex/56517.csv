"Raymond Merrill Smullyan (; May 25, 1919 – February 6, 2017) was an American mathematician, magician, concert pianist, logician, Taoist, and philosopher.",0,0,N/A,56517
"Born in Far Rockaway, New York, his first career was stage magic.",0,1,N/A,56517
He earned a BSc from the University of Chicago in 1955 and his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1959.,1,1,N/A,56517
He is one of many logicians to have studied with Alonzo Church.,2,1,N/A,56517

"Born in Far Rockaway, New York to Armenian parents, Smullyan showed musical talent from a young age, winning a gold medal in a piano competition when he was aged 12.",0,3,== Life ==,56517
"The following year, his family moved to Manhattan and he attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in The Bronx, which offered classes suited to his musical talents.",1,3,== Life ==,56517
"He left to study on his own, as the school did not offer similar courses in mathematics.",2,3,== Life ==,56517
He studied mathematics and music at several colleges (including Pacific University and Reed College) before receiving an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago in 1955 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University in 1959.,3,3,== Life ==,56517
"He completed his doctoral dissertation, titled ""Theory of formal systems"", under the supervision of Alonzo Church.",4,3,== Life ==,56517
"While a Ph.D. student, Smullyan published a paper in the 1957 Journal of Symbolic Logic showing that Gödelian incompleteness held for formal systems considerably more elementary than that of Kurt Gödel's 1931 landmark paper.",5,3,== Life ==,56517
The contemporary understanding of Gödel's theorem dates from this 1931 paper.,6,3,== Life ==,56517
"Smullyan later made a compelling case that much of the fascination with Gödel's theorem should be directed at Tarski's theorem, which is much easier to prove and equally disturbing philosophically.",7,3,== Life ==,56517
Smullyan wrote many books about recreational mathematics and recreational logic.,8,3,== Life ==,56517
"Most notably, one is titled What Is the Name of This Book? ISBN 0139550623.",9,3,== Life ==,56517
"His A Beginner's Further Guide to Mathematical Logic ISBN 978-981-4730-99-0, published in 2017, was his final book.",10,3,== Life ==,56517
"He was a professor of mathematics and philosophy at Lehman College, the CUNY Graduate Center and Indiana University.",0,4,== Life ==,56517
"He was also an amateur astronomer, using a six-inch reflecting telescope for which he ground the mirror.",1,4,== Life ==,56517
Fellow mathematician Martin Gardner was a close friend.,2,4,== Life ==,56517
==,0,5,== Logic problems ==,56517
Logic problems ==,1,5,== Logic problems ==,56517
Many of his logic problems are extensions of classic puzzles.,0,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
Knights and Knaves involves knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie).,1,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"This is based on a story of two doors and two guards, one who lies and one who tells the truth.",2,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"One door leads to heaven and one to hell, and the puzzle is to find out which door leads to heaven by asking one of the guards a question.",3,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"One way to do this is to ask, ""Which door would the other guard say leads to hell?"".",4,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Unfortunately, this fails, as the liar can answer, ""He would say the door to paradise leads to hell,"" and the truth-teller would answer, ""He would say the door to paradise leads to hell.""",5,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
You must point at one of the doors as well as simply stating a question.,6,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"For example, as philosopher Richard Turnbull has explained, you could point at either door and ask, ""Will the other guard say this is the door to paradise?""",7,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"The truth-teller will say ""No, "" if it is in fact the door to paradise, as will the liar.",8,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
So you pick that door.,9,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"The truth-teller will answer ""Yes,"" if it is the door to Hell, as will the liar, so you pick the other door.",10,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Note also that we are not told anything about the goals of either guard: for all we know, the liar may want to help us and the truth-teller not help us,  or both are indifferent, so there's no reason to think either one will phrase answers such as to provide us with the most optimally available kind of comprehension.",11,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
This is behind the crucial role of actually pointing at a door directly while asking the question.,12,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
This idea was famously used in the 1986 film Labyrinth.,13,6,== Logic problems ==,56517
"In more complex puzzles, he introduces characters who may lie or tell the truth (referred to as ""normals""), and furthermore instead of answering ""yes"" or ""no"", use words which mean ""yes"" or ""no"", but the reader does not know which word means which.",0,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"The puzzle known as ""the hardest logic puzzle ever"" is based on these characters and themes.",1,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"In his Transylvania puzzles, half of the inhabitants are insane, and believe only false things, whereas the other half are sane and believe only true things.",2,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"In addition, humans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie.",3,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"For example, an insane vampire will believe a false thing (2 + 2 is not 4) but will then lie about it, and say that it is false.",4,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"A sane vampire knows 2 + 2 is 4, but will lie and say it is not.",5,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
And mutatis mutandis for humans.,6,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Thus everything said by a sane human or an insane vampire is true, while everything said by an insane human or a sane vampire is false.",7,7,== Logic problems ==,56517
"His book Forever Undecided popularizes Gödel's incompleteness theorems by phrasing them in terms of reasoners and their beliefs, rather than formal systems and what can be proved in them.",0,8,== Logic problems ==,56517
"For example, if a native of a knight/knave island says to a sufficiently self-aware reasoner, ""You will never believe that I am a knight"", the reasoner cannot believe either that the native is a knight or that he is a knave without becoming inconsistent (i.e., holding two contradictory beliefs).",1,8,== Logic problems ==,56517
"The equivalent theorem is that for any formal system S, there exists a mathematical statement that can be interpreted as ""This statement is not provable in formal system S"".",2,8,== Logic problems ==,56517
"If the system S is consistent, neither the statement nor its opposite will be provable in it.",3,8,== Logic problems ==,56517

"Inspector Craig is a frequent character in Smullyan's ""puzzle-novellas.""",0,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
He is generally called into a scene of a crime that has a solution that is mathematical in nature.,1,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Then, through a series of increasingly harder challenges, he (and the reader) begin to understand the principles in question.",2,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Finally the novella culminates in Inspector Craig (and the reader) solving the crime, utilizing the mathematical and logical principles learned.",3,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Inspector Craig generally does not learn the formal theory in question, and Smullyan usually reserves a few chapters after the Inspector Craig adventure to illuminate the analogy for the reader.",4,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
Inspector Craig gets his name from William Craig.,5,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
His book To Mock a Mockingbird (1985) is a recreational introduction to the subject of combinatory logic.,6,9,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Apart from writing about and teaching logic, Smullyan released a recording of his favorite baroque keyboard and classical piano pieces by composers such as Bach, Scarlatti, and Schubert.",0,10,== Logic problems ==,56517
"Some recordings are available on the Piano Society website, along with the video ""Rambles, Reflections, Music and Readings"".",1,10,== Logic problems ==,56517
He has also written an autobiography titled Some Interesting Memories: A Paradoxical Life (ISBN 1-888710-10-1).,2,10,== Logic problems ==,56517
"In 2001, documentary filmmaker Tao Ruspoli made a film about Smullyan called This Film Needs No Title: A Portrait of Raymond Smullyan.",0,11,== Logic problems ==,56517
==,0,12,== Philosophy ==,56517
Philosophy ==,1,12,== Philosophy ==,56517
"Smullyan wrote several books about Taoist philosophy, a philosophy he believed neatly solved most or all traditional philosophical problems as well as integrating mathematics, logic, and philosophy into a cohesive whole.",0,13,== Philosophy ==,56517
One of Smullyan's discussions of Taoist philosophy centers on the question of free will in an imagined conversation between a mortal human and God.,1,13,== Philosophy ==,56517
