Ernst Eduard Kummer (29 January 1810 – 14 May 1893) was a German mathematician.,0,0,N/A,319117
"Skilled in applied mathematics, Kummer trained German army officers in ballistics; afterwards, he taught for 10 years in a gymnasium, the German equivalent of high school, where he inspired the mathematical career of Leopold Kronecker.",1,0,N/A,319117

"He was awarded a PhD from the University of Halle in 1831 for writing a prize-winning mathematical essay (De cosinuum et sinuum potestatibus secundum cosinus et sinus arcuum multiplicium evolvendis), which was eventually published a year later.",1,2,== Life ==,319117
"In 1840, Kummer married Ottilie Mendelssohn, daughter of Nathan Mendelssohn and Henriette Itzig.",0,3,== Life ==,319117
"Ottilie was a cousin of Felix Mendelssohn and his sister Rebecca Mendelssohn Bartholdy, the wife of the mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.",1,3,== Life ==,319117
"His second wife (whom he married soon after the death of Ottilie in 1848), Bertha Cauer, was a maternal cousin of Ottilie.",2,3,== Life ==,319117

"The Kummer surface results from taking the quotient of a two-dimensional abelian variety by the cyclic group {1, −1} (an early orbifold: it has 16 singular points, and its geometry was intensively studied in the nineteenth century).",1,5,== Mathematics ==,319117
"Kummer also proved Fermat's Last Theorem for a considerable class of prime exponents (see regular prime, ideal class group).",0,6,== Mathematics ==,319117
"His methods were closer, perhaps, to p-adic ones than to ideal theory as understood later, though the term 'ideal' was invented by Kummer.",1,6,== Mathematics ==,319117
"He studied what were later called Kummer extensions of fields: that is, extensions generated by adjoining an nth root to a field already containing a primitive nth root of unity.",2,6,== Mathematics ==,319117
"This is a significant extension of the theory of quadratic extensions, and the genus theory of quadratic forms (linked to the 2-torsion of the class group).",3,6,== Mathematics ==,319117
