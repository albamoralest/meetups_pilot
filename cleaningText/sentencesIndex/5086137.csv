"Tanaka Shōhei (田中正平, Tanaka Shōhei, May 15, 1862 – October 16, 1945) was a Japanese physicist, music theorist, and inventor.",0,0,N/A,5086137
He graduated from Tokyo University in 1882 as a science student.,1,0,N/A,5086137
"On an imperial scholarship, he was sent to Germany for doctoral studies in 1884, together with Mori Ōgai.",2,0,N/A,5086137
His dissertation concerned just intonation and practical means to its implementation.,3,0,N/A,5086137
Tanaka was an early advocate of 53 equal temperament as a means of closely approximating 5-limit just intonation.,0,1,N/A,5086137
"He was the first to obtain a clear understanding of the temperament, noticing that it tempered out both the schisma, 32805/32768, but also the kleisma (Play ), an interval of size 15625/15552 =",1,1,N/A,5086137
"2−6 3−5 56, which is the interval by which five just minor thirds of size 6/5 exactly differs from a just tenth of size 5/2 exactly.",2,1,N/A,5086137
Tanaka was the first to take practical note of this interval and gave it its name.,3,1,N/A,5086137
Tanaka realized that the 53 equal temperament was completely characterized as a five limit temperament by the fact that it tempers out both the schisma and the kleisma.,4,1,N/A,5086137
Tanaka was also an early advocate of the use of the hexagonal lattice for representing the pitch classes of 5-limit just intonation.,0,2,N/A,5086137
"First proposed in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler, this model was also used by Hugo Riemann in his theory of harmony.",1,2,N/A,5086137
Tanaka also suggested what would now be called a Fokker block as a way of viewing the pitch classes of 53 equal temperament.,2,2,N/A,5086137
"Tanaka proposed a set of harmonic cadences designed to reflect a traditional Japanese aesthetic, acknowledging pentatonic scales and incorporating suspended tones in the manner of the chords played by the shō.",0,3,N/A,5086137
Tanaka's suggestion was taken up by a number of 20th-century Japanese composers and theorists.,1,3,N/A,5086137
Tanaka was an inventor as well as a theoretician.,2,3,N/A,5086137
He designed and patented a just intonation Enharmonium (enharmonic+harmonium) with 20 keys and 26 pitches in an octave.,3,3,N/A,5086137
"He had Johannes Kewitsch, of Berlin, construct a 5-octave version and in 1891 he demonstrated it to Anton Bruckner in Vienna, who was impressed with its potential.",4,3,N/A,5086137
He also constructed an early calculating machine.,5,3,N/A,5086137
