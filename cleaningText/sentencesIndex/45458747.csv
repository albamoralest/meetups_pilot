"This period is also notable in that it represents the burgeoning heavy rock era that gave rise to a ""New Wave"" of heavy rock involving Thompson at the next stage of his career.",5,2,== Early years ==,45458747
Hugh Murphy (Gerry Rafferty/Baker Street) later replaced Bain in the production chair.,6,2,== Early years ==,45458747

"In 1978 he joined Impulse Studios in Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, England.",0,4,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"His role was twofold (1) to encourage studio usage by local bands and where necessary act as producer, (2) develop a publishing arm (Neat Music Publishing) at the same time developing his own songwriting.",1,4,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Initially recordings were released in an Impulse subsidiary Rubber Records but in 1979 he helped set up a new record label ""Neat Records"".",2,4,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"The first single was one of Thompson's own songs ""One and Only Girl"" with an 11-year-old singer Janie McKenzie who was making a name for herself in the clubs.",3,4,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Thompson also produced the second Neat Single: ""All I Wanna Be Is Your Romeo"" by a band called Motorway.",4,4,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"It was the third Thompson produced single that was to establish the label as a heavy metal/rock outfit and this was ""Don't Touch Me There"" by the Tygers of Pan Tang.",5,4,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
After the release of the Tygers of Pan Tang single the resulting excitement was remarkable.,0,5,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
The single did really well and was picked up for release by MCA Records and an album deal was struck.,1,5,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"There was also a sudden interest in other bands of the same genre wishing to be signed to the label,",2,5,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
One such act was Tony McPhee formerly of The Groundhogs who recorded two tracks for the label that were unfortunately never released.,0,6,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Thompson not only produced the McPhee tracks but also played bass.,1,6,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Present on that session was a young man named Conrad Lant who had recently joined the studio as tape-op (tape operative assistant).,2,6,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Conrad expressed an interest in the bass guitar Thompson had brought into the studio from his old bass playing days:-,3,6,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"""Lant borrowed a bass guitar from Steve Thompson (later to become Venom's first producer).",0,7,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Playing the show with the borrowed bass plugged into his Marshall guitar amp and effects pedals, he created an unnerving racket and the 'Bulldozer Bass' was born.""",1,7,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Thompson had quite wide-ranging responsibilities at Impulse/Neat.,0,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"As house producer he presided over a wide range of recordings and not just the Neat product, things such as writing and/or producing TV commercials and various bespoke recordings.",1,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
As the label developed and demo submissions from bands increased he functioned as A&R manager for the label as well as managing the publishing arm.,2,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
He also pursued his own songwriting and for this a various other studio recordings he established a bank of session musicians.,3,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Some noteworthy musicians passed through these ranks including Andy Taylor of Duran Duran (guitar) and Alan Clark of Dire Straits (keyboards).,4,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
With his assembled team of musicians he worked with a number of local acts to develop their careers.,5,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
One such young acts was young singer Toni Halliday (later of Curve),6,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Of all the songs he wrote and produced with Toni, one was to become notable and successful with another act entirely and this was Paris",7,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
By Air which the Tygers of Pan Tang recorded.,8,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Having produced the first singles released by Neat Records Thompson went on to produce the first album released by the label.,9,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
This was Rock Until You Drop by Raven.,10,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Rock Until You Drop was really well received, reached position No. 63 in the UK Albums Chart and is still considered a landmark album to this day.",11,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"During recording sessions Thompson dubbed the band's genre ""Athletic Rock"" and has told studio stories of Gaffa taping headphones to the band's heads to stop them flying off.",12,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"This and other anecdotes (including the source of the marching sounds on Rock Until You Drop) are revealed in Thompson's interviews for Ravens 2013 DVD, ""Rock Until You Drop, A Long Days Journey"".",13,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
In 1980 Thompson re-established his acquaintance with Bullfrog's first producer Roger Bain.,14,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Roger was now A&R manager for Phonogram Records and introduced Steve to legendary producer Gus Dudgeon (Elton John, Elkie Brooks, David Bowie)",15,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Gus travelled with Roger to Impulse studios in Wallsend (Neat) where Thompson laid on a showcase performance for them with the house band of session musicians he had assembled (Steve himself playing guitar).,16,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"The house band was fronted by the vocal talents of the Caffrey Brothers, 3 actual siblings with a fine vocal blend.",17,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
The Caffreys had been providing backing vocals on many recordings at the studio but in this instance they were the featured artists.,18,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Roger signed the act to Phonogram and Gus produced the recordings.,19,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Sadly the recordings failed to chart but Thompson was to work with Dudgeon on several projects over the years.,20,8,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Another signing to the Neat Label were Fist.,0,9,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Thompson produced some tracks with Fist and actually joined the band guitar for a while replacing Dave Irwin.,1,9,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
His membership of Fist was short-lived and based largely on the fact that Fist wanted to record some of Thompson's songs but felt that any writer should also be a member of the band.,2,9,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
Thompson's final production for the label was a 3 track single with Venom the title track being in League With Satan.,0,10,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Thompson claims to have introduced the band to ""The Devil"" (actually a musical interval).",1,10,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747
"Having given the world ""Black Metal"" it appears that Thompson then quit the label.",2,10,== Impulse Studios and Neat records ==,45458747

Songwriting years ==,1,11,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Thompson eventually quit Neat Records in 1981.,0,12,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
It is to be assumed that he did so to concentrate on his songwriting because beyond this time his production credits became fewer whilst his writing credits increased.,1,12,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In 1982, he enjoyed a top 20 hit with a recording by Wavelength of his song ""Hurry Home"".",2,12,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The song stayed in the UK charts for a full 3 months and peaked at 17 where it stayed for two consecutive weeks.,3,12,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"""Hurry Home"" was also later recorded by Sarah Brightman and released as the second CD in a special edition of her album The Fly.",4,12,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In late 1982, Pete Waterman signed Thompson to an exclusive songwriting deal with MCA Music Publishing.",0,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Waterman became Thompson's mentor and introduced him to his business partner, producer Peter Collins.",1,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Collins was to produce a number of recordings of Thompson's songs over the coming years including The Searchers, Elaine Paige and Colin Blunstone.",2,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"The Searchers single ""I Don't Want To Be The One"" was the last to be released by the band and was also released on an album, Street Scene which reached 42 in the UK Albums Chart.",3,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
There followed a fertile period for Thompson under Waterman's management and Thompson himself has written a good deal about some of the quirky events that befell him whilst with Waterman.,4,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
One story in particular involves Thompson writing lyrics at Watermans instigation for the theme to the movie Jaws 3-D. Thompson himself writes about this on his own website but the story has gained some traction even some derision,5,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
but it seems that the producers were seriously considering this approach at one time.,6,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Just prior to Thompson joining MCA Music it had been planned that the Tygers of Pan Tang would record his song ""Paris By Air"" for their 3rd studio album.",7,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Although Thompson had not worked with the band since producing their first single this had come about because he had shared a house in Whitley Bay with Tygers vocalist Jon Deverill,",8,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
guitarist John Sykes and (strangely?),9,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
original vocalist Jess Cox.,10,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"When Thompson returned home in the evenings from the studio, there were frequent play-back sessions (often initiated by Sykes) of whatever he had been recording that day.",11,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
It was on one of these impromptu playback sessions that the Tygers heard Toni Haliday's rendition of Paris By Air.,12,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
When it was time to record their 3rd album Paris,13,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
By Air chosen to be recorded.,14,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"However, as this song was written specifically for Toni Halliday it needed to be altered significantly to be suitable for a male vocal and Thompson set about this task accordingly.",15,13,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In the summer of 1982, plans were well under way for the recording of the Tygers next album (to be called The Cage), when John Sykes suddenly quit the band.",0,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
This caused problems as he was heavily involved in the writing of new material.,1,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
A replacement guitarist was needed but material was also needed.,2,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
One of the people approached for suitable songs was Thompson.,3,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"He provided some of his new material and also undertook to co-write with the band's vocalist, Jon Deverill.",4,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Of his own songs ""Lonely at the Top"" was picked and from the Deverill collaboration ""Letter from L.A.""",5,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The collaborative writing with Deveril continued into the next two studio albums.,6,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Fred Purser of Penetration became the band's new guitarist and the album was recorded with 3 Thompson songs included.,7,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"The Cage sold over 200,000 copies and entered the top 20 in the UK album charts peaking at 13.",8,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Paris By Air entered the singles charts and reached number 63.,9,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Another Thompson song, ""Lonely at The Top"" was also released as a single but failed to chart.",10,14,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In 1982, Sheena Easton released her Madness, Money & Music album which contained the Steve Thompson song ""Please Don't Sympathise"".",0,15,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The album charted at 44 in the UK Albums Chart.,1,15,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The US version did not include Thompson's track but on later editions it was included.,2,15,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In 1983, Thompson wrote English lyrics for the Italian Eurovision Song Contest Per Lucia by Riccardo Fogli.",0,16,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Fogli finished in 11th place.,1,16,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The recording was released in some countries with Thompson's English lyric.,2,16,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Copies of this recording are extremely rare.,3,16,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In 1983, Celine Dion recorded the same song (Please Don't Sympathise) and with a French adaptation by Eddie Marnay it was released as ""Ne me plaignez pas"" on her album Les chemins de ma maison.",0,17,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The song was also released as a single and charted in both Canada and France.,1,17,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"The album sold 100,000 copies and went Gold in Canada It also received a Félix Award for the Best Selling Album of the Year.",2,17,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Celine also recorded an extended version of ""Ne me plaignez pas,"" which appeared on her album Du soleil au cœur released in France.",3,17,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"A music video was made in 1984, for the Sur les chemins de ma maison TV special.",4,17,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The song has also subsequently appeared on several compilation CD's.,5,17,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"In 1984, Thompson once again joined forces with Gus Dudgeon who brought the legendary Dick James (the man who signed the Beatles) out of retirement to sign Steve to an exclusive songwriting agreement with DJM (Dick James Music)",0,18,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Oddly, the success of the Cage album had caused the Tygers of Pan Tang to split up and Thompson continued his songwriting partnership with Tygers vocalist Jon Deveril with the intention of seeking a solo recording deal.",0,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
A full album's worth of material was written and demo'd and talks were taking place with record companies when John Sykes returned from a Japanese tour with Whitesnake and told Deveril and Thompson about the huge interest there in the Tygers of Pan Tang.,1,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
He suggested that if the proposed Deveril/Thompson album were to become the follow up to the Cage there would be likely to be huge interest.,2,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Sykes also offered the brand new studio he'd built in Blackpool as a place to cut the album.,3,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Tygers founding member Brian Dick was approached and he agreed to team up.,4,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The line up was then completed by Steve Lamb and Neil Shepherd on guitars and Paul Irwin on bass.,5,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Phil Harding who had engineered the Cage album for Peter Collins was brought in to produce and a deal was struck with the Music for Nations label to release what was to be The Wreck-Age, The Tygers of Pan Tang's 5th studio album.",6,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Thompson played keyboards on the album but Harding complained that Irwin (who had been brought in at short notice) was not able to cope with the bass duties and so Thompson overdubbed all the bass parts after the tracks had been laid.,7,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Dave Donaldson was brought in after the album was finished as a touring member and is credited as bass player on the album sleeve as well as being pictured on the cover.,8,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
It is common knowledge that it is Thompson playing bass on the album.,9,19,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
It would seem at this time Thompson was appearing more on more on recordings as a musician as well as a writer because around the same as the Tygers Wreck-Age album he appears (on bass and keyboards) on albums by John Verity former Guitarist/Vocalist with Argent.,0,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Verity had produced recordings with The Searchers who were labelmates at Prt Records (Pye).,1,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"One of the songs recorded was Thompson's ""Innocent Victim"" and it's likely that it's through this connection that the two met.",2,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Thompson wrote or co-wrote several tracks Verity's 1985 release ""The Truth of The Matter"" and also appears on the credits for keyboards and bass.",3,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Thompson and Verity produced a solo single by Mike Pender, ""It's Over"" whilst he was still with The Searchers.",4,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"The song title must have been prescient because shortly after the single ""It's Over"" was released Mike quite the Searchers to form Mike Pender's Searchers.",5,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
Thompson played Keyboards on a TV appearance of the new band in support of the single.,6,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Further Thompson/Verity collaborations took place after ""The Truth of the Matter"" and these recordings have been released on a variety of collections.",7,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"Gus Dudgeon produced a number of recordings of songs by the pair with Thompson on Bass and Keyboards, Verity on Guitars and vocals with a string of sessions musicians.",8,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
"One of these session musicians Mike Stacey (also known as Mike Craft) who recorded a version of "" the Thompson/Verity song ""I Want You"" with Dudgeon producing, Verity on Guitar and Thompson on Bass and Keyboards.",9,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747
The song became a finalist in the 1986 Song For Europe,10,20,== Songwriting years ==,45458747

Later career ==,1,21,== Later career ==,45458747
Having contributed to both The Tygers of Pan Tang and Verity albums as a performer as well as a writer Thompson seemed reticent to take up touring/performing again.,0,22,== Later career ==,45458747
"However, he did a couple of TV shows with the Tygers but for a while became a member of Verity's touring band doing dates in Europe and the UK (including one of the last gigs to take place in The Marquee in Wardour Street)Towards the end of the 1980s Thompson set up a publishing and production company named De Lucca with Brian Johnson of AC/DC.",1,22,== Later career ==,45458747
Johnson was by now based in the USA but Thompson was based in Newcastle upon Tyne at Johnsons' recording studios: Lynx De Lucca.,2,22,== Later career ==,45458747
"Thompson's role was similar to the one he had at Neat Records which was to seek out new talent, produce recordings and develop his own song repertoire.",3,22,== Later career ==,45458747
During this time Thompson wrote and produced an album's worth of material with Alvin Stardust (which remains unreleased) and wrote two tracks on an album for Middle of The Road.,4,22,== Later career ==,45458747
The Tygers of Pan Tan's sixth album Burning in the Shade was recorded at Lynx De Lucca at this time with Thompson on bass and keyboards as well as co-writing all the songs.,0,23,== Later career ==,45458747
"Co-writing and production continued with John Verity with recordings appearing on a range of releases including ""Rock Solid"" and ""Hold Your Head Up"" and ""Routes""",0,24,== Later career ==,45458747
Thompson had also been working with a young singer Peter Adshead who went on to success under the name of Baby Ford.,0,25,== Later career ==,45458747
Several tracks co-written with Thompson were released on the Rhythm King label and they scored a hit with Chiki Chiki Ah Ah.,1,25,== Later career ==,45458747
"This song earned a BBC airplay ban due to the lyric ""Disco Me To Ecstasy"" (The song's original title)The partnership with Brian Johnson ended and Thompson formed his own publishing company ST Music.",2,25,== Later career ==,45458747
ST Music now owns many of his early copyrights as well as his post 1980's output.,3,25,== Later career ==,45458747
The first copyrights handled by the new company included two songs recorded by Elkie Brooks for her album Pearls III (Close to the Edge).,4,25,== Later career ==,45458747
"Both songs ""The Last Teardrop"" and ""One of A Kind"" were released as singles the latter in Belgium Only.",5,25,== Later career ==,45458747
