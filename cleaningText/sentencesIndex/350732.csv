"Braxton's notational devices also ensure variation within the primary melody itself, often by the orders they refuse to give: for example, a traditional clef assigns a note to a specific line, but the diamond-shaped ""open clef"" of a GTM composition allows performers to choose any clef or transposition.",8,17,== Compositional style and systems == | === Ghost Trance Music ===,350732
