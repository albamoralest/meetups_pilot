Jianjun He classified Chou's works into two categories: “pentatonic-related” or “variable modes-based” composition.,4,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
Most of Chou's early works are pentatonic-related and Chou drew his inspirations from traditional Chinese pentatonic melodies.,5,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
The piece metaphor (1960) marks the beginning of Chou's middle period when Chou utilized the variable modes as a compositional method to pitch organization.,6,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
"Later, Chou applied the modes to other works such as Cursive (1963), Pien (1966), and Yun (1969).",7,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
Chou stated that the structure of Pien is based on the concept of balance between the positive and the negative forces as stated in I-Ching.,8,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
Ideogram is another evolutionary concept Chou experimented with while attempting to synthesize western and eastern elements and render Chinese sounds through western instruments.,9,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
"Chou is an accomplished calligrapher and after years of practicing the various styles and scripts of Chinese calligraphic writings, Chou began to see the parallels in the art of calligraphy and music.",10,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
"Chou wrote, “The cursive script represents the essence in the art of Chinese calligraphy as its expressiveness depends solely upon the spontaneous but controlled flow of ink which, through the brush – strokes, projects not only fluid lines in interaction but also density, texture and poise....",11,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
"These qualities, translated into musical terms are often found in the music for wind and string instruments of the east.",12,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
Chou compares the ink flow to the density of the music and experimented with the ideograms of cursive style writing in the piece Cursive in 1963.,13,32,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
Chou's later works moved toward abstraction and he further developed the variable mode to make it more flexible.,0,33,== Composition styles and developments == | === Mature period ===,2627858
