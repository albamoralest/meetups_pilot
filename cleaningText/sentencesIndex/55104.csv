"The term musique concrète (French for ""real music"", literally ""concrete music""), was coined by Schaeffer in 1948.",0,22,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Schaeffer believed traditionally classical (or as he called it, ""serious"") music begins as an abstraction (musical notation) that is later produced as audible music.",1,22,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Musique concrète, by contrast, strives to start with the ""concrete"" sounds that emanate from base phenomena and then abstracts them into a composition.",2,22,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"The term musique concrète is then, in essence, the breaking down of the structured production of traditional instruments, harmony, rhythm, and even music theory itself, in an attempt to reconstruct music from the bottom up.",3,22,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"From the contemporary point of view, the importance of Schaeffer's musique concrète is threefold.",0,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
He developed the concept of including any and all sounds into the vocabulary of music.,1,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
At first he concentrated on working with sounds other than those produced by traditional musical instruments.,2,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Later on, he found it was possible to remove the familiarity of musical instrument sounds and abstract them further by techniques such as removing the attack of the recorded sound.",3,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
He was among the first musicians to manipulate recorded sound for the purpose of using it in conjunction with other sounds in order to compose a musical piece.,4,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Techniques such as tape looping and tape splicing were used in his research, often comparing to sound collage.",5,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
The advent of Schaeffer's manipulation of recorded sound became possible only with technologies that were developed after World War II had ended in Europe.,6,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
His work is recognized today as an essential precursor to contemporary sampling practices.,7,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Schaeffer was among the first to use recording technology in a creative and specifically musical way, harnessing the power of electronic and experimental instruments in a manner similar to Luigi Russolo, whom he admired and from whose work he drew inspiration.",8,23,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Furthermore, he emphasized the importance of ""playing"" (in his terms, jeu) in the creation of music.",0,24,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"Schaeffer's idea of jeu comes from the French verb jouer, which carries the same double meaning as the English verb play: 'to enjoy oneself by interacting with one's surroundings', as well as 'to operate a musical instrument'.",1,24,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104
"This notion is at the core of the concept of musique concrète, and reflects on freely improvised sound, or perhaps more specifically electroacoustic improvisation, from the standpoint of Schaeffer's work and research.",2,24,== Legacy == | === Musique concrète ===,55104

"In 1955, Éliane Radigue, an apprentice of Pierre Schaeffer at Studio d'Essai, learned to cut, splice and edit tape using his techniques.",0,26,== Legacy == | === Influences on music ===,55104

"She composed several works (Jouet Electronique [1967], Elemental I [1968], Stress-Osaka [1969], Usral [1969], Ohmnht [1970] Vice Versa, etc [1970]) by processing the feedback between two tape recorders and a microphone.",3,26,== Legacy == | === Influences on music ===,55104

"Pierre Schaeffer distanced himself – voluntarily – from the musical universe in the early 1980s after criticizing the avant-garde of the 1950s, which intended to break with tradition.",8,26,== Legacy == | === Influences on music ===,55104
"Contrary to this view, Schaeffer returns to music when he recognizes the virtuoso Otavio Henrique Soares Brandão as his most faithful disciple, who under his guidance performed a reading of his work ""Traité dos Objets Musicaux"".",9,26,== Legacy == | === Influences on music ===,55104
"This reading aims to create an innovative piano and musical instrumental technique, which does not break with tradition.",10,26,== Legacy == | === Influences on music ===,55104
