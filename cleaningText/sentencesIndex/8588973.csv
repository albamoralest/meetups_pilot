Kollias uses a foot technique in between heel up and heel down.,0,5,== Technique ==,8588973

All the weight of his legs fall on the balls of his feet.,2,5,== Technique ==,8588973
"When playing at slower bpms, Kollias's legs do the vast majority of the movement of a kick, moving up and down as much as the pedal does itself.",3,5,== Technique ==,8588973
"However, as his speed increases, the heels of his feet move less and less, until the bpm is high enough that all the movement of the pedals stems from his ankles.",4,5,== Technique ==,8588973
"Once he gets up to speeds that are this fast, he employs a swivel technique.",5,5,== Technique ==,8588973
"In this technique, he uses his feet to keep count of the beats he has hit, moving his ankles to the right side of the pedal and then swinging them over to the other side of the pedal.",6,5,== Technique ==,8588973
"In this way, as he explains, the extra energy that one's legs waste when they work so hard is utilized.",7,5,== Technique ==,8588973
