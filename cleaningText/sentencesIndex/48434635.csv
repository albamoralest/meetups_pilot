"After their much-cited first article, in 1975, comparing judges' bail-setting decisions in a simulation to those they made in the courtroom, Ebbesen and Konečni published a number of critical methodological articles on the key issue of external validity at many points in the existing research on the legal process, with special reference to jury simulations.",2,11,== Career == | === Legal psychology and judicial decision-making ===,48434635

"In his first article (1976) in psycho-aesthetics, Konečni, influenced by Daniel Berlyne (one of his graduate-school mentors), successfully combined work on physiological arousal with his own prior work on the ""cathartic effect"" to study music preference (as a dependent variable).",1,13,== Career == | === Empirical aesthetics ===,48434635

"In 2005, he published a theoretical article outlining his ""aesthetic trinity theory"" (ATT), in which ""trinity"" refers to a tripartite hierarchical organization of peak aesthetic responses consisting of: (a) physiological thrills (or chills), the most frequent and transient response, and the least pronounced, yet the object of most experimental work; (b) the state of ""being moved"", considered to be intermediate in depth and duration (the linguistic representation and conceptual structure of this state have recently been empirically investigated by Kuehnast et al., 2014); and (c) aesthetic awe, conceptualized as the peak aesthetic response, exceedingly rare and memorable, and similar to the fundamental emotions in terms of physiological fluctuation, but, unlike them, characterized by existential safety, controllability of danger, and the ease with which it can be ""switched off"".",1,30,== Career == | === Peak aesthetic experiences ===,48434635
"In ATT, aesthetic awe is viewed as the prototypical response to the ""sublime stimulus-in-context"" that is external to the perceiver (unlike some positions in philosophy), defined independently of aesthetic awe, and characterized by physical grandeur, great rarity, extraordinary beauty, and novelty, among other criteria).",2,30,== Career == | === Peak aesthetic experiences ===,48434635
