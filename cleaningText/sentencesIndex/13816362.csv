"Although both men wrote memoirs of their collaboration with Gordon, their accounts suggest that Gordon himself was the likely source of many of these contradictory tales, and that he may well have concocted these stories to cover his real activities - although of course his motive for doing so can never be known.",2,2,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"There are also notable periods for which there is little or no information about his whereabouts and activities, such as his mysterious trip to America in 1957–58, including his alleged ""nervous breakdown"" and extended hospitalisation in Hawaii, his movements and activities after final departure from Australia in 1962, and his death in London in 1963.",3,2,== Early life and career ==,13816362

"For unknown reasons, Gordon left America sometime in the mid-1940s and reportedly worked in several 'colourful' overseas business enterprises - in Lima, Peru, he was involved in a direct mail business, and later he moved to Havana, Cuba, where he exported cigars and roses to the United States and booked American acts into the famous Tropicana Club, Havana's famous open-air nightclub.",3,4,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"The dating of his involvement with the Tropicana is uncertain, although it is possible that he was working there during the period that the Miami Mafia took control of the club in 1946.",4,4,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"Accounts of Gordon's activities and whereabouts in the years between his return from Cuba in the late 1940s and his move to Australia in 1953 vividly illustrate the contradictory, probably exaggerated and possibly even fictitious stories that Gordon told about his life.",0,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"In this case, although there are several key elements in common, there are at least three extant versions of his life during this time, each of which differ notably in the details of events and locations.",1,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"According to one version, he opened a chain of sixty ""House of Grams"" and ""House of TV"" retail stores in the US, but his gimmicky sales pitches supposedly angered the powerful US Electrical Retailers' Association, and Gordon was allegedly forced out of business, incurring a heavy financial loss.",2,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362

"However, Gordon told at least two other different versions of this tale to his Australian business associate Max Moore.",4,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"In one account, Gordon claimed that his retail venture was successful, and that he  eventually sold it for US$550,000 (a very considerable amount at that time, and  apparently the largest single sum he ever made during his life) but Gordon further claimed that he had subsequently lost the entire fortune within three years, backing two unsuccessful Broadway productions and several loss-making music tours.",5,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"Although the details cannot be readily confirmed, and may or may not be true, this pattern certainly accords with what is known of Gordon's Australian career, where he repeatedly made and lost small fortunes on his music promotions and other enterprises.",6,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362
"In a third (and perhaps least likely) version of these events, also recounted by Max Moore, Gordon claimed that in early 1953 he accepted a bet from some influential New York business people, who doubted his claims that he could start with nothing and become a success.",7,5,== Early life and career ==,13816362

"Gordon's first Australian business venture was a marketing business utilising the latest American techniques such as telephone quizzes, competitions and discount coupons on to lure customers into a Sydney furniture and electrical appliances retailer, Royal Art Furnishings.",2,7,== Australian career ==,13816362
"His deal with the company gave him a percentage of the increased business, and his marketing tactics proved so successful that the company sold thousands of appliances, earning a considerable sum in a short time.",3,7,== Australian career ==,13816362
"From the springboard of his initial marketing success, Gordon then established himself as a music concert promoter in Australia.",0,8,== Australian career ==,13816362
"Backed by his recent earnings and tapping his connections in the American music business, he founded a promotions company to bring out leading American music artists.",1,8,== Australian career ==,13816362
"He was keen to minimise his tax liability—Australian tax law in those days charged a double rate on performers who worked in both Australia and the United States—so he hired a skilled accountant, Alan Heffernan, who went on to become his permanent accountant and general manager, as well becoming a close friend and confidante.",2,8,== Australian career ==,13816362
Heffernan played a major role in Gordon's subsequent success and he helped to keep the company going through the mysterious period in 1958 when Gordon disappeared for almost a year.,3,8,== Australian career ==,13816362

"Gordon negotiated a deal with venue owners Stadiums Limited for the use of their venues in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, at a cost of AU£500 per session, and arranged the hire of Centennial Hall in Adelaide and suitable venues in other major cities.",3,11,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Stadiums Ltd was a famous Australian company that had been purchased in 1916 by colourful Melbourne business identity John Wren, whose life and career was the inspiration for John West, the central character in Frank Hardy's controversial novel Power Without Glory.",4,11,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Stadiums Ltd owned large venues in most Australian capital cities, including the Sydney Stadium, Melbourne Festival Hall and Brisbane Festival Hall.",5,11,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Through the first half of the 20th century these halls, which were originally built as sporting arenas, had hosted many major Australian boxing and wrestling matches, but they were ideal for Gordon's purposes since their ""in-the-round"" arenas were at the time the largest indoor venues in Australia's three east coast capital cities.",6,11,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Thanks to the deal struck by Gordon, these venues  - especially the Sydney Stadium - became indelibly associated with the ""Big Show"" tours of the 1950s.",7,11,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
The notable except to this was Melbourne.,0,12,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"The first Big Show tours in 1954 and early 1955 were all presented at the old West Melbourne Stadium, but it was destroyed by fire in the early hours of 24 January 1955, just before the last two Melbourne concerts of the first Australian tour by Frank Sinatra, whose shows had to be hastily relocated to the Melbourne Town Hall.",1,12,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"The venue was soon rebuilt as Melbourne Festival Hall and was reopened in mid-1956, in time for the Melbourne Olympic Games, but in the interim Gordon was obliged to use a range of other Melbourne venues including the Town Hall, Leggett's Ballroom in Prahran, the Royal Exhibition Building, and the Palais Theatre in St Kilda, until the Olympics had ended and the new Festival Hall was again available for regular concert bookings.",2,12,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"With the Stadiums deal in place, Gordon refitted the stage at the old Sydney Stadium, installing Australia's first rotating stage, which was placed on top of the old fight ring in the centre of the arena.",0,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Located in Ruschcutters Bay, the Stadium was only a short distance from the Big Show office, but it was far from luxurious.",1,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Locally - and quite accurately - known as ""The Old Tin Shed"", it was a very rudimentary structure by modern standards.",2,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"It was octagonal in shape, with raked wooden seats facing towards the central stage, and it had a maximum capacity of around 11,000.",3,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"It was built with an iron and wood frame rising from a brick base, but the roof and walls were covered in corrugated steel, which was both unlined and uninsulated.",4,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"This created a formidable echo which often made music and lyrics difficult to hear clearly, and although it proved to be well-suited to providing a facsimile of the 'slapback' echo found on many rock'n'roll records, once the audience started screaming, the reverberation made it impossible to hear anything, even on stage.",5,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"At The Beatles' concert there in 1964, one Sydney newspaper sent along a sound engineer, who reportedly monitored the sound level from the hordes of screaming teenyboppers at well over 100 decibels.",6,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Adding to its drawbacks, the building had no air-conditioning or forced ventilation and its metal skin made it both unbearably hot in the sweltering Sydney summer (when many concert tours were scheduled) and deafeningly loud in heavy rain.",7,13,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"The Lee Gordon ""Big Show"" tours were classic mid-20th century variety ""package shows"", starring a major imported performer (usually a singer) as headliner, with several other  imported acts supporting, including singers, dancers and standup comedians.",0,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Because of his extensive connections in his homeland, and the musical trends of the day, virtually all the imported headlining acts on Gordon's Big Show tours were Americans.",1,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Early Big Show lineups did not feature a local support act, but due to both local Musicians Union rules and the high cost (relative to today) of transporting large backing ensembles to Australia from the US, a local orchestra or band was typically employed to provide backing for the visitors.",2,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
For the first four Big Show tours of 1954 the visiting artists were backed by the local Wally Norman Swing Band; Norman was an accomplished jazz trumpet played and arranger who had previously played in the band led by Les Welch.,3,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"For most subsequent tours 1955-59 for which a larger band was required this was provided by an orchestra led by Australian bandleader and arranger Dennis Collinson, who was Lee Gordon's musical director from 1955 until Collinson's death in 1959.",4,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"However, as the rock'n'roll boom grew in popularity and electric instruments came into wider use, there was less and less need for large backing ensembles.",5,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Another significant development over the course of Gordon's career was that, as his promotions began to concentrate more on rock'n'roll, he began to include local rock acts like as supports.",6,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"The first instance came out of necessity when one of Gordon's star attractions -  Gene Vincent - was delayed en route and missed the first two shows of the tour, forcing Gordon to turn to rising local star Johnny O'Keefe and his band The Dee Jays to fill the gap until Vincent and his group arrived; this exposure also proved to be the turning point in O'Keefe's career.",7,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Another notable instance was that of singer Diana Trask, whose inclusion as a support led to her being encouraged to go to America by the tour's headliner Frank Sinatra.",8,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"The presence of local performers on these prestige tours greatly boosted their national popularity, although it sometimes proved to be a double-edged sword for Gordon, because the formidable confidence, showmanship and musical prowess of the local acts (who were also keen to prove their mettle against the imported stars) occasionally upstaged the visiting Americans.",9,14,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Although Gordon's Big Show tours soon came to dominate the market, and he was able to secure the lion's share of the top jazz, pop and rock'n'roll attractions of the period, he did not have the field to himself for long.",0,15,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Only one month after his first promotion, a jazz tour in July 1954, rival Melbourne-based promoter Kenn Brodziak presented his first international music tour, headlined by the famous American jazz drummer Gene Krupa.",1,15,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362
"Brodziak went to promote many other musical tours in competition with Gordon, and in 1964 he famously scored the biggest coup of his long career when he secured The Beatles for their first and only Australian tour.",2,15,== Australian career == | === The Big Show ===,13816362

It was a significant event in many respects.,1,18,"== Australian career == | ==== Ella Fitzgerald/Buddy Rich/Artie Shaw tour, July 1954 ====",13816362

"It was also an historic moment in the career of Artie Shaw - he had visited Australia once before, during WWII, but his 1943 concerts were restricted to service personnel only, so this 1954 tour was to be the first and only chance most local fans had to see him in concert.",3,18,"== Australian career == | ==== Ella Fitzgerald/Buddy Rich/Artie Shaw tour, July 1954 ====",13816362

"Although the Argus report quoted a local spokesperson for Pan-Am, who denied that they had been refused seats because of a ""color bar"", that was indeed the cause - and this was confirmed in December 1954, when Fitzgerald, Henry, Lewis, and Granz jointly filed a civil suit against Pan-Am for racial discrimination.",2,19,"== Australian career == | ==== Ella Fitzgerald/Buddy Rich/Artie Shaw tour, July 1954 ====",13816362

"As a result of the incident, Fitzgerald and her band were stranded in Honolulu for three days until they could board another flight to Australia and they missed the first two concerts of the tour, so Big Show had to organise two additional free shows in Sydney on 30 and 31 July to compensate ticket-holders, and an additional scheduled concert in Newcastle featuring Fitzgerald only also had to be cancelled after she fell ill.",0,20,"== Australian career == | ==== Ella Fitzgerald/Buddy Rich/Artie Shaw tour, July 1954 ====",13816362

"Alongside Fitzgerald's earlier visit these tours marked the first time that African-American jazz performers had toured extensively in Australia as headlining acts since the notorious incident in 1928, when visiting jazz band Sonny Clay's Colored Idea were deported from Australia, after members of the band were allegedly found in 'compromising' situations with white women in their Melbourne accommodation.",1,27,== Australian career == | ==== Louis Armstrong tour ====,13816362
"Since that time, according to Australian jazz historian Andrew Bissett, there had been an effective ban on African American groups entering Australia, and given that the White Australia Policy was still very much in force in 1954, the fact that Gordon was able to pull this tour off was a remarkable feat which merits further investigation.",2,27,== Australian career == | ==== Louis Armstrong tour ====,13816362

"In almost exactly ten years, Lee Gordon's combination of ""style, ego and limitless enthusiasm"" transformed the staid Australian entertainment scene, helped to lay the foundations of the modern Australian music industry, and showed that despite the distances and costs involved, it was possible to mount successful package tours featuring leading American performers.",0,91,== Influence on Australian music ==,13816362

"Except for a few visits during World War II (e.g. a restricted wartime tour by Artie Shaw), virtually none of the top names in American popular music had ever visited Australia before the Gordon tours, due to a combination of factors including distance, cost (compounded by Australia's punitive taxation laws of the time) and particularly because of a long-standing de facto ban on African-American performers.",2,92,== Influence on Australian music ==,13816362

"This was a major breakthrough in Australia because, as jazz historian Andrew Bissett has noted, the selective government application of the White Australia Policy  (spurred by ongoing pressure from the Australian Musicians' Union) had effectively prevented any African-American performers artists from touring Australia since the controversial deportation of the African-American jazz band Sonny Clay's Colored Idea in 1928.",1,93,== Influence on Australian music ==,13816362
