"The Log was built after-hours by Paul at the Epiphone guitar factory, and is one of the first solid-body electric guitars.",2,11,== Career == | === Guitar builder ===,145712
"For the sake of appearance, he attached the body of an Epiphone hollow-body guitar sawn lengthwise with The Log in the middle.",3,11,== Career == | === Guitar builder ===,145712
"This solved his two main problems: feedback, as the acoustic body no longer resonated with the amplified sound, and sustain, as the energy of the strings was not dissipated in generating sound through the guitar body.",4,11,== Career == | === Guitar builder ===,145712

"In 1946,  his mother complimented him on a song she had heard on the radio, when in fact she had heard George Barnes, not Paul.",1,17,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"This motivated Paul to spend two years in his Hollywood garage recording studio, creating his unique sound, his New Sound.",2,17,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712

"After a recording session, Bing Crosby suggested that Paul build a recording studio so he could produce the sound he wanted.",1,18,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
Paul started his studio in the garage of his home on North Curson Street in Hollywood.,2,18,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712

"He recorded a track onto a disk, then recorded himself playing another part with the first.",10,18,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
He built the multitrack recording with overlaid tracks rather than parallel ones as he did later.,11,18,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712

"Years later in his Hollywood garage, he used the acetate disc setup to record parts at different speeds and with delay, resulting in his signature sound with echoes and birdsong-like guitar riffs.",1,19,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"In 1949, Crosby gave Paul one of the first Ampex Model 200A reel to reel tape recorders.",0,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"Paul invented sound on sound recording using this machine by placing an additional playback head, located before the conventional erase/record/playback heads.",1,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"This allowed Paul to play along with a previously recorded track, both of which were mixed together onto a new track.",2,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"The Ampex was a monophonic tape recorder with only one track across the entire width of quarter-inch tape, and therefore, the recording was ""destructive"" in the sense that the original recording was permanently replaced with the new, mixed recording.",3,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
He eventually enhanced this by using one tape machine to play back the original recording and a second to record the combined track.,4,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
This preserved the original recording.,5,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"In 1952, Paul invented the flange effect, where a sound phases in and out in harmonic tone.",6,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
"The first example of this can be heard on his song ""Mammy's Boogie"".",7,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
Observing film recordings inspired Paul to design the stacking of eight tape recorders.,8,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712
He worked with Ross Snyder on the design of the first eight-track recording deck built for him by Ampex for his home studio.,9,20,== Career == | === Multitrack recording ===,145712

The songs were recorded with multiple tracks where Ford harmonized with herself and Paul played multiple layers of guitars.,1,23,== Career == | === Les Paul and Mary Ford ===,145712
They used the recording technique known as close miking where the microphone is less than 6 inches (15 cm) from the singer's mouth.,0,24,== Career == | === Les Paul and Mary Ford ===,145712
"This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when a singer is 1 foot (30 cm) or more from the microphone.",1,24,== Career == | === Les Paul and Mary Ford ===,145712
"When using a pressure-gradient (uni- or bi-directional) microphone, it emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice due to the microphone's proximity effect and gives a more relaxed feel because the performer is not working as hard.",2,24,== Career == | === Les Paul and Mary Ford ===,145712
The result is a singing style which diverged from the unamplified theater style of the musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.,3,24,== Career == | === Les Paul and Mary Ford ===,145712
