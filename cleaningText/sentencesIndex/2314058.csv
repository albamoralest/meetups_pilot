"Salome's dance in St John the Baptist was praised for its avoidance of the salacious: ""The whole of the scene is very cleverly worked out, and the composer has avoided anything inappropriate in the music descriptive of the dance, that might be considered out of place in an oratorio.""",4,89,== Reputation ==,2314058
"Others, however, criticized the oratorio, arguing that ""with all its very great and solid merit, can be said to be original in style only in virtue of the logical results of certain theories of harmony held by its composer.""",5,89,== Reputation ==,2314058
"By the early twentieth century, Macfarren's works were no longer performed, a fact which the Worshipful Company of Musicians attributed to a lack of genius on Macfarren's part: ""Never was more earnest composer, more prolific writer; never did man strive more zealously for the art of his country; yet Heaven had endowed him only with talent and not genius.",6,89,== Reputation ==,2314058

"However, Macfarren's St John the Baptist has been praised as ""an original and imaginative piece in which the shadow of Mendelssohn, so prominent since the appearance of Elijah in 1846, is only occasionally perceptible.""",10,89,== Reputation ==,2314058
