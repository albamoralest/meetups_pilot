"With Aimé Césaire and Léon Damas, Senghor created the concept of Négritude, an important intellectual movement that sought to assert and to valorise what they believed to be distinctive African characteristics, values, and aesthetics.",0,83,== Négritude ==,172067
"One of these African characteristics that Senghor theorised was asserted when he wrote ""the Negro has reactions that are more lived, in the sense that they are more direct and concrete expressions of the sensation and of the stimulus, and so of the object itself with all its original qualities and power.""",1,83,== Négritude ==,172067
"This was a reaction against the too strong dominance of French culture in the colonies, and against the perception that Africa did not have culture developed enough to stand alongside that of Europe.",2,83,== Négritude ==,172067
In that respect négritude owes significantly to the pioneering work of Leo Frobenius.,3,83,== Négritude ==,172067
"Building upon historical research identifying ancient Egypt with black Africa, Senghor argued that sub-Saharan Africa and Europe are in fact part of the same cultural continuum, reaching from Egypt to classical Greece, through Rome to the European colonial powers of the modern age.",0,84,== Négritude ==,172067
"Négritude was by no means—as it has in many quarters been perceived—an anti-white racism, but rather emphasised the importance of dialogue and exchange among different cultures (e.g., European, African, Arab, etc.).",1,84,== Négritude ==,172067
