"Her songs deal mostly with the universal themes of love, longing and loss.",17,7,== Professional career ==,214221
A typical Umm Kulthum concert consisted of the performance of two or three songs over a period of three to four hours.,18,7,== Professional career ==,214221
"These performances are in some ways reminiscent of the structure of Western opera, consisting of long vocal passages linked by shorter orchestral interludes.",19,7,== Professional career ==,214221
"However, Umm Kulthum was not stylistically influenced by opera, and she sang solo most of her career.",20,7,== Professional career ==,214221
During the 1930s her repertoire took the first of several specific stylistic directions.,0,8,== Professional career ==,214221

"Umm Kulthum's musical directions in the 1940s and early 1950s and her mature performing style led this period to becoming popularly known as ""the golden age"" of Umm Kulthum.",0,10,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"In keeping with changing popular taste as well as her own artistic inclinations, in the early 1940s, she requested songs from composer Zakariya Ahmad and colloquial poet Mahmud Bayram el-Tunsi cast in styles considered to be indigenously Egyptian.",1,10,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"This represented a dramatic departure from the modernist romantic songs of the 1930s, mainly led by Mohammad El-Qasabgi.",2,10,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
Umm Kulthum had abstained from singing Qasabgi's music since the early 1940s.,3,10,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Their last stage song collaboration in 1941 was ""Raq el Habib"" (""The lover's heart softens""), one of her most popular, intricate, and high-caliber songs.",4,10,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
The reason for the separation is not clear.,0,11,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"It is speculated that this was due in part to the popular failure of the movie Aida, in which Umm Kulthum sings mostly Qasabgi's compositions, including the first part of the opera.",1,11,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Qasabgi was experimenting with Arabic music, under the influence of classical European music, and was composing a lot for Asmahan, a singer who immigrated to Egypt from Syria and was the only serious competitor for Umm Kulthum before Asmahan's death in a car accident in 1944.",2,11,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Simultaneously, Umm Kulthum started to rely heavily on a younger composer who joined her artistic team a few years earlier: Riad Al-Sunbati.",0,12,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"While Sonbati was evidently influenced by Qasabgi in those early years, the melodic lines he composed were more lyrical and more acceptable to Umm Kulthum's audience.",1,12,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
The result of collaborations with Rami/Sonbati and al-Tunisi/Ahmad was a populist and popular repertoire that had lasting appeal for the Egyptian audience.,2,12,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"In 1946, Umm Kulthum defied all odds by presenting a religious poem in classical Arabic.",0,13,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Salou Qalbi [""Ask My Heart""] was written by Ahmad Shawqi and composed by Ryad Al Sunbati.",1,13,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
The success was immediate and it reconnected Umm Kulthum with her early singing years.,2,13,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Similar poems written by Shawqi were subsequently composed by Sonbati and sung by Umm Kulthum, including Woulida el Houda [""The Prophet is Born""] 1949), in which she surprised royalists by singing a verse that describes the Prophet Mohammad as ""the Imam of Socialists"".",3,13,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"At the peak of her career, in 1950, Umm Kulthum sang Sonbati's composition of excerpts of what Ahmad Rami considered the accomplishment of his career: the translation from Persian into classical Arabic of Omar Khayyám's quatrains (Rubayyiat el Khayyam).",0,14,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
The song included quatrains that deal with both epicurianism and redemption.,1,14,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Ibrahim Nagi's poem ""Al-Atlal"" [""The Ruins""] was sung by Umm Kalthum in a personal version and in a melody composed by Sonbati and premiered in 1966, is considered a signature song of hers.",2,14,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"As Umm Kulthum's vocal abilities had regressed considerably by then, the song can be viewed as the last example of genuine Arabic music at a time when even Umm Kulthum had started to compromise by singing Western-influenced pieces composed by her old rival Mohammed Abdel Wahab.",3,14,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"The duration of Umm Kulthum's songs in performance was not fixed as upon the audience request for more repetitions, she would repeat the lines requested at length and her performances usually lasted for up to five hours, during which three songs were sung.",0,15,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"For example, the available live performances (about 30) of Ya Zalemni, one of her most popular songs, varied in length from 45 to 90 minutes, depending on both her creative mood for improvisations, illustrating the dynamic relationship between the singer and the audience as they fed off each other's emotional energy.",1,15,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"An improvisatory technique, which was typical of old classical Arabic singing, and which she executed for as long as she could have (both her regressing vocal abilities with age and the increased Westernization of Arabic music became an impediment to this art), was to repeat a single line or stance over and over, subtly altering the emotive emphasis and intensity and exploring one or various musical modal scales (maqām) each time to bring her audiences into a euphoric and ecstatic state known in Arabic as ""tarab"" طرب.",2,15,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Her concerts used to broadcast from Thursday 9.30 P.M., until the early morning hours on Friday.",3,15,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"The spontaneous creativity of Umm Kulthum as a singer is most impressive when, upon listening to these many different renditions of the same song over a time span of five years (1954–1959), the listener is offered a totally unique and different experience.",0,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"This intense, highly personalized relationship was undoubtedly one of the reasons for Umm Kulthum's tremendous success as an artist.",1,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
Worth noting though that the length of a performance did not necessarily reflect either its quality or the improvisatory creativity of Umm Kulthum.,2,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Around 1965, Umm Kulthum started collaborating with composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab.",3,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"Her first song composed by Abdel Wahab, Enta Omri [""you are my life""].",4,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
"According to André Chouraqui, in May 1967, just before the Six-Day War, she was heard on Radio Cairo and Radio Damas singing ""Slaughter, slaughter, slaughter and have no pity ..."" toward the Zionist Israelis.",5,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
Another source mentions the creation of a song of war.,6,16,== Professional career == | === Golden age ===,214221
