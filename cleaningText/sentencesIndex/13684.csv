Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery.,13,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners, mainly women, rarely wrote in Latin.",14,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"Her writings were commentated on by Mélanie Lipinska, a Polish scientist.",15,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"In addition to its wealth of practical evidence, Causae et Curae is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme.",16,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.",17,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the ""green"" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person.",18,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"Viriditas, or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.",19,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy.",20,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684

"In this section, she gives specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like ""the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp"").",23,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684

"As Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: ""the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.""",30,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
"Although she inherited the basic framework of humoral theory from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to ""superior"" and ""inferior"" elements – blood and phlegm corresponding to the ""celestial"" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the ""terrestrial"" elements of water and earth.",31,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors.,32,29,== Works == | === Scientific and medicinal writings ===,13684
