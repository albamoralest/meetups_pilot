If I knew what I know now I probably would have switched.,0,9,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"At the time I had already been playing two or three years, and it seemed like I had been playing a long time.",1,9,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736

"I did have a go at it, but I just didn't have the patience.",4,9,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736

He ultimately decided to continue playing left-handed.,0,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle – ""melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger"" – and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems.",1,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them.",2,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"Second, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings to make it easier to do so.",3,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970–71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings.",4,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos.",5,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles ""helped with his technique"" because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident.",6,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on ""Children of the Grave"", ""Lord of this World"", and ""Into the Void"", all on the album Master of Reality).",7,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
"Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a ""bigger, heavier sound"", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them.",8,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
Iommi reflected in 2016 saying that his greatest regret is losing his fingertips.,9,10,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
It became a burden.,0,11,== Early life == | === Accident ===,395736
