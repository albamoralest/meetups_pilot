"A similar effect could be obtained in playback by merely taking an LP recorded at 331⁄3 RPM and playing it back at 45 or 78 RPM, a trick sometimes tried out by ordinary record listeners.",2,43,== Recording technique ==,355901
"The instrumental portions of the song are sped up as well, however, making it obvious that the music is being played at the wrong speed.",3,43,== Recording technique ==,355901
Bagdasarian recorded vocals and music at different speeds to combine properly on his recording.,4,43,== Recording technique ==,355901

"The early production style of hip-hop artist Kanye West involved sped-up, high-pitch vocal samples from classic soul records incorporated with his own (additional) instrumentation.",11,43,== Recording technique ==,355901
"Due in part to the acclaim of his debut album The College Dropout, such sampling techniques subsequently became much copied by a myriad of other hip-hop producers.",12,43,== Recording technique ==,355901
"In the early 1990s rave scene, many breakbeat hardcore productions would utilize the same studio tricks, often taking a cappella from house records and speeding them up to fit the faster tempo.",13,43,== Recording technique ==,355901
"Vocals in songs that used this method would typically be referred to as ""chipmunk vocals"".",14,43,== Recording technique ==,355901
