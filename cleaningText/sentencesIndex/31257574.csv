This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones.,4,8,== Automixer ==,31257574
"The microphones were ""continuously and automatically adjusted"" by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones.",5,8,== Automixer ==,31257574
"Dugan's patent application for a ""Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems"" was accepted and published on June 4, 1974.",6,8,== Automixer ==,31257574
"This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.",7,8,== Automixer ==,31257574
"Though the algorithm was good, the reference microphone was an unpredictable variable: it had practical placement problems.",0,9,== Automixer ==,31257574
"If it was near the audience, audience noise would skew the algorithm.",1,9,== Automixer ==,31257574

"In the late 1980s, Dugan developed a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm.",3,10,== Automixer ==,31257574
The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and presented to the 87th AES convention in October.,4,10,== Automixer ==,31257574
"Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time.",5,10,== Automixer ==,31257574
"The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs.",6,10,== Automixer ==,31257574
"The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers.",7,10,== Automixer ==,31257574
"An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U rack unit handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.",8,10,== Automixer ==,31257574

"In September 2006, Dugan produced the Model E, the E standing for economy.",5,11,== Automixer ==,31257574
This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller and less expensive than previous ones.,6,11,== Automixer ==,31257574
It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could be mounted side-by-side in only 1U of rack space.,7,11,== Automixer ==,31257574
"The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs.",8,11,== Automixer ==,31257574
"Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.",9,11,== Automixer ==,31257574
"In February 2011, Dugan demonstrated an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha digital mixer such as the O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D.
