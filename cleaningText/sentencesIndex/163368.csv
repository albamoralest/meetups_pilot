"In 1984, at the final preview of Starlight Express, Crawford happened to run into the show's creator, Andrew Lloyd Webber.",0,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
Lloyd Webber had met Crawford socially several times and remembered him from his work in Flowers for Algernon.,1,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
He informed Crawford that he was working on a new project based on a Gaston Leroux novel and wanted to know whether he was interested.,2,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
"Crawford said he was, but the show was still in the early planning stages, and nothing had been decided.",3,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368

"Crawford was turned off by that, supposing the songwriter had chosen to do a ""rock opera""-inspired spectacle in lieu of a more traditional operatic musical.",5,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
"Since casting Harley, however, Lloyd Webber had also begun to regret his artistic choices (as stated in the 'Behind the Mask' documentary that he and Cameron MackIntosh agreed that Harley wasn't an actor, nor a large theatre presence, all of which by this point Crawford had vast experience in).",6,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
"As production continued on the show, the bulk of the score was revealing itself to be far more classical and operatic, entirely unsuited to Harley's rough, contemporary voice.",7,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
"Wanting instead a performer with a more classic, melodic voice, as described in the original book, he began yet another search for the perfect actor to play his Phantom.",8,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
Crawford's landing of the role was due in large part to the coincidence that Sarah Brightman had taken lessons with the same vocal coach as Crawford.,9,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
"She and her husband had arrived early for her lesson, and it was while waiting that they chanced to hear Crawford practising the aria Care Selve, from the opera Atalanta by Handel.",10,24,== Acting career == | ==== The Phantom of the Opera ====,163368
