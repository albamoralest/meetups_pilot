"Parncutt's research addresses the perception of musical structure (pitch, consonance, harmony, tonality, tension, rhythm, meter, accent), the psychology of music performance (especially piano performance), and the psychological origins of tonality.",0,4,== Research ==,38041454

"The psychoacoustic model of harmony proposed by Parncutt in 1989 was adapted from the more general pitch algorithm of Ernst Terhardt, published in 1982.",0,6,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"The model assumes that the auditory system treats all acoustic input similarly, whether it is a single tone or a musical chord.",1,6,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"That is, the ""input"" to the model is a spectrum that can be a single complex tone, or any simultaneity such as a chord.",2,6,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"The psychoacoustic effects of auditory masking are then taken into account before a ""template"" of the harmonic series is compared with the input spectrum.",3,6,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"In Parncutt's approach, this comparison yields a number of properties of the sound, including tonalness, multiplicity, and salience.",0,7,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
Tonalness is the degree to which a sound evokes the sensation of a single pitch.,1,7,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"Individual tones, octave dyads, and major chords are quite high in tonalness.",2,7,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
Multiplicity the number of tones a listener spontaneously hears in the sound.,3,7,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"Intriguingly, for most chords the multiplicity values are less than the actual number of constituent tones – a prediction that has been validated empirically.",4,7,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
Pitch salience is the clarity or prominence of a pitch sensation.,0,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
The root of a major chord in root position has greater pitch salience than other tones in that chord.,1,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"Empirical research has confirmed the prediction that typical musical chords evoke pitch classes of low salience that are not notated; for example, the A-minor triad ACE evokes F and D. Parncutt also considers how we perceive successions of sounds, such as chord progressions.",2,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
He argues that the tonic (or main psychological pitch reference) in major-minor music is generally a chord rather than a tone or a scale; the theory is consistent with Heinrich Schenker's idea that a passage of a music is a prolongation of its tonic triad as well as Carol Krumhansl's key profiles.,3,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"Theoretical considerations of the consonance and dissonance of individual tones in unaccompanied melody, when perceived relative to a prevailing diatonic scale, can explain why leading tones in tonal music tend to rise rather than fall.",4,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
His research has also yielded testable predictions about the consonance and dissonance of musical sonorities.,5,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"In a psychoacoustic approach, the consonance/dissonance of a chord (or harmonic sonority) in Western music is a combination of three quasi-independent factors: roughness (originating in the inner ear), harmonicity (originating in the brain), and familiarity (a cultural aspect).",6,8,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"Underlying this research is the idea that a musical interval is a fundamentally psychocultural entity—not a mathematical or physical one, as has often been assumed in the history of music theory.",0,9,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454
"The size of a musical interval—and hence good musical intonation—is generally variable, approximate, context-dependent, and learned from musical experience; it typically deviates systematically from theoretical frequency ratios.",1,9,== Research == | === Pitch and harmony ===,38041454

"In research on the origins of music, Parncutt suggested that the emotional connotations of pitch-time-movement patterns in music originated from the relationship between a mother and her fetus or infant.",0,11,== Research == | === Origins of music ===,38041454
"Research on ""motherese"", or infant-directed speech, already suggests that the mother–infant relationship could account for aspects of the origin of music, since this kind of communication is similar to music in many respects (melody, rhythm, movement).",1,11,== Research == | === Origins of music ===,38041454
"The emotional vocabulary of motherese could in part be learned before birth as the fetus is exposed to the internal sounds of the mother's body (voice, heartbeat, footsteps, digestion), all of which depend on the emotional state of the mother.",2,11,== Research == | === Origins of music ===,38041454

"An objective argument...a conservative conclusion"" dated 25 October 2012, Parncutt, after declaring his fundamental opposition to the death penalty in all cases including mass murderers such as Anders Behring Breivik, proposed restricting the death penalty to individuals who cause more than one million deaths, and claimed that influential ""global warming deniers"" could fall into that category if they slow progress toward reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and thereby cause the deaths of millions of future people.",1,16,== Political views == | === Climate activism ===,38041454

"Parncutt continued that if the death penalty were limited to individuals causing more than one million deaths it might also apply to popes since the 1980s, whom he claimed to be responsible for millions of AIDS deaths for their failure to change the church's position on contraception in the 1980s and subsequently.",0,17,== Political views == | === Climate activism ===,38041454
