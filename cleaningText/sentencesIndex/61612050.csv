"No microphones were needed for lead guitar or bass guitar, which had their own amplifiers.",12,9,== Hendrix and more ==,61612050

"This was not enough for drummer Mitch Mitchell to hear the vocals and his own drums, so in the second half of 1968, when Hendrix started another tour, Jacob augmented the sound system with four self-powered speakers behind the drummer: four Altec 1604B cabinets.",14,9,== Hendrix and more ==,61612050
This helped Mitchell hear himself over the loud guitar amplifiers.,15,9,== Hendrix and more ==,61612050

"Back at McCune, John Meyer had been hired at the request of Harry Jr to create a 3-way loudspeaker for concerts.",24,9,== Hendrix and more ==,61612050
"By early 1972 the revolutionary JM3 system was ready, named for Meyer but with electronic processing by both Meyer and Cavin.",25,9,== Hendrix and more ==,61612050

"From his experience at Hair, Jacob recognized that the technology for wireless microphones was not yet advanced enough for multiple units working at the same time.",9,14,== Broadway == | === Jesus Christ Superstar ===,61612050

Jacob participated in the earliest discussions about staging and choreography; the first time sound design was integrated from the beginning.,1,18,== Broadway == | === Pippin ===,61612050
"For Pippin, Jacob used shotgun microphones as foot mics, overhead area mics and scenery spot mics.",2,18,== Broadway == | === Pippin ===,61612050

"Jacob designed the sound to include unseen, offstage performers for some parts, and he specified a Mellotron keyboard sampler fitted with tape loops of pre-recorded arrangements such as cello and brass parts, the backwards tape sounds emulating ""I Am the Walrus"", and musique concrète elements to mimic the Beatles' sound collage ""Revolution 9"".",9,20,== Broadway == | === Beatles music ===,61612050
"Jacob specified that the piccolo trumpet part in ""Penny Lane"" would be panned around the room to four speaker locations, an enhancement to the Beatles' stereo recording.",10,20,== Broadway == | === Beatles music ===,61612050
"To produce the uniquely repetitive ""Shuk-k-ka"" sound at the beginning of ""Come Together"", Jacob and New York sound mixer Larry Spurgeon used an Eventide Harmonizer set to delay mode to work out a method which must be repeated by hand at every performance.",11,20,== Broadway == | === Beatles music ===,61612050

"Jacob consulted with ex-McCune loudspeaker designer John Meyer to arrive at an appropriate loudspeaker arrangement of four JM3 mains per side plus additional McCune SM3 surround speakers, and he pushed hard to get the mixing console placed in the center of the main audience seating area, just like a modern rock concert.",13,20,== Broadway == | === Beatles music ===,61612050
"Producers were loath to lose these premium seats which would otherwise hold paying customers, but it gave the sound board operator much finer control over the sound balance, and Fisher backed Jacob in this successful demand.",14,20,== Broadway == | === Beatles music ===,61612050

Jacob bounced between Philadelphia and New York for six weeks.,1,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050

This was the first time that a wireless microphone was hidden at the hairline – a now-common technique popularized in 1985 when Andrew Bruce pioneered a large-scale implementation for all of the principal performers in the original London cast of Les Misérables.,3,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"Jacob was asked to bring a more subdued, naturalistic tone to A Chorus Line which was supposed to look like an audition-in-progress for most of the show.",4,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"Jacob put a row of shotgun mics at the front edge of the stage, and Bennett devised a choreography to fit the very visible microphone positions.",5,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"The show opened at The Public Theater off Broadway, where there was no orchestra pit, and the offstage band was squeezed into the loading dock to which Jacob had applied soundproofing.",6,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"With success off Broadway, the show was moved to the Shubert Theatre to open in July 1975.",7,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
Jacob augmented the setup with more shotgun microphones to pick up sounds from mid-stage and upstage (the rear of the stage).,8,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
An offstage vocal booth was added for two singers whose voices were subtly mixed into chorus numbers.,9,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050

The Shubert's orchestra pit was covered in acoustically transparent black gauze to help the audience forget the presence of the band.,11,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"Jacob wanted to use four McCune JM3 loudspeakers but the rental cost was nixed by the producer, and Altec 9846 self-powered cabinets were used instead, powered in this case by distant amplifiers so that the sound crew could more easily correct a potential amplifier problem.",12,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"Two 16-channel stereo mixers were specified by Jacob, custom made by Louis Stevenson of Houston.",13,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"The orchestra was mixed on one of them, with the results patched into the second Stevenson as a stereo stem, for blending with the vocal and area mics.",14,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"Main loudspeakers were positioned at two levels, mezzanine and orchestra, augmented by stereo pairs of under-balcony and upper balcony speakers.",15,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050

This temporary lowering of the venue's noise floor provided extra psychological tension.,19,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
"A Chorus Line was such a success that two more companies were assembled, one traveling to San Francisco and then settling in Los Angeles, the other traveling to Toronto and then settling in London.",20,22,== Broadway == | === A Chorus Line ===,61612050
