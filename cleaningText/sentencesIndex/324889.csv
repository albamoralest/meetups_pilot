In the Revue musicale issue of 1 February 1835 he wrote of the Symphonie Fantastique:,2,21,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"I saw that melody was antipathetic to him, that he only had a faint notion of rhythm; that his harmony, formed by an often monstrous accretion of notes, was nevertheless flat and monotonous; in a word I saw that he lacked melodic and harmonic ideas, and I judged that he would always write in a barbarous manner; but I saw that he had the instinct for instrumentation, and I thought that he could fulfil a useful vocation in discovering certain combinations that others would put to better use than he.",0,22,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"Berlioz, who had proof-read Fétis' editions of the first eight Beethoven symphonies for the publisher Troupenas, commented that",0,23,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
[Fétis had altered Beethoven's harmonies] with unbelievable complacency.,0,24,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"Opposite the E flat which the clarinet sustains over a chord of the sixth (D flat, F, B flat) in the andante of the C minor symphony, Fétis had naively written ‘This E flat must be F. Beethoven could not have possibly made so gross a blunder.'",1,24,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"In other words, a man like Beethoven could not possibly fail to be in entire agreement with the harmonic theories of M. Fétis.",2,24,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"Troupenas did in fact remove Fétis' editorial marks, but Berlioz was still unsatisfied.",0,25,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"He went on to criticize Fétis in one of the monologues of Lélio, ou le Retour à la vie, the 1832 sequel to Symphonie Fantastique:",1,25,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889
"These young theorists of eighty, living in the midst of a sea of prejudices and persuaded that the world ends with the shores of their island; these old libertines of every age who demand that music caress and amuse them, never admitting that the chaste muse could have a more noble mission; especially these desecrators who dare lay hands on original works, subjecting them to horrible mutilations that they call corrections and perfections, which, they say, require considerable taste.",0,26,== Fétis and Berlioz ==,324889

"In 1841 he put together the first history of harmonic theory, his Esquisse de l'histoire de l'harmonie.",1,29,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Assembled from individual articles that Fétis published in the Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris around 1840, the book predates Hugo Riemann's more well known Geschichte der Musiktheorie by fifty years.",2,29,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"The Esquisse, as the title implies, is a general outline rather than an exhaustive study.",3,29,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Fétis is attempting to show the ""facts, errors, and truths"" of previous theories and theorists, as he interprets them, in order to provide a solid grounding for other scholars and to prevent subsequent interpretive mistakes.",4,29,== Theoretical work ==,324889
Fétis' main theoretical work and the culmination of his conceptual frameworks of tonality and harmony is the Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l'harmonie of 1844.,0,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"This book has influenced later theorists and composers including Paul Hindemith, Ernst Kurth, and Franz Liszt.",1,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"In the Musik-Lexicon of 1882, Hugo Riemann states that ""to [Fétis'] meditations we are indebted for the modern concept of tonality…he found himself emancipated from the spirit of a particular age, and able to render justice to all the various styles of music.""",2,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Though some other theorists, most notably Matthew Shirlaw, have had decidedly negative views, Riemann's assessment captures the two key features of Fétis' text.",3,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Though he did not coin the term ""tonality,"" Fétis developed the concept into its present-day form.",4,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"He claimed that ""tonalité"" is the primary organizing agent of all melodic and harmonic successions and that the efforts of other theorists to find the fundamental principle of music in ""acoustics, mathematics, aggregations of intervals, or classifications of chords have been futile.",5,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"""The majority of the Traité complet is devoted to explaining how tonalité organizes music.",6,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
The primary factor of determining tonality is the scale.,7,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"It sets out the order of the succession of tones in major and minor (the only two ""tonal"" modes which he recognizes), the distances which separate the tones, and the resultant melodic and harmonic tendencies.",8,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Tonality is not only a governed and conditioned state, but it is a socially conditioned one.",9,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Scales are cultural manifestations, resulting from shared experience and education.",10,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"Nature provides the elements of tonalité, but human understanding, sensibility, and will determine particular harmonic systems.",11,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889
"This concept was called a ""Metaphysical principle"" by Fétis, though Dahlhaus argues that the term is used in this case to denote an anthropological, culturally relative sense in his 1990 book Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality, and theorist Rosalie Schellhous posits that the Kantian term ""transcendental"" might be more appropriate.",12,30,== Theoretical work ==,324889

"However, if one wishes to interpret Fétis' metaphysical theory, one of his unique theoretical ideas is laid out in book 3 of the Traité complet, that of harmonic modulation.",0,32,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Fétis argues that tonality has evolved over the course of time through four distinct phases, or ordres:",1,32,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Unitonic – Resulting from plainchant tonality, the unitonic phase consists mainly of consonant triads with no possibility for modulation due to the lack of the tritone between the 4th and 7th scale degrees.",0,33,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
This phase is also referred to by Fétis as tonalité ancienne.,1,33,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Transitonic – Order which began with the introduction of the dominant 7th chord into harmonic discourse, sometime between Zarlino and Montverdi.",0,34,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
This development is also directly related to the codification of cadential systems and periodic phrase structure.,1,34,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
Pluritonic – Modulation is achieved through enharmonic relationships in which one note of a chord is considered the point of contact between different scales.,0,35,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
Fétis claims that Mozart was the first to use such modulations as a means of expression.,1,35,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"In this order, the diminished 7th and augmented 6th chords become important as they can modulate to several different tonalities.",2,35,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Omnitonic – The final phase of tonality, and one embodied for Fétis by Wagner, where the alteration of the intervals of natural chords and modification by substitution of notes is so complex that it becomes impossible to identify the original chord.",0,36,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"This is seen as a period of extremes, and undesirable compared to the moderately chromatic music of Meyerbeer.",1,36,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Fétis later applied this same system of ordres to rhythm, ""the least advanced part of music...[where] great things remain to be discovered.""",2,36,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Though he did not publish these theories in any of his treatises, they appear in several articles for the Revue musicale and in some lectures which had a profound impact on Liszt.",3,36,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Though music had not yet made it past the first phase, Unirhythm, by Fétis' time, he argues that composers may be able to ""mutate"" from one meter to another within the same melodic phrase.",4,36,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
"Though Liszt may have been an open disciple of the ideas of the Omnitonic and Omnirhythmic, the influence of such thinking can perhaps be seen most clearly in the music of Brahms, where hemiola and mixing of time signatures is a common occurrence.",5,36,== Theoretical work == | === Harmonic and rhythmic modulation ===,324889
