"After college, Stewart moved to New York where he quickly built his reputation, first gaining wider recognition in John Scofield's quartet with pianist Michael Eckroth and bassist Ben Street and in a trio with Larry Goldings and Peter Bernstein, which has become the longest-running group Stewart has played with, having begun in 1989 and continuing to this day, however infrequently the group may be found in performance.",0,3,== Biography ==,2076912
Stewart's musical horizons expanded when funk saxophonist Maceo Parker tapped the budding drummer upon seeing him with Larry Goldings at a regular gig at a club in Manhattan.,1,3,== Biography ==,2076912

"As a drummer, Bill Stewart's playing is distinguished by its melodic focus, and its polyrhythmic, or layered character.",0,5,== Musical style ==,2076912
"To describe someone's drumming style as ""melodic"" would mean there is a sense that you could ""hum along"" with discernible linear phrases which tell pieces of a story, akin to a vocalist, pianist, or saxophonist.",1,5,== Musical style ==,2076912
Stewart's improvisations favor the development and layering of motivic ideas over the raw generation of excitement or display of technical prowess.,2,5,== Musical style ==,2076912
"Stewart has great touch, or dynamic precision, so that his ideas are articulated with an exactness and clarity.",3,5,== Musical style ==,2076912
"He has also achieved a very high degree of independence of his limbs, so that not only the ride cymbal and the snare/toms, but also the bass drum and hi-hat, are free to participate as melodic ""first-class citizens.""",4,5,== Musical style ==,2076912
"His drumming bears the influence of various melodic drummers who preceded him, including Max Roach, Art Blakey, Joe Morello, Roy Haynes, Jack DeJohnette, Paul Motian, and Al Foster.",5,5,== Musical style ==,2076912

"In other words, his tunes have a bit of an avant-garde flavor.",1,6,== Musical style ==,2076912
"The melodies, harmonies, phrase lengths, and measure lengths are often altered so as not to conform too closely to traditional jazz language.",2,6,== Musical style ==,2076912
"Some of his tunes (such as ""Mayberry"") also feature a built-in ""free blowing"" section, surrounded by a composed ""head"" (in the case of ""Mayberry"", a parody of the theme song of the Andy Griffith Show.)",3,6,== Musical style ==,2076912
"The concept of ""Mayberry"" may have been borrowed from Stewart's long-time collaborator John Scofield, who has written many tunes of the same general shape.",4,6,== Musical style ==,2076912

"Stewart, for the most part, plays holding his sticks in a matched grip, favored by orchestral and rock players.",0,8,== Technique ==,2076912
This is in contrast to many jazz contemporaries who still prefer the traditional grip.,1,8,== Technique ==,2076912
"Stewart grips the stick tighter than most when playing the ride, which helps him to achieve his signature cymbal sound.",0,9,== Technique ==,2076912

"Stewart has a considerable output as a leader, beginning with 1989's Think Before You Think, with bassist Dave Holland, pianist Marc Copland, and saxophonist Joe Lovano, on which the drummer led a session of originals and standards, including one of his own compositions.",0,11,== As a leader ==,2076912
"In his next outing as a leader, Stewart assembled trumpeter Eddie Henderson, saxophonist Lovano, pianist Bill Carrothers and bassist Larry Grenadier for an entire record of Stewart compositions, Snide Remarks, which was chosen as one of the top ten jazz CDs of the year by Peter Watrous of The New York Times.",0,12,== As a leader ==,2076912
"The second Blue Note album to be released under Stewart's name was 1997's Telepathy, featuring Carrothers and Grenadier along with saxophonists Steve Wilson and Seamus Blake.",0,13,== As a leader ==,2076912
"In 2005, the Bill Stewart Trio, with Kevin Hays and Larry Goldings, released Keynote Speakers.",0,14,== As a leader ==,2076912
"The ensemble is a twist on the usual organ-guitar-drum trio, where a second keyboard (variously piano, Fender Rhodes, and other keyboard instruments) is added to the organ-drum foundation.",1,14,== As a leader ==,2076912
In December 2006 he recorded Incandescence with the same trio.,2,14,== As a leader ==,2076912
Stewart's recordings all have a certain blend of playfulness and mystery propelled by his drumming and melodic and rhythmic compositional style.,0,15,== As a leader ==,2076912
Stewart has said that he thinks it very important to find an interesting combination of musicians whose abilities will complement each other and who will sound at home on the compositions slated for the given session.,1,15,== As a leader ==,2076912

Stewart plays various Zildjian K cymbals and is endorsed by the Avedis Zildjian Company.,0,17,== Gear ==,2076912
"A collaboration with Paul Francis from Zildjian yielded the 22"" K Custom Special Dry Complex Rides (in Thin and Medium Thin weights), which are meant to replicate the sound of an old K. Zildjian cymbal Stewart has had for a long time.",1,17,== Gear ==,2076912
They were introduced in 2004.,2,17,== Gear ==,2076912
"According to Stewart, ""The K Custom Special Dry Complex Ride has some trashy quality, but can also be articulate.",3,17,== Gear ==,2076912
The nice crash sound gets out of the way quickly while a clean stick sound or click is evident when riding.,4,17,== Gear ==,2076912
"These cymbals are very pretty, yet can be very nasty.",5,17,== Gear ==,2076912
"""The cymbals were redesigned and sold as the K Custom Dry Complex II Rides since 2008 in sizes of 20, 22 and 24-inch.",6,17,== Gear ==,2076912
These custom ride cymbals feature a wider bell with a much lower profile to promote more control while offering a smooth array of rich overtones.,7,17,== Gear ==,2076912
"Weight specifications are slightly heavier (medium-thin) than the first generation of Complex Rides, to make the cymbals more versatile, providing ride patterns that can be heard clearly from within an airy wash of overtones.",8,17,== Gear ==,2076912
Zildjian has also designed the Bill Stewart Artist Series Drumsticks.,9,17,== Gear ==,2076912
