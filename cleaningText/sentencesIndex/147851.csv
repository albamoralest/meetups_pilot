"Despite persistently voting Democratic, MacKaye does not explicitly consider himself a Democrat.",0,106,== Personal life ==,147851
He has explained that he votes solely for the politician he believes is least likely to engage in war.,1,106,== Personal life ==,147851
He also noted that he had voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election.,2,106,== Personal life ==,147851
"When further probed for a summation of his political views, he explained: My rule of thumb in terms of voting for presidential elections always boils down to one thing.",3,106,== Personal life ==,147851
"Whoever becomes the president of this country is what the people of this country deserve, because it was either they voted for that person or they allowed that election to be rigged, or they didn't put enough of a fight about it.",4,106,== Personal life ==,147851
"However, the rest of the world does not deserve whoever our president is.",5,106,== Personal life ==,147851
It shouldn't be their problem at all.,6,106,== Personal life ==,147851
It's our problem.,7,106,== Personal life ==,147851
Our country has an enormous impression on the rest of the world.,8,106,== Personal life ==,147851
"In my opinion at least, the most visceral effect on the rest of the world is war, essentially murder.",9,106,== Personal life ==,147851
"This country has excelled in murdering people in other places, certainly in the last 10 years.",10,106,== Personal life ==,147851
So my rule of thumb in terms for voting is voting for the person who is electable and is least likely to engage in war.,11,106,== Personal life ==,147851
And that is it.,12,106,== Personal life ==,147851
It's a very simple equation.,13,106,== Personal life ==,147851
