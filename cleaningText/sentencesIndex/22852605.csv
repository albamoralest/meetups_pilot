One example of this is Pangu's Song (1998) written for alto flute/flute and percussion.,3,5,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
Pangu is the giant in Chinese mythology who separated heaven and earth with a great swing of his axe.,4,5,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"He held them separate for eighteen thousand years, then was laid to rest, his breath becoming the wind, his eyes the moon and the sun, his body the mountains, his veins the rivers, his sweat the rain, and the creatures carried by the wind over his body became human beings.",5,5,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"The piece is not a narrative of the myth, but evokes an earthy sound with use of the alto flute and frequent fluttertongue, which has a breathy timbre closer to a bamboo flute.",6,5,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605

"Stanford was hosting a reception for Ligeti's visit to campus, which Dong attended.",1,6,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"She remembers Ligeti walking up to her and asking directly and immediately, ""How many students died during the student movement in China?""",2,6,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Dong answered, ""Isn't one enough?"", and walked away from him.",3,6,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Ligeti must have been moved or at least interested in her reply, because later in the day he found her and said that they should have lunch together.",4,6,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Although Dong admits that it is difficult to pin-point the direct influence of Ligeti on her musical compositions, she says that Ligeti affected her life in a more philosophical way on a deeper level.",5,6,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605

Dong does admit one conversation with Ligeti that did directly affect her identity as a composer.,0,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"When Ligeti asked her what kind of composer she wanted to be known as, she replied ""a Chinese composer"".",1,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
He then asked her why she wanted to be a Chinese composer.,2,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
Dong could not provide a clear reason or justify herself.,3,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"After that conversation, Dong began questioning her identity as a composer and why she felt the need to make her music recognizably Chinese.",4,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
This marked the beginning of Dong's compositions that began testing the boundaries of what was Chinese and what was Western in her music.,5,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"In these pieces, she creates a clash between sounds of each culture rather than limit herself to writing ""Chinese"" music within a Western art music context.",6,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
Dong's computer piece Crossing is representative of this period.,7,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"In this piece, the jarring juxtaposition between rock 'n roll slap bass guitar and a well-known Beijing opera character is in no way subtle.",8,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"The timbres in Crossing are varied, unpredictable, and dissonantly opposed with one another, very different from her earlier computer piece Flying Apples, which is largely a single timbre.",9,7,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"In 1999 Dong began to improvise with Christian Wolff and Larry Polansky, and they formed an ensemble called Trio.",0,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"This would add another element to her compositions that we see in her work Earth, Water, Wood, Metal, Fire (2001), which were based on Dong's piano improvisations.",1,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"In these pieces, Dong takes inspiration from the five elements that make up the material world according to traditional Chinese beliefs, but is not seeking to write a programmatic piece.",2,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"For example, Dong says that the piece Earth does not refer literally to soil, but rather is a spiritual representation of mankind that inhabits the earth.",3,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
The movements Wood and Metal refer to pencils and metal rods placed in the piano strings that create distinct timbres.,4,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Fire, the last movement, is the longest and most energetic not because of the element fire's importance in mythology, but because compositionally its length allowed previous themes to return and bring the work to a close.",5,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"The prepared piano shows influences of John Cage, the clusters of dissonant chords are suggestive of Henry Cowell, and repeated, stagnantly moving sections could be described stylistically as minimalist music.",6,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"However, there are also fragmentary moments of pentatonic melodies as well as heterophonic passages which create the flavor of Chinese music, but in a more subtle manner than previous works.",7,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"In these pieces, after being in the US for ten years, Dong finally seems to be able to amalgamate the influences that she has been exposed to and bring them together in a balanced way.",8,8,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Another piece that Dong considers part of this ""Fusion"" period is Shui Diao Ge To & Song.",0,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"The texts for this work were the 11th century poem Shui Diao Ge by Su Shi and a contemporary poem, Song, by a friend of the composer named Denise Newman.",1,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Dong felt that these two texts balanced each other within the composition, and that her work would not be complete without one or the other.",2,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Written for mixed chorus and percussion, the piece was commissioned by the Dale Warland Singers but was deemed too difficult to perform by their conductor and was eventually premiered by Volti (then known as the San Francisco Chamber Singers) in 2003.",3,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Dong views this piece as a ""cultural amalgam of all her life's experiences"".",4,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"In 2004, Dong wrote the piece Ludamus Denuo, which she still considers part of her ""Fusion"" period, but is moving in a new direction.",5,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"The text of the piece is a 20th-century English poem written for children, which Dong has translated into medieval Latin and set for children's choir.",6,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"Here, Dong is attempting to create a sense of timelessness and stylistic anonymity in the piece.",7,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
At certain sections the piece is motet-like and at other instances evokes more of a twentieth-century harmony.,8,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605
"When it was suggested to Dong that the piece did not sound stylistically ""Chinese"", she replied by saying that she is Chinese herself and asked how anything written by herself could possibly not be Chinese.",9,9,== Compositional periods while in the US (1991–present) ==,22852605

"The first movement, ""Spring"", is based on a symmetrical chord structure based on the third (C, E) and gradually moving outward in thirds to expand the chord (A, C, E, G, then F, A, C, E, G, B).",4,13,== Analysis of The Seasons ==,22852605
