"It was here that Ricketts composed his most famous march, ""Colonel Bogey"".",1,14,== First World War ==,1095798
"While there are several speculations of how the march was begun, the most accepted is probably from a note written by Ricketts' widow to the publishers in 1958.",2,14,== First World War ==,1095798
"""While playing golf on the Fort George course, one of the members whistled the first two notes (B flat and G) instead of calling 'Fore!', and with impish spontaneity was answered by my husband with the next few notes.",0,15,== First World War ==,1095798
There was little sauntering—Moray Firth's stiff breezes encouraged a good crisp stride.,1,15,== First World War ==,1095798

"During the war Ricketts wrote several marches dedicated to the fighting forces: ""The Great Little Army"" (1916), ""On The Quarter Deck"", ""The Middy"", and ""The Voice of the Guns"" (1917), and ""The Vanished Army"" (1919) which was subtitled ""They Never Die"".",2,16,== First World War ==,1095798
By the end of the war the Band Boys had matured into a group considered by many to be the finest regimental band in the British Army.,3,16,== First World War ==,1095798

"In 1925 the Band undertook a six-month tour to New Zealand, where it was the resident band for the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition.",2,17,== First World War ==,1095798
"It was there that Ricketts wrote ""Dunedin"" (published 1928), and returning to the United Kingdom aboard the New Zealand Shipping Company's S.S. Remuera via the Panama Canal, Ricketts was moved to compose the march ""Old Panama"" (published 1929).",3,17,== First World War ==,1095798

"Since Ricketts had sufficient years of service that he could have retired, he was also free to accept any musical appointments, either civilian or military, that were offered.",1,19,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Both Colonel Stretton and senior army officials, impressed by Ricketts' service record and compositions, felt that he was the best candidate to succeed Stretton, and he was invited to apply for the position.",2,19,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"For reasons best known to himself, Ricketts declined.",3,19,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"A possibly contributing factor has emerged: it would seem that Ricketts had held a desire for some time to conduct a band in the Royal Marines, though he held this in confidence.",0,20,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Consequently, in the same year, 1921, when the Royal Marines announced a vacancy for bandmastership of the Band of the Plymouth Division, Ricketts applied, turning down the Kneller Hall application.",1,20,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"He was interviewed, and later informed that he was the successful candidateut there but there was a complication: the sitting bandmaster of the RM Plymouth Division Band, P.S.G. O'Donnell, had applied to become the director of the Grenadier Guards' Band, vacant because of retirement.",2,20,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"O'Donnell had the support of the Prince of Wales, for whom he had acted as band director on two royal tours.",3,20,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Assuming O'Donnell's appointment to the Grenadiers was a mere formality, the Marines had advertised the presumed upcoming vacancy for the Plymouth Division Band, for which Ricketts was approved.",4,20,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Then an objection was raised by a senior army bandmaster, quoting a piece of military legislation which stated that a member of the Senior Service (Royal Navy and Royal Marines) could not be commissioned into the Army.",0,21,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"The objection was upheld, O'Donnell was blocked from the Grenadier Guards, and Ricketts' appointment was cancelled.",1,21,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"The Kneller Hall vacancy had been filled by Captain Hector Adkins, so Ricketts remained with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders for another six years.",2,21,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"To make the conductors of the Royal Marines Bands more satisfied in their positions, in June 1921 King George V decreed that all Royal Marine conductors would be commissioned as directors of music.",3,21,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
This was a further incentive for Ricketts to bide his time.,4,21,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
But this 1921 incident reveals much about the character of Ricketts.,0,22,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"If he had accepted the army's invitation to apply for Kneller Hall, he would have been assured of an immediate commission in the rank of lieutenant, and eventual promotions upward to lieutenant colonel.",1,22,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Such was his dedication to staying with a band that he was willing to forgo the position and prestige that would have come with the appointment to Kneller Hall, instead preferring to accept a position with the Royal Marines as a bandmaster in the rank of Warrant Officer Class 1, exactly the same rank he had held through his 19 years with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.",2,22,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
It would appear that for Ricketts service with a band meant more than promotion or position.,3,22,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"In 1927 a Royal Marine vacancy occurred, and Ricketts again applied, was approved, and commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Marines Band Service on 4 July 1927.",0,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"He was posted to the Royal Marine Depot, Deal.",1,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"When the headquarters of the Band Service was transferred to Deal in 1930, Ricketts was posted to the Band of the Plymouth Division, Royal Marines, the principal band of the Royal Marines.",2,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Under Ricketts' direction, this band became world-famous, traveling to Paris and Canada.",3,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"Before and during World War II they made a series of 78 RPM recordings of Alford marches, which EMI reissued on an LP in 1970, and now available on CD.",4,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"It was titled ""The British March King - Alford conducts Alford"".",5,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"From 1935 to 1939 Ricketts conducted the Plymouth Band on a one-hour biweekly BBC Radio programme, and the band was in constant demand to visit military camps and war production factories throughout the Second World War.",6,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
"The workload at that time put a temporary hiatus to his composing, but he resumed in 1941 with ""By Land and Sea"" and ""Army of the Nile"", and in 1942 with ""Eagle Squadron"" dedicated to the Americans who were flying with the Royal Air Force.",7,23,== From Army to Navy ==,1095798
