Dave's current bass for Spock's Beard is a custom built hybrid between a Fender and a Rickenbacker.,0,25,== Equipment ==,4119667
"It is an Alder Ric-shaped body that is contoured like a Fender, with bolt-on Fender Jazz style neck.",1,25,== Equipment ==,4119667
Dave used four Seymour Duncan Apollo Jazz Bass pickups to do this - two in the Rickenbacker locations and two in the positions where the P / J pickus on a Fender Jazz Bass would normally go.,2,25,== Equipment ==,4119667
Further customizations include a Full Contact Hardware bridge and a Hipshot Xtender tuning key that will detune the E string down to a D at the flip of a lever.,3,25,== Equipment ==,4119667
From 1992 through 2002 Dave used a stock white Rickenbacker in Spock's Beard.,0,26,== Equipment ==,4119667
"From 2002 through the recording of ""X"" (bass tracks recorded in November 2012)  Dave's main bass was what he terms his ""Fendenbacker"".",0,27,== Equipment ==,4119667
It's a Rickenbacker 4001 bass that's been severely modified to serve a variety of purposes.,1,27,== Equipment ==,4119667
"""A buddy of mine found a really trashed Ric in a pawn shop, and I turned it into a project bass to try to make a 'one bass fits all' for myself"" says Meros.",2,27,== Equipment ==,4119667
"It has a set of Fender Jazz Bass pickups set in mid-'70s-era spacing (the bridge pickup moved closer to the bridge than in previous incarnations, giving the bass a ""tighter"" and more midrange tone) as well as the standard set of Rickenbacker pickups in the traditional Ric positions.",0,28,== Equipment ==,4119667
"This gives Meros four pickups total to choose from, with a switch that chooses between the two fairly different ""basses"", Rickenbacker or Jazz.",1,28,== Equipment ==,4119667
All four can also be activated at the same time.,2,28,== Equipment ==,4119667
"A BadAss bridge, Hipshot Bass Xtender (otherwise known as a ""Hipshot D-Tuner"" or simply a ""Hipshot"" or ""D-Tuner"" among bassists) for its ability to downtune the low E-string of a bass typically to D at the flip of a lever) and a string mute that Meros can raise or lower with thumb screws (which were fabricated by Meros himself) were also added.",3,28,== Equipment ==,4119667
"""I did the refinish on the front of the bass, made the pickguard and did a lot of the other little stuff myself, but I had John Carruthers (Venice, CA) do the stuff that really mattered, like route the body for the two extra pickups, cause you only get one chance to do that, and it has to be perfect.",0,29,== Equipment ==,4119667
"He's the man, totally.",1,29,== Equipment ==,4119667
"He also did a really versatile wiring thing for me and one of the most amazing fret jobs I've ever seen.""",2,29,== Equipment ==,4119667
"More recently, after the neck began delaminating from the body, it was completely rebuilt and refinished by Ed Roman Guitars, a company based in Las Vegas, NV.",0,30,== Equipment ==,4119667
"In 2007 Ed Roman built Dave a custom instrument designed with most of the same features and specs as the ""Fendenbacker"" (see below), with a Rickenbacker-like body shape but with a Fender scale length and neck width and more of a Fender body contouring.",0,31,== Equipment ==,4119667
"Other basses Meros uses are various Fender Jazz and Precision models (One of his Fender Precision basses was used on 2005's ""Gluttons For Punishment"" tour"" while the Rickenbacker was being repaired), a Carruthers five string, and other fretted and fretless basses.",0,32,== Equipment ==,4119667
