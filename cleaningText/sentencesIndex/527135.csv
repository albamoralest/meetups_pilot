"While Glück's work is thematically diverse, scholars and critics have identified several themes that are paramount.",0,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Most prominently, Glück's poetry can be said to focus on trauma, as she has written throughout her career about death, loss, suffering, failed relationships, and attempts at healing and renewal.",1,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"The scholar Daniel Morris notes that even a Glück poem that uses traditionally happy or idyllic imagery ""suggests the author's awareness of mortality, of the loss of innocence"".",2,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"The scholar Joanne Feit Diehl echoes this notion when she argues that ""this 'sense of an ending'… infuses Glück's poems with their retrospective power"", pointing to her transformation of common objects, such as a baby stroller, into representations of loneliness and loss.",3,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Yet, for Glück, trauma is arguably a gateway to a greater appreciation of life, a concept explored in The Triumph of Achilles.",4,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
The triumph to which the title alludes is Achilles' acceptance of mortality—which enables him to become a more fully realized human being.,5,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
Another of Glück's common themes is desire.,6,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Glück has written directly about many forms of desire—for example, the desire for love or insight—but her approach is marked by ambivalence.",7,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Morris argues that Glück's poems, which often adopt contradictory points of view, reflect ""her own ambivalent relationship to status, power, morality, gender, and, most of all, language"".",8,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"The author Robert Boyer has characterized Glück's ambivalence as a result of ""strenuous self-interrogation"".",9,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"He argues that ""Glück's poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection … for a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion"".",10,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
The tension between competing desires in Glück's work manifests both in her assumption of different personas from poem to poem and in her varied approach to each collection of her poems.,11,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"This has led the poet and scholar James Longenbach to declare that ""change is Louise Glück's highest value"" and ""if change is what she most craves, it is also what she most resists, what is most difficult for her, most hard-won"".",12,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Another of Glück's preoccupations is nature, the setting for many of her poems.",13,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"In The Wild Iris, the poems take place in a garden where flowers have intelligent, emotive voices.",14,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"However, Morris points out that The House on Marshland is also concerned with nature and can be read as a revision of the Romantic tradition of nature poetry.",15,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"In Ararat, too, ""flowers become a language of mourning"", useful for both commemoration and competition among mourners to determine the ""ownership of nature as a meaningful system of symbolism"".",16,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Thus, in Glück's work nature is both something to be regarded critically and embraced.",17,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"As the author and critic Alan Williamson has pointed out, it can also sometimes suggest the divine, as when, in the poem ""Celestial Music"", the speaker states that ""when you love the world you hear celestial music"", or when, in The Wild Iris, the deity speaks through changes in weather.",18,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
Glück's poetry is also notable for what it avoids.,19,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"Morris argues that ""Glück's writing most often evades ethnic identification, religious classification, or gendered affiliation.",20,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"In fact, her poetry often negates critical assessments that affirm identity politics as criteria for literary evaluation.",21,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
"She resists canonization as a hyphenated poet (that is, as a ""Jewish-American"" poet, or a ""feminist"" poet, or a ""nature"" poet), preferring instead to retain an aura of iconoclasm, or in-betweenness"".",22,17,== Work == | === Themes ===,527135
