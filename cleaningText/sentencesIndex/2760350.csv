"In late November 1932 Hecht became involved in a series of Mae West projects, which all eventually culminated into a single picture.",12,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
"Earlier that year Paramount had signed Mae West to a contract and the actress was eager to step up from the lower-billed role she received in her first picture, Night After Night.",13,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
"She was billed fourth, after George Raft, Constance Cummings and Wynne Gibson.",14,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
"West was working to adapt her notoriously banned play, Diamond Lil, into a film, initially titled Honky Tonk.",15,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
"But the censors objected and Paramount worked quickly to change a few scenes, re-title the film to Diamond Lil and tried again to get it into production.",16,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
"The censors objected again, Paramount went back to work and, hoping to fool the censors into thinking they were submitting an all-new film, re-titled the project Ruby Red.",17,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
But the censors found far too many similarities between Ruby Red and Diamond Lil and blocked the production completely.,18,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
"West and Paramount decided to merge Ruby Red into another West film in the writing stages, She Done Him Wrong, using the cast and crew already hired for Ruby Red.",19,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
This final version of the script made it into production.,20,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350

"Hecht was interviewed by Motion Picture Magazine in 1933, in response to Mae West's media comments regarding ""curvy women being the new trend"", to which he answered in her favor; ""Dangerous curves are not only ahead, but actually with us.",25,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
Present-day chorus girls must be slightly more round and more curved than those of a few years ago.,26,10,== First Hollywood career == | === Contract choreographer at Paramount ===,2760350
