"Jansch's musical influences included Big Bill Broonzy and Brownie McGhee, whom he first saw playing at The Howff in 1960 and, much later, claimed that he'd ""still be a gardener"" if he hadn't encountered McGhee and his music.",0,20,== Music ==,803609
"Jansch was also strongly influenced by the British folk music tradition, particularly by Anne Briggs and, to a lesser extent, A.L. Lloyd.",1,20,== Music ==,803609
"Other influences included jazz (notably Charles Mingus), early music (John Renbourn and Julian Bream) and other contemporary singer-songwriters – especially Clive Palmer.",2,20,== Music ==,803609
"The other major influence was Davy Graham who, himself, brought together an eclectic mixture of musical styles.",3,20,== Music ==,803609
"Also, in his formative years, Jansch had busked his way through Europe to Morocco, picking up musical ideas and rhythms from many sources.",4,20,== Music ==,803609
"From these influences, he distilled his own individual guitar style.",5,20,== Music ==,803609
"Some of his songs feature a basic Travis picking style of right-hand playing, but these are often distinguished by unusual chord voicings or by chords with added notes.",6,20,== Music ==,803609
"An example of this is his song ""Needle of Death"", which features a simple picking style, though several of the chords are decorated with added ninths.",7,20,== Music ==,803609
"Characteristically, the ninths are not the highest note of the chord, but appear in the middle of the arpeggiated finger-picking, creating a ""lumpiness"" to the sound.",8,20,== Music ==,803609
Another characteristic feature was his ability to hold a chord in the lower strings while bending an upper string—often bending up from a semitone below a chord note.,9,20,== Music ==,803609
"These can be heard clearly on songs such as ""Reynardine"" where the bends are from the diminished fifth to the perfect fifth.",10,20,== Music ==,803609
"Jansch often fitted the accompaniment to the natural rhythm of the words of his songs, rather than playing a consistent rhythm throughout.",11,20,== Music ==,803609
This can lead to occasional bars appearing in unusual time signatures.,12,20,== Music ==,803609
"For example, his version of the Ewan MacColl song ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", unlike most other covers of that song, switches from 4/4 time to 3/4 and 5/4.",13,20,== Music ==,803609
"A similar disregard for conventional time signatures is found in several of his collaborative compositions with Pentangle: for instance, ""Light Flight"" from the Basket of Light album includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4 time.",14,20,== Music ==,803609

"Through the development of Pentangle, Jansch played a number of instruments: banjo, Appalachian dulcimer, recorder and concertina—on rare occasions he has even been known to play electric guitar.",0,22,== Instruments ==,803609
"However, it is his acoustic guitar playing that was most notable.",1,22,== Instruments ==,803609
Jansch's first guitar was home-made from a kit,2,22,== Instruments ==,803609
"but when he left school and started work, he bought a Höfner cello-style guitar.",3,22,== Instruments ==,803609
"Soon he traded this in for a Zenith which was marketed as the ""Lonnie Donegan guitar"" and which Jansch played in the folk clubs in the early 1960s.",4,22,== Instruments ==,803609
His first album was reputedly recorded using a Martin 00028 borrowed from Martin Carthy.,5,22,== Instruments ==,803609

"He had a guitar hand-built by John Bailey, which was used for most of the Pentangle recordings but was eventually stolen.",7,22,== Instruments ==,803609
"Jansch later played two six-string guitars built by the Coventry-based luthier Rob Armstrong, one of which appears on the front and back covers of the 1980 Shanachie release, Best of Bert Jansch.",8,22,== Instruments ==,803609
"He then had a contract with Yamaha, who provided him with an FG1500 which he played, along with a Yamaha LL11 1970s jumbo guitar.",9,22,== Instruments ==,803609
"Jansch's relationship with Yamaha continued and they presented him with an acoustic guitar with gold trim and abalone inlay for his 60th birthday—although Jansch was quoted as saying that, valued at about £3000, it was too good for stage use.",10,22,== Instruments ==,803609

"The same debut album included Jansch's version of the Davy Graham instrumental ""Angie"".",5,24,== Influence ==,803609
"This was a favourite of Mike Oldfield, who practised acoustic guitar alone as a child, and was then heavily influenced by Jansch's style.",6,24,== Influence ==,803609
The title of the instrumental inspired Oldfield to call his first band (with sister Sally) the Sallyangie.,7,24,== Influence ==,803609

"Other tributes included Gordon Giltrap's album Janschology (2000) which has two tunes by Jansch, plus two others that show his influence.",12,24,== Influence ==,803609
