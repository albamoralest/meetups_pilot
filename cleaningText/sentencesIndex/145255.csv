It was initially banned by the Soviet-run Composer's Union and was not performed publicly for a quarter of a century.,3,16,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
Ligeti's earliest works are often an extension of the musical language of Béla Bartók.,4,16,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"Even his piano cycle Musica ricercata (1953), though written according to Ligeti with a ""Cartesian"" approach, in which he ""regarded all the music I knew and loved as being... irrelevant"", the piece has been described by one biographer as from a world very close to Bartók's set of piano works, Mikrokosmos.",5,16,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
Ligeti's set comprises eleven pieces in all.,6,16,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"The work is based on a simple restriction: the first piece uses exclusively one pitch A, heard in multiple octaves, and only at the very end of the piece is a second note, D, heard.",7,16,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"The second piece uses three notes (E♯, F♯, and G), the third piece uses four, and so on, so that in the final piece all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are present.",8,16,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"Shortly after its composition, Ligeti arranged six of the movements of Musica ricercata for wind quintet under the title 'Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet'.",0,17,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"The Bagatelles were performed first in 1956, but not in their entirety: the last movement was censored by the Soviets for being too 'dangerous'.",1,17,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"Because of Soviet censorship, his most daring works from this period, including Musica ricercata and his String Quartet No. 1 Métamorphoses nocturnes (1953–1954), were written for the 'bottom drawer'.",2,17,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255
"Composed of a single movement divided into seventeen contrasting sections linked motivically, the First String Quartet is Ligeti's first work to suggest a personal style of composition.",3,17,== Music == | === Compositions in Hungary ===,145255

"Upon arriving in Cologne, Ligeti began to write electronic music alongside Karlheinz Stockhausen and Gottfried Michael Koenig at the electronic studio of West German Radio (WDR).",0,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"He completed only two works in this medium, however—the pieces Glissandi (1957) and Artikulation (1958)—before returning to instrumental music.",1,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"A third work, originally entitled Atmosphères but later known as Pièce électronique Nr. 3, was planned, but the technical limitations of the time prevented Ligeti from realizing it completely.",2,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
It was finally realised in 1996 by the Dutch composers Kees Tazelaar and Johan van Kreij of the Institute of Sonology.,3,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Ligeti's music appears to have been subsequently influenced by his electronic experiments, and many of the sounds he created resembled electronic textures.",4,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Ligeti coined the term ""micropolyphony"" to describe the texture of the second movement of Apparitions (1958–59) and Atmosphères (1961).",5,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"This texture is a similar to that of polyphony, except that the polyphony is obscured in a dense and rich stack of pitches.",6,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
Micropolyphony can be used to create the nearly static but slowly evolving works such as Atmosphères in which the individual instruments become hidden in a complex web of sound.,7,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"According to Ligeti, after Apparitions and Atmosphères, he ""became famous"".",8,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"With Volumina (1961–62, revised 1966) for solo organ, Ligeti continued with clusters of notes, translated into blocks of sound.",9,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In this piece, Ligeti abandoned conventional music notation, instead using diagrams to represent general pitch areas, duration, and flurries of notes.",10,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
Poème symphonique (1962) is a work for one hundred mechanical metronomes during his brief acquaintance with Fluxus movement.,11,19,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Aventures (1962), like its companion piece Nouvelles Aventures (1962–65), is a composition for three singers and instrumental septet, to a text (of Ligeti's own devising) that is without semantic meaning.",0,20,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In these pieces, each singer has five roles to play, exploring five areas of emotion, and they switch from one to the other so quickly and abruptly that all five areas are present throughout the piece.",1,20,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Requiem (1963–65) is a work for soprano and mezzo-soprano soloists, twenty-part chorus (four each of soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), and orchestra.",2,20,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Though, at about half an hour, it is the longest piece he had composed up to that point, Ligeti sets only about half of the Requiem's traditional text: the ""Introitus"", the ""Kyrie"" (a completely chromatic quasi-fugue, where the parts are a montage of melismatic, skipping micropolyphony), and the ""Dies irae""—dividing the latter sequence into two parts, ""De die judicii"" and ""Lacrimosa"".",3,20,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
Lux Aeterna (1966) is a 16-voice a cappella piece whose text is also associated with the Latin Requiem.,0,21,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Ligeti's Cello Concerto (1966), which is dedicated to Siegfried Palm, is composed of two movements: the first begins with an almost imperceptible cello which slowly shifts into static tone clusters with the orchestra before reaching a crescendo and slowly decaying, while the second is a virtuoso piece of dynamic atonal melody on the part of the cello.",0,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Lontano (1967), for full orchestra, is another example of micropolyphony, but the overall effect is closer to harmony, with complex woven textures and opacity of the sound giving rise to a harmonious effect.",1,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
It has become a standard repertoire piece.,2,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
String Quartet No. 2 (1968) consists of five movements.,3,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
They differ widely from each other in their types of motion.,4,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In the first, the structure is largely broken up, as in Aventures.",5,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In the second, everything is reduced to very slow motion, and the music seems to be coming from a distance, with great lyricism.",6,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"The pizzicato third movement is a machine-like studies, hard and mechanical, whereby the parts playing repeated notes create a ""granulated"" continuum.",7,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In the fourth, which is fast and threatening, everything that happened before is crammed together.",8,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Lastly, in strong contrast, the fifth movement spreads itself out.",9,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In each movement, the same basic configurations return, but each time their colouring or viewpoint is different, so that the overall form only really emerges when one listens to all five movements in context.",10,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Ramifications (1968–69), completed a year before the Chamber Concerto, is scored for an ensemble of strings in twelve parts—seven violins, two violas, two cellos and a double bass—each of which may be taken by one player or several.",11,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"The twelve are divided into two numerically equal groups but with the instruments in the first group tuned approximately a quarter-tone higher (four violins, a viola and a cello).",12,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"As the group play, the one tuned higher inevitably tends to slide down toward the other, and both get nearer each other in pitch.",13,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In the Chamber Concerto (1969–70), several layers, processes and kinds of movement can take place on different planes simultaneously.",14,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In spite of frequent markings of ""senza tempo"", the instrumentalists are not given linear freedom; Ligeti insists on keeping his texture under strict control at any given moment.",15,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"The form is like a ""precision mechanism"".",16,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
Ligeti was always fascinated by machines that do not work properly and by the world of technology and automation.,17,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"The use of periodic mechanical noises, suggesting not-quite-reliable machinery, occurs in many of his works.",18,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"The scoring is for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe (doubling oboe d'amore and cor anglais), clarinet, bass clarinet (doubling second clarinet), horn, trombone, harpsichord (doubling Hammond organ), piano (doubling celesta), and solo string quintet.",19,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Most of these compositions establish timbre, rather than the traditionally-favored dimensions of pitch and rhythm, as their principal formal parameter, a practice that has come to be known as sonorism.",20,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"From the 1970s, Ligeti turned away from sonorism and began to concentrate on rhythm.",21,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
Pieces such as Continuum (1968) and Clocks and Clouds (1972–73) were written before he heard the music of Steve Reich and Terry Riley in 1972.,22,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"But the second of his Three Pieces for Two Pianos (1976), entitled ""Self-portrait with Reich and Riley (and Chopin in the background)"", commemorates this affirmation and influence.",23,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"During the 1970s, he also became interested in the polyphonic pipe music of the Banda-Linda tribe from the Central African Republic, which he heard through the recordings of one of his students.",24,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"In 1977, Ligeti completed his only opera, Le Grand Macabre, thirteen years after its initial commission.",25,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Loosely based on Michel de Ghelderode's 1934 play, La balade du grand macabre, it is a work of Absurd theatre—Ligeti called it an ""anti-anti-opera""—in which Death (Nekrotzar) arrives in the fictional city of Breughelland and announces that the end of the world will occur at midnight.",26,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Musically, Le Grand Macabre draws on techniques not associated with Ligeti's previous work, including quotations and pseudo-quotations of other works and the use of consonant thirds and sixths.",27,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"After Le Grand Macabre, Ligeti would abandon the use of pastiche, but would increasingly incorporate consonant harmonies (even major and minor triads) into his work, albeit not in a diatonic context.",28,22,== Music == | === From 1956 to Le Grand Macabre ===,145255

"Besides two short pieces for harpsichord, he did not complete another major work until the Trio for Violin, Horn and Piano in 1982, over four years after the opera.",1,24,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"His music of the 1980s and 1990s continued to emphasise complex mechanical rhythms, often in a less densely chromatic idiom, tending to favour displaced major and minor triads and polymodal structures.",2,24,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"During this time, Ligeti also began to explore alternate tuning systems through the use of natural harmonics for horns (as in the Horn Trio and Piano Concerto) and scordatura for strings (as in the Violin Concerto).",3,24,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Additionally, most of his works in this period are multi-movement works, rather than the extended single movements of Atmosphères and San Francisco Polyphony.",4,24,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"From 1985 to 2001, Ligeti completed three books of Études for piano (Book I, 1985; Book II, 1988–94; Book III, 1995–2001).",0,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255

"Book I was written as preparation for the Piano Concerto, which contains a number of similar motivic and melodic elements.",2,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
Ligeti's music from the last two decades of his life is unmistakable for its rhythmic complexity.,3,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Writing about his first book of Piano Études, the composer claims this rhythmic complexity stems from two vastly different sources of inspiration: the Romantic-era piano music of Chopin and Schumann and the indigenous music of sub-Saharan Africa.",4,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
The difference between the earlier and later pieces lies in a new conception of pulse.,5,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255

"The effect of these different subdivisions, especially when they occur simultaneously, is to blur the aural landscape, creating the micropolyphonic effect of Ligeti's music.",7,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"On the other hand, the later music—and a few earlier pieces such as Continuum—treats the pulse as a musical atom, a common denominator, a basic unit, which cannot be divided further.",8,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"Different rhythms appear through multiplications of the basic pulse, rather than divisions: this is the principle of African music seized on by Ligeti.",9,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"It also appears in the music of Philip Glass, Steve Reich and others; and significantly it shares much in common with the additive rhythms of Balkan folk music, the music of Ligeti's youth.",10,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
"He described the music of Conlon Nancarrow, with its extremely complex explorations of polyrhythmic complexity, as ""the greatest discovery since Webern and Ives... something great and important for all music history!",11,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255

"""In 1988, Ligeti completed his Piano Concerto, writing that ""I present my artistic credo in the Piano Concerto: I demonstrate my independence from criteria of the traditional avantgarde, as well as the fashionable postmodernism.""",13,25,== Music == | === After Le Grand Macabre ===,145255
