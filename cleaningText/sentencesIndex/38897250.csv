"Born into a music-infused environment (""When I was two years old, I used to lie underneath our grand piano with our dog while he was practicing or composing""), Brent quickly displayed an interest in, and affinity for, his father's calling, and the wholehearted support afforded his youthful explorations – ""I was playing on cardboard boxes when I was three years old; he got me my first drum set when I was six"" – reaped early dividends for both father and son, as recalled in an interview recorded shortly after Fischer's death in January 2012:",0,4,== Career == | === Early life ===,38897250

"And that bass player, who was a very fine bassist, but was also getting busy with other projects, had to leave the group.",3,5,== Career == | === Early life ===,38897250

"While continuing to perform and record with Salsa Picante, Fischer also began to assist his father in his commercial arranging assignments, commencing in 1985 with Prince's album Parade (not coincidentally, the first time the elder Fischer had been called upon by one of his arranging clients to participate in such a large proportion of an album's contents); his task was to provide transcriptions of the basic audio tracks sent by the clients.",0,7,== Career == | === 1980s ===,38897250

"On July 13, 1989, Brent Fischer's 25th birthday celebration was abruptly preempted by news of his father's hospitalization; a roadside traffic dispute between the 60-year-old Fischer and a man half his age had escalated, resulting in a near-fatal skull fracture and concussion.",0,10,== Career == | === 1980s ===,38897250
"Not only was he incapacitated for approximately a month (and any subsequent performances and recordings delayed by more than seven months); it catapulted his son into the position of interim liaison/spokesperson/manager (not to mention coordinator of various fund-raising efforts to help defray the resulting medical expenses), assignments which, in varying degrees, would outlast the elder Fischer's recuperation, continuing indefinitely.",1,10,== Career == | === 1980s ===,38897250

"When he needed help making a deadline, I'd either orchestrate something that he'd written or we would do, for lack of a better term, tag team arranging.",0,15,== Career == | === 1990s ===,38897250
"He'd write something all day and then go to bed and I'd come over after I'd slept all day and sit at the piano and fill in the same score and continue where he left off, then I'd go to bed, and when he got up in the morning he'd pick up where I had left off.",1,15,== Career == | === 1990s ===,38897250
"That worked really well because my style was so similar to his, I didn't have to worry about finishing a phrase and neither did he...",2,15,== Career == | === 1990s ===,38897250
That was a wonderful experience.,3,15,== Career == | === 1990s ===,38897250

We went through a long time of seeing all the different medical specialists and they finally found the right combination of medications to get everything back to normal.,1,18,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"Meanwhile, we had the deadline approaching and I took it upon myself to write the arrangement...",2,18,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250

"I wanted to make sure we got a chance to record him playing, we got a chance to record all of his bands playing, and even if he only got a chance to hear rough tracks, or even, in the case of some large orchestral pieces, a computer mock-up using samples.",1,20,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
I'm happy to say I did accomplish that goal... and got specific instructions from him for how each of these pieces should be finalized.,2,20,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"Now because we've been doing all this recording, it's finally time to start releasing.",3,20,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"We did a little bit last year, but I'm also happy to say that over the next decade, I hope to be able to release a lot of new Clare Fischer material; compositions and some of his playing that nobody to this date has heard.",4,20,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250

"When I reflect back on all the music in my life, I can't help but think about the pieces I wrote that have yet to be released.",0,22,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
There is much material and several years ago I asked my son Brent to see that it all gets done.,1,22,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"He has worked tirelessly and, having absorbed my style over the decades, is uniquely qualified to direct these recordings, in some cases finishing works for me so, at my age, I can just listen and enjoy.",2,22,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"While engaged in this ambitious undertaking on his father's behalf, Fischer began to build his own arranging résumé, providing backgrounds for artists such as Toni Braxton, Eric Benet, Kirk Franklin, Usher, Al Jarreau and Michael Jackson.",0,23,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"As the decade wore on, however, his father's health continued to worsen and Fischer intensified his efforts.",1,23,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"These would culminate in the near simultaneous release, in September 2011, of two new albums, one with the vocal ensemble, and one with the big band, the latter bringing Fischer his 11th Grammy nomination.",2,23,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
"In retrospect, the hastening of Brent's efforts proved well-judged, as his father did not live to see his album's Grammy bid fall short, dying on January 26, 2012, more than two weeks prior to the awards ceremony.",3,23,== Career == | === 2000 and beyond ===,38897250
