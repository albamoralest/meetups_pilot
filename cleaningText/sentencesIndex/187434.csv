"In an era when the most popular songs were simultaneously promoted by several artists (for example, ""Over There"" was a top-10 hit for six different acts in 1917–18), Williams' repertoire was left comparatively untouched by competing singers.",3,13,== Abyssinia and recording success ==,187434

Bandanna Land continued the duo's series of hits and introduced a tour de force sketch that soon Williams made famous: his pantomime poker game.,0,19,== Bandanna Land ==,187434
"In total silence, Williams acted out a hand of poker, with only his facial expressions and body language conveying the dealer's up-and-down emotions as he considered his hand, reacted to the unseen actions of his invisible opponents, and weighed the pros and cons of raising or calling the bet.",1,19,== Bandanna Land ==,187434

"The brash Walker would have resisted such an insult to his star status, but the more reserved Williams did not protest.",4,22,== Solo career ==,187434
Allies were few; big-time vaudeville managers were fearful of attracting a disproportionate number of Black audience members and thus allowed only one Black act per bill.,5,22,== Solo career ==,187434

"A Chicago critic wrote, ""They are racial, those hands and feet,"" while a Boston reviewer felt that the show's flimsiness and lack of structure were actually attributes because ""when we succumb to the surreptitious desire for the broad tang of ""nigger"" humor, we want no disturbing atom of intelligence busy-bodying about.""",3,23,== Solo career ==,187434
"Meanwhile, many Black reviewers ignored the show's faults, praising Williams' continued persistence and prominence as much if not more than his actual performance; an Indianapolis reviewer thought the play was evidence that ""we are nearing the day of better things.""",4,23,== Solo career ==,187434
"Despite the good if loaded notices, Mr. Lode of Koal played a secondary string of theaters and was a box office flop.",5,23,== Solo career ==,187434

"The Victoria Theater responded by cutting Williams to secondary billing, but putting his name on the marquee in lettering twice as large as that of the nominal headliner.",1,24,== Solo career ==,187434

Errol's fast-taking persona and frenetic physical comedy gave Williams his first effective onstage foil since Walker's retirement.,2,29,== Ziegfeld Follies ==,187434

"He returned to the Follies of 1919, but once again was saddled with sub-par material, including a supporting part in a minstrel show segment.",5,34,== Ziegfeld Follies ==,187434
"Between 1918 and 1921, he recorded several records in the guise of ""Elder Eatmore"", an unscrupulous preacher, as well as songs dealing with Prohibition, such as ""Everybody Wants a Key to My Cellar"", ""Save a Little Dram for Me"", ""Ten Little Bottles"", and the smash hit, ""The Moon Shines on the Moonshine"".",0,35,== Ziegfeld Follies ==,187434
