He decided to migrate to Britain to highlight the conditions in which Polish composers were being forced to work.,13,15,== Biography == | === Socialist realism ===,1739123

"Having left Poland without any money or possessions, income from occasional conducting engagements made it hard for Panufnik to make ends meet.",0,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
He received financial support from fellow composers including Ralph Vaughan Williams and Arthur Benjamin; Panufnik was as heartened by the gesture of professional solidarity as by the money.,1,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
His old friend the pianist Witold Małcużyński also helped by finding for Panufnik a wealthy patron.,2,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"""Scarlett"" Panufnik published a book about Panufnik's life in Poland and his escape, but its surmises and inaccuracies distressed Panufnik; Panufnik and Scarlett drifted apart, as she craved excitement and society while he wanted only peace and quiet for composing.",3,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"In 1960, Panufnik visited the United States to visit Leopold Stokowski.",4,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"Stokowski had given the American premiere of the Symphony of Peace in 1953, and in 1957 he conducted the world premiere of Panufnik's revised version of the symphony, entitled ""Sinfonia Elegiaca"", which is dedicated to all the victims of World War II.",5,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"Stokowski gave American premieres also of Panufnik's ""Katyń Epitaph"", his ""Universal Prayer"" and ""Sinfonia Sacra"".",6,18,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
Panufnik continued to find it frustratingly difficult to get permission to travel to the States.,0,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"In the wake of McCarthyism, the staff at the American Embassy in London were unhelpful, and treated him with suspicion: Panufnik was surprised to have to supply fingerprints, and he was pointedly asked more than once whether he had ever been a member of the Polish United Workers' Party.",1,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"The irony of this difficulty, after his recent public defection to the west, was not lost on Panufnik.",2,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
Shortly after settling in Britain Panufnik was given an exclusive publishing contract with the prestigious firm of Boosey & Hawkes.,3,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"They could get no answer from the Polish State publishers as to their long-term intentions for Panufnik's existing works, all of which had appeared under their imprint.",4,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
Panufnik was therefore advised to introduce small revisions into all his existing works to avoid copyright problems when Boosey & Hawkes took these works into their catalogue.,5,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"Just after he completed this task, he heard that the Polish State Publishers had finally confirmed that they had no further interest in their catalogue of Panufnik's music.",6,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"Panufnik bemoaned the time wasted, and indeed the surviving original scores (copies of which had already been sent to some libraries in the West, including Harvard University) show that Panufnik's revisions excised some of the more radical passages in these works.",7,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"Nevertheless, all the music he wrote before 1955 continues to be performed in the revised editions.",8,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
For two years from 1957 to 1959 Panufnik's financial situation eased slightly when he was appointed Principal Conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.,9,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123

The British MP Neil Marten (who had been the person at the British Foreign Office responsible for looking after Panufnik's defection) suggested that Camilla Jessel could help him with his correspondence.,15,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
"Panufnik accepted, and she rapidly discovered that he had not replied to letters offering conducting engagements and enquiring about commissions.",16,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
Accepting these engagements and commissions gave Panufnik the resources to allow him to devote more time to composition.,17,19,== Biography == | === Life in the West ===,1739123
