Stockhausen began to compose in earnest only during his third year at the conservatory.,0,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"His early student compositions remained out of the public eye until, in 1971, he published Chöre für Doris, Drei Lieder for alto voice and chamber orchestra, Choral for a cappella choir (all three from 1950), and a Sonatine for violin and piano (1951).",1,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In August 1951, just after his first Darmstadt visit, Stockhausen began working with a form of athematic serial composition that rejected the twelve-tone technique of Schoenberg.",2,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"He characterized many of these earliest compositions (together with the music of other, like-minded composers of the period) as punktuelle Musik, ""punctual"" or ""pointist"" music, commonly mistranslated as ""pointillist"", though one critic concluded after analysing several of these early works that Stockhausen ""never really composed punctually"".",3,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"Compositions from this phase include Kreuzspiel (1951), the Klavierstücke I–IV (1952—the fourth of this first set of four Klavierstücke, titled Klavierstück IV, is specifically cited by Stockhausen as an example of ""punctual music"", and the first (unpublished) versions of Punkte and Kontra-Punkte (1952).",4,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"However, several works from these same years show Stockhausen formulating his ""first really ground-breaking contribution to the theory and, above all, practice of composition"", that of ""group composition"", found in Stockhausen's works as early as 1952 and continuing throughout his compositional career.",5,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"This principle was first publicly described by Stockhausen in a radio talk from December 1955, titled ""Gruppenkomposition: Klavierstück I"".",6,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In December 1952, he composed a Konkrete Etüde, realized in Pierre Schaeffer's Paris musique concrète studio.",7,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In March 1953, he moved to the NWDR studio in Cologne and turned to electronic music with two Electronic Studies (1953 and 1954), and then introducing spatial placements of sound sources with his mixed concrète and electronic work Gesang der Jünglinge (1955–56).",8,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
Experiences gained from the Studies made plain that it was an unacceptable oversimplification to regard timbres as stable entities.,9,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"Reinforced by his studies with Meyer-Eppler, beginning in 1955, Stockhausen formulated new ""statistical"" criteria for composition, focussing attention on the aleatoric, directional tendencies of sound movement, ""the change from one state to another, with or without returning motion, as opposed to a fixed state"".",10,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"Stockhausen later wrote, describing this period in his compositional work, ""The first revolution occurred from 1952/53 as musique concrète, electronic tape music, and space music, entailing composition with transformers, generators, modulators, magnetophones, etc; the integration of all concrete and abstract (synthetic) sound possibilities (also all noises), and the controlled projection of sound in space"".",11,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"His position as ""the leading German composer of his generation"" was established with Gesang der Jünglinge and three concurrently composed pieces in different media: Zeitmaße for five woodwinds, Gruppen for three orchestras, and Klavierstück XI.",12,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268

3 of Die Reihe.,15,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"His work with electronic music and its utter fixity led him to explore modes of instrumental and vocal music in which performers' individual capabilities and the circumstances of a particular performance (e.g., hall acoustics) may determine certain aspects of a composition.",16,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"He called this ""variable form"".",17,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In other cases, a work may be presented from a number of different perspectives.",18,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In Zyklus (1959), for example, he began using graphic notation for instrumental music.",19,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"The score is written so that the performance can start on any page, and it may be read upside down, or from right to left, as the performer chooses.",20,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
Still other works permit different routes through the constituent parts.,21,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"Stockhausen called both of these possibilities ""polyvalent form"", which may be either open form (essentially incomplete, pointing beyond its frame), as with Klavierstück XI (1956), or ""closed form"" (complete and self-contained) as with Momente (1962–64/69).",22,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In many of his works, elements are played off against one another, simultaneously and successively: in Kontra-Punkte (""Against Points"", 1952–53), which, in its revised form became his official ""opus 1"", a process leading from an initial ""point"" texture of isolated notes toward a florid, ornamental ending is opposed by a tendency from diversity (six timbres, dynamics, and durations) toward uniformity (timbre of solo piano, a nearly constant soft dynamic, and fairly even durations).",23,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In Gruppen (1955–57), fanfares and passages of varying speed (superimposed durations based on the harmonic series) are occasionally flung between three full orchestras, giving the impression of movement in space.",24,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268
"In his Kontakte for electronic sounds (optionally with piano and percussion) (1958–60), he achieved for the first time an isomorphism of the four parameters of pitch, duration, dynamics, and timbre.",25,22,== Compositions == | === 1950s ===,17268

"Two years later, he began an expansive cantata titled Momente (1962–64/69), for solo soprano, four choir groups and thirteen instrumentalists.",1,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
"In 1963, Stockhausen created Plus-Minus, ""2 × 7 pages for realisation"" containing basic note materials and a complex system of transformations to which those materials are to be subjected in order to produce an unlimited number of different compositions.",2,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
"Through the rest of the 1960s, he continued to explore such possibilities of ""process composition"" in works for live performance, such as Prozession (1967), Kurzwellen, and Spiral (both 1968), culminating in the verbally described ""intuitive music"" compositions of Aus den sieben Tagen (1968) and Für kommende Zeiten (1968–70).",3,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
"Some of his later works, such as Ylem (1972) and the first three parts of Herbstmusik (1974), also fall under this rubric.",4,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
"Several of these process compositions were featured in the all-day programmes presented at Expo 70, for which Stockhausen composed two more similar pieces, Pole for two players, and Expo for three.",5,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
"In other compositions, such as Stop for orchestra (1965), Adieu for wind quintet (1966), and the Dr. K Sextett, which was written in 1968–69 in honour of Alfred Kalmus of Universal Edition, he presented his performers with more restricted improvisational possibilities.",6,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
"He pioneered live electronics in Mixtur (1964/67/2003) for orchestra and electronics, Mikrophonie I (1964) for tam-tam, two microphones, two filters with potentiometers (6 players), Mikrophonie II (1965) for choir, Hammond organ, and four ring modulators, and Solo for a melody instrument with feedback (1966).",7,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268

"At this time, Stockhausen also began to incorporate pre-existent music from world traditions into his compositions.",11,24,== Compositions == | === 1960s ===,17268
