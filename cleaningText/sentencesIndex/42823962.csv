"A later work, Visage (1961) sees Berio creating a wordless emotional language by cutting up and rearranging a recording of Cathy Berberian's voice; therefore the composition is based on the symbolic and representative charge of gestures and voice inflections, “from inarticulate sounds to syllables, from laughter to tears and singing, from aphasia to inflection patterns from specific languages: English and Italian, Hebrew and the Neapolitan dialect.""",2,7,== Work ==,42823962

"He also wrote an ending for Giacomo Puccini's opera Turandot (premiered in Las Palmas on 24 January 2002 and in the same year in Los Angeles, Amsterdam and Salzburg) and in Rendering (1989) took the few sketches Franz Schubert made for his Symphony No. 10 and completed them by adding music derived from other Schubert works.",2,44,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Transcription is a vital part of even Berio's ""creative"" works.",0,45,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"In ""Two Interviews"", Berio mused about what a college course in transcription would look like, looking not only at Franz Liszt, Ferruccio Busoni, Igor Stravinsky, Johann Sebastian Bach, himself, and others, but to what extent composition is always self-transcription.",1,45,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"In this respect, Berio rejected and distanced himself from notions of ""collage"", preferring instead the position of ""transcriber"", arguing that ""collage"" implies a certain arbitrary abandon that runs counter to the careful control of his highly intellectual play, especially within Sinfonia but throughout his ""deconstructive"" works.",2,45,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Rather, each quotation carefully evokes the context of its original work, creating an open web, but an open web with highly specific referents and a vigorously defined, if self-proliferating, signifier-signified relationship.",3,45,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"""I'm not interested in collages, and they amuse me only when I'm doing them with my children: then they become an exercise in relativizing and 'decontextualizing' images, an elementary exercise whose healthy cynicism won't do anyone any harm"", Berio told interviewer Rossana Dalmonte.",4,45,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Perhaps Berio's most notable contribution to the world of post-WWII non-serial experimental music, running throughout most of his works, is his engagement with the broader world of critical theory (epitomized by his lifelong friendship with linguist and critical theorist Umberto Eco) through his compositions.",0,46,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Berio's works are often analytic acts: deliberately analysing myths, stories, the components of words themselves, his own compositions, or preexisting musical works.",1,46,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"In other words, it is not only the composition of the ""collage"" that conveys meaning; it is the particular composition of the component ""sound-image"" that conveys meaning, even extra-musical meaning.",2,46,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"The technique of the ""collage"", that he is associated with, is, then, less a neutral process than a conscious, Joycean process of analysis-by-composition, a form of analytic transcription of which Sinfonia and the Chemins are the most prominent examples.",3,46,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Berio often offers his compositions as forms of academic or cultural discourse themselves rather than as ""mere"" fodder for them.",4,46,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Among Berio's other compositions are  Circles (1960), Sequenza III (1966), and Recital I (for Cathy) (1972), all written for Berberian, and a number of stage works, with Un re in ascolto, a collaboration with Italo Calvino, the best known.",0,47,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"Berio's ""central instrumental focus"", if such a thing exists, is probably with the voice, the piano, the flute, and the strings.",0,48,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
"He wrote many remarkable pieces for piano which vary from solo pieces to essentially concerto pieces (points on the curve to find, concerto for two pianos, and Coro, which has a strong backbone of harmonic and melodic material entirely based on the piano part).",1,48,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
Lesser known works make use of a very distinguishable polyphony unique to Berio that develops in a variety of ways.,0,49,== Work == | === Transcriptions and arrangements ===,42823962
