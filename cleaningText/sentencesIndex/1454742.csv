"Although very much an advocate of contemporary music, Bauer herself was considered relatively conservative as a composer; her works from the 1910s-1920s mostly contain a pitch center, and she only turned to serialism briefly in the 1940s with works such as Patterns.",0,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742
"Her music is generally melodically driven, using “extended tonality [and] emphasizing colouristic harmony and diatonic dissonance.”",1,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742
"Both impressionistic and romantic influences feature in her works, but Bauer's studies with Gédalge particularly marked a change in her style from conventionally tonal to a more impressionistic, post-tonal idiom as demonstrated in her 1924 works Quietude and Turbulence.",2,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742
"For the remainder of her career, though, Bauer continued to integrate both the romanticism advocated by her German teachers with the impressionism she encountered in Paris and in the music of her close friend Charles Tomlinson Griffes.",3,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742
The influence of the latter is particularly evident in comparing Bauer's 1917 work Three Impressions for piano to Griffes's Roman Sketches published a year earlier: each is an impressionistic-style suite with a poem preceding each movement.,4,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742
The discrepancy between the relative conservatism of Bauer's work versus the more experimental works she advocated in her writings such as Twentieth Century Music is partially explained by her publisher Arthur P.

"Schmidt and Bauer, although maintaining a close relationship, notably disagreed on style.",6,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742

"It is also possible that the experience of having her Violin Sonata (later published under the title Fantasia Quasi Una Sonata) demoted from first to second place in the 1928 Society for the Publication of American Music competition expressly for its ""modernist tendencies"" led Bauer to adopt a comparatively conservative style of composition.",11,15,== Music == | === Style and influences ===,1454742
