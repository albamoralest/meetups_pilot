Pianist and composer Franz Liszt was also a conductor.,11,8,== History == | === 19th century ===,199162
"Wagner's one-time champion Hans von Bülow (1830–1894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of Franz Liszt, whose daughter Cosima he married – although she was to abandon him for Wagner.",0,9,== History == | === 19th century ===,199162

"Nikisch premiered important works by Anton Bruckner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who greatly admired his work; Johannes Brahms, after hearing him conduct his Fourth Symphony, said it was ""quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better.""",2,12,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Nikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra.",0,13,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
He also made one of the earliest recordings of a complete symphony: the Beethoven Fifth with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913.,1,13,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film – alas, silently.",2,13,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162

"Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes.",1,14,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
They were the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini (1867–1957) and the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler (1886–1954).,2,14,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Toscanini played in orchestras under Giuseppe Verdi and made his debut conducting Aida in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor.",3,14,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
He is to this day regarded by such authorities as James Levine as the greatest of all Verdi conductors.,4,14,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like Bülow or, before him, Wagner.",5,14,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.",6,14,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Furtwängler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo – but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly.",0,15,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist Heinrich Schenker, who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece, a strength of Furtwängler's conducting.",1,15,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtwängler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.",2,15,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"The two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtwängler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way).",0,16,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized.",1,16,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like Leopold Stokowski (1882–1977), Otto Klemperer (1885–1973), Herbert von Karajan (1908–1989) and Leonard Bernstein (1918–1990) – incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame – had widely varied techniques.",2,16,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Karajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s–80s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955–89) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the New York Philharmonic (1957–69), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe.",0,17,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually, he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements.",1,17,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax.",2,17,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 – performing Mahler's Symphony No. 9 – he tried to get the orchestra to produce an ""ugly"" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).",3,17,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Both Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways.",0,18,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk.",1,18,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him – he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc – but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.",2,18,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"In the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique – particularly with the right hand and the baton – became increasingly standardized.",0,19,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
"Conductors like Willem Mengelberg in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time.",1,19,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162
A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid.,2,19,== History == | === 20th century ===,199162

This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching.,1,28,== Technique == | === Beat and tempo ===,199162

"A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously.",1,38,== Technique == | === Cueing ===,199162
Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time.,2,38,== Technique == | === Cueing ===,199162
"Cueing is also helpful in the case of a pedal point with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note.",3,38,== Technique == | === Cueing ===,199162
"Cueing is achieved by ""engaging"" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players.",4,38,== Technique == | === Cueing ===,199162
"An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible ""sniff"" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors.",5,38,== Technique == | === Cueing ===,199162

"In most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite.",0,43,== Technique == | === Other musical elements ===,199162
