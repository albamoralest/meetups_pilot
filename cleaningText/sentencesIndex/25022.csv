"""Over the past twenty-five years,"" opined Michael Dirda in The New York Review of Books in 2008, ""Paul Auster has established one of the most distinctive niches in contemporary literature.""",0,26,== Reception ==,25022
Dirda also has extolled his loaded virtues in The Washington Post:,1,26,== Reception ==,25022
"Ever since City of Glass, the first volume of his New York Trilogy, Auster has perfected a limpid, confessional style, then used it to set disoriented heroes in a seemingly familiar world gradually suffused with mounting uneasiness, vague menace and possible hallucination.",0,27,== Reception ==,25022
"His plots – drawing on elements from suspense stories, existential récit, and autobiography – keep readers turning the pages, but sometimes end by leaving them uncertain about what they've just been through.",1,27,== Reception ==,25022
"Writing about Auster's most recent novel, 4 3 2 1, Booklist critic Donna Seaman remarked:Auster has been turning readers' heads for three decades, bending the conventions of storytelling, blurring the line between fiction and autobiography, infusing novels with literary and cinematic allusions, and calling attention to the art of storytelling itself, not with cool, intellectual remove, but rather with wonder, gratitude, daring, and sly humor. ...",0,28,== Reception ==,25022
Auster's fiction is rife with cosmic riddles and rich in emotional complexity.,1,28,== Reception ==,25022
"He now presents his most capacious, demanding, eventful, suspenseful, erotic, structurally audacious, funny, and soulful novel to date. ...",2,28,== Reception ==,25022
"Auster is conducting a grand experiment, not only in storytelling, but also in the endless nature-versus-nurture debate, the perpetual dance between inheritance and free will, intention and chance, dreams and fate.",3,28,== Reception ==,25022
This elaborate investigation into the big what-if is also a mesmerizing dramatization of the multitude of clashing selves we each harbor within. ...,4,28,== Reception ==,25022
"A paean to youth, desire, books, creativity, and unpredictability, it is a four-faceted bildungsroman and an ars poetica, in which Auster elucidates his devotion to literature and art.",5,28,== Reception ==,25022
"He writes, 'To combine the strange with the familiar: that was what Ferguson aspired to, to observe the world as closely as the most dedicated realist and yet to create a way of seeing the world through a different, slightly distorting lens.'",6,28,== Reception ==,25022
"Auster achieves this and much more in his virtuoso, magnanimous, and ravishing opus.",7,28,== Reception ==,25022
"The English critic James Wood, however, offered Auster little praise:",0,29,== Reception ==,25022
"Clichés, borrowed language, bourgeois bêtises are intricately bound up with modern and postmodern literature.",0,30,== Reception ==,25022
"For Flaubert, the cliché and the received idea are beasts to be toyed with and then slain.",1,30,== Reception ==,25022
"""Madame Bovary"" actually italicizes examples of foolish or sentimental phrasing.",2,30,== Reception ==,25022
"Charles Bovary's conversation is likened to a pavement, over which many people have walked; twentieth-century literature, violently conscious of mass culture, extends this idea of the self as a kind of borrowed tissue, full of other people's germs.",3,30,== Reception ==,25022
"Among modern and postmodern writers, Beckett, Nabokov, Richard Yates, Thomas Bernhard, Muriel Spark, Don DeLillo, Martin Amis, and David Foster Wallace have all employed and impaled cliché in their work.",4,30,== Reception ==,25022
"Paul Auster is probably America's best-known postmodern novelist; his ""New York Trilogy"" must have been read by thousands who do not usually read avant-garde fiction.",5,30,== Reception ==,25022
"Auster clearly shares this engagement with mediation and borrowedness—hence, his cinematic plots and rather bogus dialogue—and yet he does nothing with cliché except use it.",6,30,== Reception ==,25022
"This is bewildering, on its face, but then Auster is a peculiar kind of postmodernist.",7,30,== Reception ==,25022
Or is he a postmodernist at all?,8,30,== Reception ==,25022
"Eighty per cent of a typical Auster novel proceeds in a manner indistinguishable from American realism; the remaining twenty per cent does a kind of postmodern surgery on the eighty per cent, often casting doubt on the veracity of the plot.",9,30,== Reception ==,25022
"Nashe, in ""The Music of Chance"" (1990), sounds as if he had sprung from a Raymond Carver story (although Carver would have written more interesting prose) ...",10,30,== Reception ==,25022
"One reads Auster's novels very fast, because they are lucidly written, because the grammar of the prose is the grammar of the most familiar realism (the kind that is, in fact, comfortingly artificial), and because the plots, full of sneaky turns and surprises and violent irruptions, have what the Times once called ""all the suspense and pace of a bestselling thriller.""",11,30,== Reception ==,25022
"There are no semantic obstacles, lexical difficulties, or syntactical challenges.",12,30,== Reception ==,25022
The books fairly hum along.,13,30,== Reception ==,25022
"The reason Auster is not a realist writer, of course, is that his larger narrative games are anti-realist or surrealist.",14,30,== Reception ==,25022
