In 1776.,0,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
Hopkinson designed the Great Seal of New Jersey with assistance from Pierre Eugene du,1,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
Simitiere in 1776.,2,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
He was thus chosen as a consultant to design the Great Seal of the United States.,3,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
"Fourteen men worked on the Great Seal of the United States, including two other consultants – Simitiere (first Great Seal committee) and William Barton (third committee).",4,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
"The seal was finalized on June 20, 1782.",5,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
"In the current rendition of the Great Seal of the United States, the 13 stars (constellation) representing the 13 original states have five points.",6,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
They are arranged in the shape of a larger star with six points.,7,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
"The constellation comprising 13 smaller stars symbolizes the national motto, ""E pluribus unum.""",8,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
"Originally, the design had individual stars with six points, but this was changed in 1841 when a new die was cast.",9,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
This seal is now impressed upon the reverse of the United States one-dollar bill.,10,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
"The reverse of the seal, designed by Barton, contains an unfinished pyramid below a radiant eye.",11,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022
The unfinished pyramid was an image used by Hopkinson when he designed the Continental $50 currency bill.,12,22,== Great Seal of the United States ==,11022

"On June 14, 1777,  the Second Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as the first official national flag of the newly independent United States (later celebrated as Flag Day).",0,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
The resolution creating the flag came from the Continental Marine Committee.,1,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
Hopkinson became a member of the committee in 1776.,2,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"At the time of the flag's adoption, he was the chairman of the Navy Board, which was under the Marine Committee.",3,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Today, that office has been transferred to the United States Secretary of the Navy.",4,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Hopkinson is recognized as the designer of the Flag of the United States, and the journals of the Continental Congress support this.",5,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"On May 25, 1780, Hopkinson wrote a letter to the Continental Board of Admiralty mentioning several patriotic designs he had completed during the previous three years.",6,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"One was his Board of Admiralty seal, which contained a shield of seven red and six white stripes on a blue field.",7,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Others included the Treasury Board seal, ""7 devices for the Continental Currency,"" and ""the Flag of the United States of America.""",8,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Hopkinson noted that he had not asked for any compensation for the designs but was seeking a reward: ""a Quarter Cask of the public Wine.""",9,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
The board sent that letter on to Congress.,10,24,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Hopkinson submitted another bill on June 24 for his ""drawings and devices.""",0,25,== United States Flag ==,11022
"In this second letter, Hopkinson did not mention designing the flag of the United States.",1,25,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Instead, the first item listed was ""the great Naval Flag of the United States"" along with the other contributions.",2,25,== United States Flag ==,11022
This flag with its red outer stripes was designed to show up well on ships at sea.,3,25,== United States Flag ==,11022
"A parallel flag for the national flag was most likely intended by Hopkinson with white outer stripes as on the Great Seal of the United States and on the Bennington flag, which commemorated 50th anniversary of the founding of the United States in 1826.",4,25,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Ironically, the Navy flag was preferred as the national flag.",5,25,== United States Flag ==,11022
"For the various designs, Hopkinson asked for cash in the amount of £2,700.",0,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
Auditor General James Milligan commissioned an evaluation of the request for payment.,1,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
The report from the commissioner of the Chamber of Accounts said that the bill was reasonable and ought to be paid.,2,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
Congress used the usual bureaucratic tactics of asking for an itemized bill for payment in cash.,3,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
Hopkinson requested £9 for the naval flag.,4,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
A committee investigated Hopkinson's charges that his payment was being delayed for arbitrary reasons.,5,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
"The Treasury Board turned down the request in an October 27, 1780, report to Congress.",6,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
"The Board cited several reasons for its action, including the fact that Hopkinson ""was not the only person consulted on those exhibitions of Fancy [that were incidental to the Board (among them, the U.S. flag, the Navy flag, the Admiralty seal, and the Great Seal with a reverse)], and therefore cannot claim the sole merit of them and not entitled in this respect to the full sum charged.""",7,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
The reference to the work of others is most probably a reference to his work on the Great Seal.,8,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Therefore, he would not be eligible to be paid for the Great Seal.",9,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Furthermore, the Great Seal project was still a work in progress.",10,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
No known committee of the Continental Congress was documented with the assignment to design the national flag or naval flag.,11,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Hence, there was no evidence of collaboration with others on Hopkinson's flag design.",12,26,== United States Flag ==,11022
There is no known sketch of a Hopkinson flag—either U.S. or naval—in existence today.,0,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
"However, he incorporated elements of the two flags he designed in his rough sketches of the Great Seal of the United States and his design for the Admiralty Board Seal.",1,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
The rough sketch of his second Great Seal proposal has 7 white stripes and 6 red stripes.,2,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
The impression of Hopkinson's Admiralty Board Seal has a chevron with 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes.,3,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
"The Great Seal reflects Hopkinson's design for a governmental flag, and the Admiralty Board Seal reflects Hopkinson's design for a naval flag.",4,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
Both flags were intended to have 13 stripes.,5,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
"Because the original stars used in the Great Seal had six points, Hopkinson's U.S. flag might also have intended the use of 6-pointed stars.",6,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
This is bolstered by his original sketch for the Great Seal that featured a U.S. flag with six-pointed asterisks for stars.,7,27,== United States Flag ==,11022
