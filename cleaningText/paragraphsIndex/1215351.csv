"Field was born in New York City, New York where he made his Broadway debut as a child in Lady in the Dark (1941) with Gertrude Lawrence. He later danced in the ensembles of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949), Kismet (1954), and The Boy Friend (1955) before deciding to concentrate on choreography.  His first two efforts Nowhere But Up (1962) and Cafe Crown (1964) were unsuccessful, but in 1966 he won his first Tony Award for his dazzling work in the hit Cabaret, the first of several noteworthy successes.
