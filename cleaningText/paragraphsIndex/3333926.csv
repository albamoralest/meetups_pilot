"Born December 12, 1936, in Caruthersville, Missouri, and raised in Osceola, Arkansas, Young's first band was Eddie Bond & the Stompers, a rockabilly band from Memphis, Tennessee, that toured with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, and Roy Orbison during the mid-'50s. By 1958, Young was with singer Johnny Horton, making several appearances on the popular Louisiana Hayride radio show in Shreveport.
",2,== Early career ==
"He was an original member of Bill Black's Combo, which had several instrumental hits in the U.S. in 1959 and the early '60s, the most successful being ""Smokie, Pts. 1 & 2"", ""White Silver Sands,"" and an instrumental version of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" released on Hi Records.  Billboard Magazine listed the Combo as the No. 1 instrumental band three years in a row, 1960–1962.
",3,== Early career ==
"In February 1964, the Beatles requested that the Bill Black Combo open for them during their first U.S. tour.  Subsequently, they invited the Combo over to England for another month-long tour.  After the death of leader Bill Black (Elvis Presley's original bass player) in October 1965, Young concentrated on being a staff musician at Hi Studio in Memphis until 1967, winding up at American Sound Studio at the request of Chips Moman later that year. The Memphis Boys were responsible for around 120 hit singles, pop, country, rock, or soul, between 1967 and 1971.  Young played on the January/February 1969 Elvis Presley sessions that included ""Suspicious Minds"", ""Kentucky Rain"", ""Don't Cry Daddy"", and ""In the Ghetto"". When the studio closed in late 1971, Young moved to Nashville as an independent session player.  He took part in the July 1973 Presley sessions at Stax Records in Memphis which produced the albums Raised On Rock and Good Times.

"In the early 1970s, Young backed Jimmy Buffett as a member of the first three Coral Reefer Bands on ""A White Sport Coat & a Pink Crustacean"", Living and Dying in 3/4 Time and A1A.  On Jimmy's legendary cover of the Lord Buckley classic- ""God's Own Drunk"", Buffett references a ""Reggie Youngin commode huggin drunk"".

"After playing on the sessions for the Highwaymen (Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson) in 1984, Young joined their touring show for a five-year stretch (1990–1995).  Young also played many sessions and concerts with Waylon Jennings, including his final tours featuring the Waymore Blues Band before Jennings' death in 2002.
",6,== Early career ==
"Young was nominated for a Grammy, and also performed at the Kennedy Center in honor of Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. 2008 saw the Country Music Hall of Fame recognizing Young as a ""Nashville Cat"".  That same year also saw the debut of Young's first solo album, the independently released, inspirational Be Still, a collaboration with wife and cellist Jenny Lynn Young.
",7,== Early career ==
"August 2009 saw the Memphis Boys, along with Chips Moman, receive acknowledgement by the Memphis Grammy Chapter for their pioneering work on ""Suspicious Minds"" during a Graceland fan reception.  After almost 45 years of playing together, this was their first award.
