"Her debut short film, Fit (1994), was created for her NYU studies and was shortlisted for the Annual Student Academy Awards. For her MFA thesis, she created her first feature-length film, The Slow Business of Going (2000), a lo-fi/sci-fi road movie, shot in multiple formats (8mm, 16mm, mini-DV and 35 stills) in hotel rooms of nine cities around the world and then transferred the final cut of the film to 35mm. The film premiered at the Thessaloniki International Film Festival in 2000 and won best film at the New York Underground Film Festival in 2002. The film was described by Domitila Bedel in Senses of Cinema as ""a permanent erection for the eye"". The 2002 Village Voice Critics Poll listed it as one of the year’s “best first films” and it now belongs to MoMA’s permanent film collection. Her second feature-length film, Attenberg (2010), premiered in the main competition at the 67th Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Coppa Volpi Award for Best Actress for its protagonist, Ariane Labed.
