"Murphy played on the folk circuit with John Koerner, and the duo recorded Running, Jumping, Standing Still in 1969. The album received positive reviews, Crawdaddy! calling it ""one of the most unique and underrated albums of the folk boom, perhaps the only psychedelic ragtime blues album ever made."" The duo eventually split up, and Koerner pursued an unsuccessful career in filmmaking, temporarily retiring from the music business and moving to Copenhagen, Denmark. Murphy was offered a full-time job with Elektra Records as an in-house producer but declined, choosing to remain in the Minneapolis area.
