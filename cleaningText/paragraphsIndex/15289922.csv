In the 1980s she, Roxanne Shante, and others were engaged in the Roxanne Wars, a series of answer records inspired by UTFO's hit song ""Roxanne, Roxanne"", being the officially sanctioned artist in response to all of the answer records.

It seems that while they tried to create this character, they were having issues with this individual and her mother, so I was told, and that's when I was asked by Paul Anthony if I would audition for the guys, and I said sure, and I did. And, from there, I kept on walking in the shoes of THE REAL Roxanne!'
