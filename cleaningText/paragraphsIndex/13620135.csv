"Initially a member of a band known as the Country Generation, succeeded by the Super Grit Cowboy Band, Wright later performed as a backup vocalist and guitarist for Vern Gosdin. In December 1989, he quit Gosdin's band and wrote Ronnie Milsap's number one single ""A Woman in Love"". Wright signed with Airborne Records in 1989 and released ""She's Got a Man on Her Mind"", which charted at number 38 on Hot Country Songs. (A version of the same song by Conway Twitty charted one year later.) Wright was also slated to release an album titled Slick Hick in March 1990, which would have been produced by himself and Jeff Carlton. However, the album went unreleased due to financial issues with the label. Later in the same year, he co-wrote Shenandoah's ""Next to You, Next to Me"" with Robert Ellis Orrall, and Steve Wariner's top 20 hit ""There for Awhile"". In 1992, Wright signed to Liberty Records, where he released his self-titled debut album that year. This album produced two more low-charting singles. It also included the song ""What's It to You"", which Wright also co-wrote with Orrall. Although Wright's version was never released as a single, Clay Walker later recorded this song on his 1993 debut album, and his version was a number one hit that year. He also co-wrote Shenandoah's 1992 single ""Rock My Baby"". Also in 1992, Wright co-wrote a song with fellow country singer Dennis Robbins and musician Warren Haynes which would become the title track of Robbins first Giant Records album called ""Man With A Plan."" By 1994, Wright joined Orrall to form Orrall & Wright, a duo which charted two singles and recorded one album for Giant Records before disbanding. Wright later wrote Daryle Singletary's 1996 single ""Too Much Fun"".
