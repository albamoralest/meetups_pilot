After acting in Life and Kofuku no Shokutaku, she was chosen to appear in the promotional video for the single released on October 10, 2007 by Little. Between December 2007 and January 2008, she was chosen as the third cheering manager for Japan's High School Soccer Tournament, following Maki Horikita and Yui Aragaki. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress Award at Milano Film Festival in 2014 for her impressive portrayal of a music producer's assistant in ""The Tenor Lirico Spinto.""
