"Born as the daughter of a German mother and Moroccan father, Juju grew up in a poor area in the Berlin district Neuk√∂lln. As a child, she listened to German gangsta rap (Bushido, Aggro Berlin, Sido, etc.) and since she was 14, Juju started rapping as a hobby in her free time. In 2010, she met Nura for the first time. Later they formed the German rap crew SXTN. Their first song was Deine Mutter and their most successful Von Party zu Party (which reached 30 million views on Youtube two years later) and Bongzimmer. In 2018, Nura and Juju separated and began their solo careers. Juju reached the top of the German single charts with the singles ""Melodien"" (with Capital Bra), ""Vermissen"" (with Henning May) and ""Kein Wort"" (with Loredana).
