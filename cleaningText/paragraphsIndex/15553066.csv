"Caspersen started playing bass when he was twelve; for his 12th birthday he bought a bass (his first) instead of a planned bicycle, because a lot of his friends were in bands. He cited Victor Wooten, Les Claypool and Alex Webster as his biggest influences. Alex Webster cited him as the best death metal bass player of his generation. Caspersen is best known for his work with bands such as Spawn of Possession and Blood Red Throne. He also did a number of session jobs for bands like Vile, Decrepit Birth, and Incinerate. He also has a YouTube channel where he covers some Spawn of Possession songs like 'Dead and Grotesque' as well as songs from the album on which he played bass for the band, Spawn of Possession.
