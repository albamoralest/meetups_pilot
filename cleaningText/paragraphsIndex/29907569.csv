"Tom Ardolino was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts.  A fan of the band, he began corresponding and trading tapes with keyboardist and co-founder Terry Adams. This led to him meeting and befriending the band.  At one live show, when original NRBQ drummer Tom Staley did not return for an encore, Adams invited Ardolino to fill in.  He performed well enough that when Staley left the band in 1974, his bandmates agreed that Ardolino was the natural choice as successor. Ardolino remained in the lineup until the band went on hiatus in 2004, returning for occasional performances with Adams, and contributing to solo recordings by Adams (Rhythm Spell and Holy Tweet), by NRBQ (Keep This Love Going and We Travel the Spaceways) and others (see Selected Discography).

"While lead vocals were generally performed by other members of NRBQ, live shows often included a moment where Ardolino would take the spotlight and sing, either with a karaoke backing track or with one of the other band members drumming.

The album consists mostly of basement recordings made in 1971–72.
