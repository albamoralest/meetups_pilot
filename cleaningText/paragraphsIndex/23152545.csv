"Rebelski acts as Doves unofficial fourth member. Rebelski was recommended by a friend of Rob Gretton to play as a session musician for Doves, but soon became the band's touring keyboard player. In addition to playing with Doves on tour, Rebelski has also played on all of the band's albums. 
",2,== Career ==
"Rebelski produced and released his first single ""Scarecrow,"" which was sold at Doves' shows in late winter 2002, and his debut album Thanks for Your Thoughts arrived in March 2003. Rebelski's debut solo live performance was as support for Doves at the band's 27 March gig at the Royal Albert Hall, a benefit for the Teenage Cancer trust. Following a recommendation from Damon Gough, Rebelski signed to Twisted Nerve Records, and recorded his second solo album Stickers on Keys. The album was released in November 2004 to warm critical reception. Rebelski parted ways with Twisted Nerve as his third studio album was ready for release in summer 2007. In late 2008, Rebelski scored the soundtrack to the short film The Value of Hard Work. Also, Rebelski is credited as composer for some of the music included in the BBC 'ecodocumentary': Around the World in 60 Minutes, narrated by David Morrissey and first broadcast on BBC Four on Monday 14 March 2011.
