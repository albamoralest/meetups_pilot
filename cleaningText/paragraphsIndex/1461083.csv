"A native of Denver, Moran studied twelve-tone music privately with Hans Apostel in Vienna and completed his Master of Arts degree in 1963 at Mills College in Oakland, California, where he studied with Darius Milhaud and Luciano Berio (Ruppenthal and Patterson 2001). After having lived for periods ranging from a few months to a couple of years in various locales, from Vienna, Berlin, New York City, and Milan to Portland and San Francisco, he has made Philadelphia his home since 1984. Many of his works have been recorded: his two albums for Argo Records were taken out of print, but reissued as a two CD set by Innova Records, which also released a new CD of his music. Some of his music has been made available in mp3 format at the classical midi archives site (Tyranny and Anon. 2008). The Juniper Tree was issued on CD in 2009.
