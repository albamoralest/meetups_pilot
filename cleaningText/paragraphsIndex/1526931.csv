"Jeffrey Neal ""Jeff"" Pezzati (born February 6, 1960) is the lead singer of the Chicago punk band Naked Raygun. From 1983 to 1985, he also played bass for the band Big Black. In 1980 Pezzati was asked to audition for Naked Raygun (then known as Negro Commando). Pezzati passed the audition and became the band's longest-running member. The band has been credited by Dave Grohl of Nirvana/ Foo Fighters fame for inspiring the then 9 year old Grohl to get into punk music. The band has also been credited with being the ones responsible for Riot Fest being as large as it is. This occurred when the band introduced Mike Petrician to Sean McKeough (of Cobra lounge fame) RIP.
