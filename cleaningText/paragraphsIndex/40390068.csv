"Born and raised in Germany, he first learned guitar at the age of 12 and started to play local clubs. As a well-respected guitar player, he was asked to join the hard rock band Sinner in 1986 to record their 4th album Dangerous Charm. The album was followed by a large European tour. When former Accept-singer Udo Dirkschneider formed his new band U.D.O., he asked Susemihl to join the band, as well as Dieter Rubach (formerly of Accept), Sinner guitarist Mathias Dieth and drummer Thomas Franke, for their Animal House tour. They soon started a US-Tour, which also included Zodiac Mindwarp, Lita Ford and Guns N' Roses, before they recorded their next album Mean Machine. This album, released in 1989 through BMG/Ariola, was produced by Mark Dodson, who also produced Anthrax and Suicidal Tendencies. The album sold 250.000 units worldwide, earning the band the opportunity to play on all the European dates of Ozzy Osbourne's ""No Rest for the Wicked"" tour.

"Following that tour, Susemihl felt a wind of change fanning his creativity. In 1990, Polydor approached him to lay down two tracks for a compilation CD, titled ""Guitar Ballads"" and featured respected guitarists Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Michael Schenker, Gary Moore and Steve Stevens. On the CD, Susemihl wrote, composed and performed two rock-oriented tracks, ""Cloud Nine"" and ""Alley Cat"".
