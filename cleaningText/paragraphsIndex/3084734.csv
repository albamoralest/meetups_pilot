His recuperated voice is said to have not regained the quality and sensitivity he had employed earlier. These limitations resulted in the conception of what would become the Jaipur gayaki.

"Many of these Raags were sung in the Havelis in northern Rajasthan, where Khansahab grew up. From Haveli Sangeet tradition, Khansahab brought many of the Raags in the realm of live concerts and also created Raags and Bandishes rooted in them. One of the Raags he resurrected was Raag Basanti Kanada. Few of the many Haveli sangeet dhrupads which he made into bandishes were the famous Raag Nayaki Kanada Bandish ""Mero Piya Rasiya"" and Bihagda Bandish ""Ae Pyaari pag hole"".

Khansahab's brother helped grow the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana after Khansahab's death. Manji Khan, the second son*, died early in 1937, so it was Bhurji Khan, the youngest son, who passed on the gayaki of his father.
