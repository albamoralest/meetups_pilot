"Lee met Joe Jonas in 2009, when touring with the Jonas Brothers. She was the only female in the band, and when asked about it said, ""It's the best thing ever...because they are very simple. Guys are so simple and easy. I don't know, I love working with guys. It's always been like that for my career. I was the only female in the band the entire time, so I'm very used to it. I'm very comfortable, and they're funny and silly.""
