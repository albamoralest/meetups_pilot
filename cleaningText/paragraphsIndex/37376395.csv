"Scott Murphy began playing with pop punk band Allister on bass and vocals in 1998.  They were one of the first bands to sign to California based record label Drive-Thru Records, and have released five studio albums — 1999's Dead Ends and Girlfriends, 2002's Last Stop Suburbia (which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.), 2005's Before the Blackout, 2010's Countdown to Nowhere, and 2012's ""Life Behind Machines"" — Allister also made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film Sleepover. While on tour in Japan for the first time in 2001 for a string of sold out shows, Murphy became intrigued by the culture and language of Japan, and after learning basic phrases to say from stage, he began studying Japanese on his own.  During a stint at the South by Southwest music festival in Austin, TX, Allister met and became close with Japanese rock band Ellegarden, and they were soon invited to a two and a half month/ 40 date tour of Japan together in 2006.  On this tour, Allister released the album Guilty Pleasures (EP), on which Murphy sang most of the songs in Japanese, and the CD went on to sell over 250,000 copies.  The following year, Allister member Tim Rogner found out that he was to become a father, and the band announced their intention to go on hiatus, but resumed activity again in 2010.
