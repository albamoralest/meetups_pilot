"Shindell's songwriting often involves storytelling from a first-person point of view: an INS officer and illegal immigrant in ""Fishing"", a World War II soldier in ""Sparrows Point"", a Confederate drummer boy in ""Arrowhead"", an Argentine grandmother in ""Abuelita"", and a power broker in ""Confession"". His other personae include a New York City cab driver in ""The Last Fare of the Day"", a man on death row in ""Ascent"", a war widow in ""Reunion Hill"", and Mary Magdalene.

"Shindell's career received a boost in 1997 when Joan Baez recorded three of his songs (""Fishing"", ""Reunion Hill"", and ""Money for Floods"") for her album Gone from Danger and invited the aspiring singer-songwriter to join her 1997â€“98 tour.

"Shindell collaborated with Dar Williams and Lucy Kaplansky to form the group Cry Cry Cry. On their eponymous 1998 album, Cry Cry Cry covered an eclectic mix of songwriters. The trio toured in support of their album before resuming solo careers. In 2017-2018 the group reunited briefly. The resulting tour culminated in a live recording of their final show on April 15, 2018, at The Freight and Salvage in Berkeley, CA, all proceeds of which went to support Live Music Society.
