"2015 saw a major direction change, Chris released 5 tracks on Ultra Records. The first was a single ""Chest""; which NestHQ hailed as ""best described by what it isn't. It's not a frilly banger, it's not an esoteric deep cut. There's no sing-a-long happening here. Rather, Chris Lake has simplified his production to let all of the necessary elements shine"". Following this was ""Piano Hand"", a collaboration with Chris Lorenzo, which was premiered on Annie Mac's BBC Radio 1 show and on Billboard. Two months after, Lake's collaboration with Anna Lunoe, ""Stomper"" was released and premiered on YourEDM, where it was acknowledged as ""a charging house tune that received play throughout the entire festival circuit"". During September, ""Stranger"" was released and got played at nearly every major festival throughout the US, according to 1001tracklists. Coinciding with this September release was a 3-month North American tour where he played at a handful of notable festivals and venues such as Hard Day of the Dead, Foundation Nightclub, and U Street Music Hall. His last release of 2015 was another collaboration with Chris Lorenzo called ""The Calling"". Their second collaboration was premiered on Mixmag and they were hailed as a ""seemingly perfect match"". Alongside these 5 originals, he also released the remix of Calvin Harris & Disciple's ""How Deep is Your Love"", which had received over 80 million streams accumulative and was one of the most popular house remixes on Soundcloud of the year.
