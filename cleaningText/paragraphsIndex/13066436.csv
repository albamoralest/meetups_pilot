"Karl Gustaf Ingvar Wixell (May 7, 1931 – October 8, 2011) was a Swedish baritone who had an active international career in operas and concerts from 1955 to 2003. He mostly sang roles from the Italian repertory, and, according to The New York Times, ""was best known for his steady-toned, riveting portrayals of the major baritone roles of Giuseppe Verdi — among them Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra, Amonasro in Aida, and Germont in La traviata"".

"Wixell performed all the songs in the competition to select Sweden's Eurovision Song Contest 1965 entry. The winning song was ""Annorstädes Vals"" (Elsewhere Waltz), which Wixell went on to perform at the international final in Naples. In a break from the then prevailing tradition, the song was sung in English (as ""Absent Friend""). This led to the introduction from 1966 onwards of a rule stipulating that each country's entry must be sung in one of the languages of that country.
