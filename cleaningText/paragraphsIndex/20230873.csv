"In 1999 Haywood was nominated for two ARIA Music Awards: for Best Jazz Recording for Sudden in a Shaft of Sunlight by Browne-Haywood-Stevens and Best Adult Contemporary for Beat Club  by The Black Sorrows. The Melbourne International Arts Festival has provided several opportunities to showcase Haywood's composing and performing talents. In 2001 he performed with his band Dodge in the Spiegeltent. An anniversary concert of John Sangster's Lord of the Rings at the Malvern Town Hall in 2003 also featured Haywood with many of the original musicians. Haywood, Eugene Ball, and Andrea Keller were the nucleus of the eleven piece Bennetts Lane Big Band which was formed in 2001. The band has been described by the National Library of Australia as ""Melbourne's premier large contemporary jazz ensemble"" and ""comprised of some of Australia's most celebrated improvisers and composers.""'A grant from the Alan C. Rose Memorial Project in 2004 enabled Haywood to study in New York City with American jazz bassists Gary Peacock and Rufus Reid. Later that year he completed a Master of Music Performance degree at the Victorian College of the Arts.
