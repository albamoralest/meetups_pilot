"Gretlund set up 7A Records with radio and television broadcaster Iain Lee as a hobby/side project in 2015. The label specialises in reissuing rare and obscure releases connected to 1960s group the Monkees. In July 2015, it was announced that the label's first release would be a limited gatefold vinyl edition of Micky Dolenz's original MGM Records singles. This was followed by the first ever reissue of Bobby Hart's solo album, The First Bobby Hart Solo Album in December 2015. In November 2017 the label released the critically acclaimed album, Micky Dolenz's Out Of Nowhere, featuring the 30 piece American Metropole Orchestra. 7A Records' biggest release to date came in 2018 with Michael Nesmith & The First National Band Redux - Live At The Troubadour which gave the label widespread recognition. Michael Nesmith was quoted saying that the album is the best he has ever done. In 2020, 7a Records announced on social media that Gretlund had bought Iain Lee's shares in the company. In August 2020, Rolling Stone Magazine reported that Gretlund and 7A Records had signed a new recording deal with Micky Dolenz for an album called 'Dolenz Sings Nesmith'  The album was released in May 2021 and received international critical acclaim, including a 4 star review in Mojo Magazine.
