"On December 12, 1919, Frank and Helen were on board the steamship SS President, from Los Angeles back to their home in Seattle.  Frank reported that Helen had gone on deck for a walk at 4 a.m. and never returned.  After a search failed to turn up the missing Mrs. Ferera, she was presumed lost at sea. In 1924, Frank played guitar accompaniment to Vernon Dalhart's ballad ""Wreck of the Old 97"" (Victor Record No. 19427), sometimes cited as the first million-selling country music release in the American record industry. In the late 1920s, during a wave of Hawaiian music popularity, Frank Ferera's Hawaiian Trio recorded a number of songs with jazz singer Annette Hanshaw, including: ""Was It A Dream?"", ""For Old Time's Sake"", ""Get Out and Get Under the Moon"", ""I Love A Ukulele"", ""Lonely Nights In Hawaii"", ""Chiquita"", ""Maui Girl"", ""Sonny Boy"", ""Sweet Lei Lehua"", ""Carolina Moon"", ""Maui Chimes"", ""Pagan Love Song"", ""Singing in the Rain"", ""Ua No a Like - Sweet Constancy"", and ""Forget Me Not"", ""Lazy Louisiana Moon"", and ""Pale Blue Waters"".
