"Finzer has released several solo albums, and multiple collections in supergroups.  In 2006 she teamed up with acoustic and electric guitarist Ric Flauding to release her debut album Desert Journey, a collection of new age and world music instrumentals arranged for flute and guitar.  The first of Finzer's Sanctuary albums followed in 2009, and in the same year she and harpist VeeRonna Ragone formed Dulce VAS, releasing a jazz fusion, Latin flair Christmas album of traditional holiday songs performed as mambos, sambas and rhumbas entitled Christmas Picante.  In 2010, she released Masquerade and Radiant Sky, the latter being a second album with Flauding and a host of other musicians, including fellow flutist Tina Beaton, percussionist Freddie Colon, and guitarists Will Chapin, Pedro Perez and Evan Drummond. In 2011, Finzer has released several solo albums, including her Sanctuary trilogy, Acceptance, and her recent ""naked flute"" series recorded in an empty water silo at The Tank in Rangely, CO.  The first in this series, inspired by the solo recordings of Paul Horn, Transcendence, was released in 2019 with two more to follow in 2020. Having found a unique voice and interest in the subgenre of ""healing music"", she collaborated with guitarist Darin Mahoney in 2013 for the release of Transformation an album the two artists composed to foster an emotional experience for those faced with life-threatening illnesses - most specifically cancer, of which Mahoney is a survivor.  The album was engineered by John Herrera at Clamsville Studios and won One World Music UK's Album of the Year award in 2013.  Finzer's 2014 release of Sanctuary III: Beyond the Dream, received widespread acclaim and award nominations - most notably on the long running NPR show Echoes.  The album's closing track ""Song For Rex"" garnered considerable attention as a piece composed for her grandson with Down Syndrome.  Hundreds of children with DS submitted their photos for use in the song's video. Finzer has also collaborated with Native American Flutist Mark Holland on Flute Flight. and Somewhere New - albums of ambient and atmospheric music performed on concert flutes (c flute, alto flute, bass and contrabass flute), Native American Flutes and the addition of synths, piano and percussion.  2016 brought three new collaborative albums from Finzer into the Heart Dance Records catalog - 'Trialogue' a world/americana style album with guitarist Darin Mahoney  and seven-time GRAMMY Nominee and pan-global percussionist Will Clipman, Majestica - 'In the Midst of Stars' with Cass Anawaty, and a meditational album with Tom Moore titled Whispers from Silence.

"Sherry Finzer's sound is influenced by the artists she collaborates with, and by the instruments she uses.  She incorporates a variety of flutes in her compositions, where wind instruments are mixed with Gregorian chants, ethereal sounds, natural and other ethnic arrangements to create her soundscapes.  She mixes modern electronic modes and Eastern scales and melodies that evoke an air of mystery and intrigue.  Critic RJ Lannan, of Zone Music Reporter, describes her compositions as “deeply haunting…calms and yet piques the senses,” and compared some of her more thematic works to “a rush of water in a desert gorge.” Lannan goes on to liken the often empyrean suggestions in her work as ""comets and asteroids zooming through space...with the music becoming a springboard for...playful fantasies.” Echoes Radio show host, John Diliberto, intimates that her sound ""explor[es] a deeper modality hovering between new age meditations and ambient chamber music.""
