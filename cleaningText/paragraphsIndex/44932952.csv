"Early in her entertainment career, Okada presented a majime (真面目, lit. 'serious'  or 'earnest') persona, such as by establishing rules of conduct for her fellow 14th generation members and consistently speaking in a formal manner.

Okada is a supporter of the LGBT community. Okada is also known for her close friendship with Team 4 captain Yuiri Murayama; both of them have always been members of Team 4 since joining AKB48.
