"In early March 2006, Peccatum announced their end leaving more time for their own individual projects. In October 2006, Tveitan announced a collaboration with the Japanese author Kenji Siratori. Siratori provided lyrics, spoken word vocals and the music video to the track ""Neo Drugismo"", which appeared on the second Starofash album The Thread. Musically, Starofash uses experimental soundscapes over constantly changing sonic sceneries, where the compelling melody is often the leading thread from beginning to end. Tveitan currently lives in the woods of Telemark, where she writes music and lyrics, and pursues her interest in photography.
