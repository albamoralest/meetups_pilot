"Avriel Benjamin Kaplan was born and raised in Visalia, California on April 17, 1989. He has two older siblings; brother Joshua, and sister Esther (now Koop). Koop served as the tour manager for Pentatonix from 2012 to 2019. Kaplan and his family are Jewish, which was the cause of repeated bullying as a child. Kaplan loved folk music, and frequently went to the nearby Sequoia National Park, which became an inspiration for his music. He considers his earliest musical inspirations to be Simon & Garfunkel, John Denver, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Bill Withers. Later inspirations include Iron & Wine, Bon Iver, Ben Harper, and José González. After graduating high school, Kaplan attended Mt. San Antonio College, where he studied opera and choral studies. The college is known for its strong choral and a cappella programs.

"Before joining Pentatonix, Kaplan was already an accomplished a cappella artist, performing in the styles of jazz and opera among others. During his time in college, he joined the all-male a cappella group Fermata Nowhere. In 2009, the group became the first community college act to win the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCAs). During the finals, he won the award for ""Best Rhythm Section"", making him the first vocal bass to receive the award. Before his victory, the award was called ""Best Vocal Percussionist"". In his junior year of college, he joined the vocal jazz ensemble Singcopation. In his first year as a member, the ensemble won the Monterrey Jazz Festival Competition.

"Kaplan joined Pentatonix in 2011, when original members Kirstin Maldonado, Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying were searching for a bass singer and a beatboxer. The group met the day before the auditions for the third season of The Sing-Off began. The group successfully auditioned for the show and eventually went on to win the title for 2011 (season three). Kaplan acted as the group's vocal bass, but frequently sang lead parts as well.

"On April 29, 2017, Kaplan released his first solo song, ""Fields and Pier"", under the name Avriel & the Sequoias. His debut EP, Sage and Stone, was released on June 9, 2017. On May 12, 2017, Kaplan announced that he would be leaving Pentatonix following their scheduled tour. In a video announcing his departure, he stated that although he loved being in the group, it was difficult for him to keep up with the group's demanding schedule, which required him to spend less time with his family. His final show with Pentatonix was held at the Champlain Valley Fair in Essex Junction, Vermont on September 3, 2017. In October 2019, Kaplan announced a European tour, his first since leaving Pentatonix.
