"After cutting his early musical teeth in a R&B band, the Wizards, Kavana moved to London in the late 1970s.  He got a job at Rock on Records, replacing Philip Chevron, who was leaving to work full-time with his band, The Radiators From Space. In 1977, Kavana put together Kavana's Krisis Band, playing regularly at Islington's Hope & Anchor, a hot spot of the 1970s London soul scene.  This band evolved into Juice on the Loose, who became something of a house band for Ace Records, with Kavana as band leader and producer.  During this era, Kavana and members of the band toured and recorded with many legendary American acts, including Big Jay McNeely, Clarence ""Frogman"" Henry, Willie Egan, Dr. John, Doug Sahm, Augie Meyers and Flaco Jiminez, Wallace Davenport, Gatemouth Brown, Memphis Slim, Champion Jack Dupree, and Slim Gaillard. Kavana appears on Juice on the Loose's self-titled album, released on Line Records in 1981. Other Juice on the Loose recordings would surface on Kavana's first solo album, Rollin' & Coastin'.

"In the mid/late 1980s, Kavana opened several tours for The Pogues, including a December/January 1985/1986 jaunt through Ireland where he performed as a duo with Elvis Costello.  Pogues management considered Kavana as a replacement for departing bass player/singer Cait O'Riordan. The band chose road crew member Darryl Hunt for the job, but Kavana makes several appearances on The Pogues' album If I Should Fall From Grace With God, and co-wrote two songs with Pogue Terry Woods: ""Every Man Is A King (In The U.S. of A.)"" and ""Young Ned of the Hill"", the former released originally as a B-side and the latter included on The Pogues album Peace and Love.

"After quitting The Pogues, Woods joined with Kavana and formed a new band, The Bucks.  This line-up recorded the album Dancing to the ceili band, released in 1994 on WEA. The album and the band's live shows were well received by fans and critics, but the group disbanded after a short time.  Kavana cites lack of label support as a reason, and claims he ""never got a penny"" for the album. Returning to the Alias Band, Kavana recorded Galway to Graceland (ARK 002) in 1995.  The album was self-financed and produced independently.  Due to financial difficulties it was deleted before getting a full release.
