"Pullman Gerald ""Tommy"" Pederson (August 15, 1920, Minnesota – January 16, 1998) was an American trombonist and composer – prolific in jazz, big band, and classical genres. He had performed and recorded with big bands and artists that included Gene Krupa, Tommy Dorsey, Nelson Riddle, Doc Severinsen (late 1960s), and Frank Sinatra. He was also a prolific studio musician for movie soundtracks, television and radio shows, and other recordings – sometimes playing as many as six studio sessions a day. Pederson's marriage to Kathryn Reed ended in divorce.
