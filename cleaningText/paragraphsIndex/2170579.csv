",5,== Biography ==
"Torn was born in Amityville, New York, United States, he is married to Linda B. Brecht-Torn (b. 1952), is the son of Lawrence J. Torn (1926-2017) and Rhoda G. Torn (1927-2010), the father of electronic musician Elijah B. Torn (b. 1979) and Cody M. Torn (b. 1983). He is the brother of Marsha Torn and Linda Torn, and he was a cousin of actor Rip Torn (1931-2019), Angelica Torn (b. 1964), and Ina Garten (The Barefoot Contessa).
",6,== Biography ==
"Torn began his career with the Ithaca-based jam band Zobo Funn Band in the 1970s, and rose to prominence as a member of The Everyman Band and Jan Garbarek's quartet in the mid-1980s. He has recorded solo and group recordings for the ECM, Windham Hill, CMP and 75 Ark labels.
",7,== Biography ==
"In the 1990s, Torn was diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, in his case, a life-threatening form of brain tumor. The surgery that followed left him deaf in the right ear but he remains able to compose, record, and play. He mixes many widely available recordings himself, although according to him this requires sitting sideways to the studio speakers and ""visualising the stereo aspects of sound"" in his head rather than experimenting with them by ear. In 2006, Torn's film score for Believe in Me won the Best Score-award at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. In 2003, his score for the film The Order was nominated for a Grammy Award.
",8,== Biography ==
"In 2007, Torn released Prezens with Tim Berne. Jazzwise called the album ""a vibrating collage full of shimmering sonic shapes, a dark, urban electronic soundscape – a potent mix of jazz, free-form rock and technology that is both demanding and rewarding.""In 2013, Torn performed as a guitarist on David Bowie's penultimate album, The Next Day—his third collaboration with the artist. The same year, Torn delivered a solo guitar performance and talk at TEDx Caltech 2013: The Brain. The presentation examined his brain tumor diagnosis and recovery.
