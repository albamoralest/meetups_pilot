"Jaime St. James (born January 27, 1960) is the lead vocalist and primary songwriter of the glam metal band Black 'N Blue. He also served briefly in the mid-2000s as the lead singer of Warrant, but he left upon the return of the band's original lead singer Jani Lane in 2008. He sang (and co-wrote several tracks) on Warrant's 2006 album Born Again. Born James Pond, St. James started out playing drums, as he had fantasized about being a rock drummer during his youth. He began his professional music career while a student at Cleveland High School, where he and classmates Dan Kurth, Barry Pendergrass, and Ray Malsom formed the Molly Hatchet-inspired combo Jet. Pond and Jet are featured prominently in the 1977 Legend, the yearbook of Cleveland High School. The band was briefly a favorite among Portland's high school crowd, and his version of the ZZ Top song ""La Grange"" was an early hint of his future fame. It was also during high school that Pond met his then-classmate and fellow musician, Tommy Thayer, creating a friendship that has lasted to the present.  He and Thayer formed a band that ultimately evolved into Black 'n Blue, which gave the two their first taste of mainstream success. Following Black N' Blue, St. James performed with the bands Freight Train Jane, The Glorious Things (which also featured former Warrant guitarist Billy Morris), and his own band St. James, which Billy Morris guested with.
