At the age of 8, he made the album The World Champion Kid Drummer with Austrian jazz players in Vienna, including Hans Koller, Ernst Landl, and the Hot Club of Vienna for Elite Special.  At the age of 9, his drumming won him the 1947 MGM-Jazz Competition in Budapest. As a result, he made several recordings with the Chappy's Mopex Big Band for His Master's Voice.
