"Distel was the son of Russian-French emigre Léonide Distel who was born in Odessa (Russian Empire) and French-Jewish pianist Andrée Ventura (1902–1965), born in Constantinople. His uncle, bandleader Ray Ventura, promoted jazz in the 1930s and was involved with swing in France. After Ventura settled in Paris with his orchestra Les Collégiens, Distel gave up piano and switched to guitar. In 1948, Ventura invited Distel to hear Dizzy Gillespie perform with his orchestra, along with Bruno Coquatrix, Paul Misraki, and André Hornez. Distel's efforts led to the orchestra's split into two rival bands: Guy Wormser's New Orleans band and the cool jazz and bebop aficionados led by Distel. After meeting Hubert Damisch, a saxophonist, Distel founded the band that would allow him to be with the leaders. With help from Jean Marie Ingrand (bass), Mimi Perrin (piano), and Jean-Louis Viale (drums), the band won the Coliseum's Night of Jazz Meilleur Petit Orchestre Moderne award, with Damisch and Distel winning prizes on the same night.

"Distel became a professional jazz guitarist. During his career he worked with Dizzy Gillespie and Tony Bennett. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in the late 1950s after establishing himself as a French crooner. He rose to fame in 1958 with the song ""Brigitte"", a homage to Brigitte Bardot, with a photo of the couple on the cover. In the 1960s, he composed ""La Belle Vie"", a tune that made its way across the Atlantic as ""The Good Life"" and performed by Tony Bennett. French lyrics were added in the 1970s and it became Distel's signature tune. During the 1960s, he had a variety show on French television. His only British hit single came in 1970 with a cover of ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"", the Oscar-winning Burt Bacharach/Hal David song from the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Distel's version reached No. 10 in the UK. In the 1970s, he became popular outside France and hosted the Miss World contest in London in 1977.
