"His first official single ""Harlem Shake"", was released on Mad Decent subsidiary Jeffrees as a free giveaway offered via SoundCloud on May 22, 2012. It was first played by Rustie in his BBC Radio 1 essential mix before being given Pitchfork's Best New Track distinction. The rapper El-P recorded a freestyle over the track for Pitchfork TV. In the months following, online comedian and musician George Miller, known by his stage name Joji, recorded a video dancing to the song with his friends, which consequently grew into a YouTube viral video sensation as thousands of fans, artists, personalities and brands filmed their own versions to the track. Key videos were recorded by Good Morning America and The Simpsons. After a change to the Billboard chart rules in 2013, ""Harlem Shake"" became the first US number 1 produced exclusively by streaming. YouTube produced an Easter egg customisation for the song, where their user interface would appear to shake at the start of the first verse. ""Harlem Shake"" is certified double platinum in the United States. At the time of releasing his debut album Aa in 2016, Baauer, Adele and Drake held the record for top streams achieved in a week. ""Harlem Shake"" won Dance Song of the Year and EDM Song of the Year at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.
