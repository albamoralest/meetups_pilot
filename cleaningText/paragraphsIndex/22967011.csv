"Calchaquismo is a musical movement created by the pianist in 1998. The main characteristics start from the encounter of Argentine folk dances with the improvisation of contemporary jazz and rock music. Danzas and Andean rhythms such as comparsa salteña, carnavalito, pim pin, bailecito, la zamba salteña, kaluyo, la vidala and huayno are approached with new compositions, arrangements and instrumentation. It takes the name of ""calchaquismo"" inspired by the airs and melodies of the Valles Calchaquíes, Valle de Lerma and the Quebrada de Humahuaca in the Argentine provinces of Salta and Jujuy.
