"During the band's recording career from 1980–1983, they released two studio albums, four singles and three extended plays—one of which was recorded with the late British recording star Lonnie Donegan. A 1983 compilation album was released shortly after the group's disbandment, and a live album followed in 2001. Although the band did not enjoy any major chart successes, their work was generally well received by critics. They earned a fan base through their energetic live performances, which were originally honed on the streets of Glasgow and later exhibited via their extensive touring and a number of television appearances. In recent years, their work has been described as having helped define the short-lived rockabilly revival of the early 1980s.

"The Shakin' Pyramids originally formed in the late 1970s as buskers and quickly gained a reputation for their live performances on the streets of Glasgow. The band then spent time in France writing material and developing their sound while using their busking skills to pay their way. Upon returning to Scotland, The Shakin' Pyramids signed a record deal with Cuba Libre, a subsidiary of Virgin Records.

"The band's first song for the label, ""Reeferbilly Boogie"", was recorded in 1980 on a four-track recorder at the Hellfire club in Glasgow, and was unexpectedly named ""Single of the Week"" by NME. Their first EP, entitled Take a Trip, was released the following year. The title track appeared on their debut album, entitled Skin 'Em Up (1981), which was released to positive reviews, notably receiving perfect review ratings in popular publications such as NME and Rolling Stone, as well as being cited in later years as a favourite among rockabilly collectors. AllMusic, who also praised the record, described it as having ""helped define the short-lived rockabilly revival of the early '80s."" The album was promoted by a single, ""Tennessee Rock 'n 'Roll"", which was also released as an EP featuring original b-side ""Alright Alnight"" and two new tracks. That year, the band increased their profile by recording and releasing a third and final EP with the late British recording star Lonnie Donegan, who has been described by the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums as ""Britain's most successful and influential recording artist before The Beatles.""The band's second and final studio album, Celts and Cobras (1982) – on the cover of which they were billed as ""Shakin' Pyramids"" – was more diverse in its style but was not as warmly received as the band's debut release. Trouser Press declared that ""The band still rocks, but they'd better figure out where they're going."" ""Pharaoh's Chant"" was released as the album's first single, followed by ""Just A Memory""   The band toured with Men at Work in 1983, playing Celts and Cobras to larger audiences. At the peak of their popularity, the band played to audiences worldwide, as well as making a number of television appearances. Ultimately, Celts and Cobras was seen as a departure from their original sound, and the group disbanded in 1983, midway through a Canadian tour.
