"Jordan was a teenager when he became an honorary member of Stevie Wonder’s band ""WonderLove"". He also was a substitute drummer in the band ""Stuff"" in 1976  and played with Joe Cocker on his American tour. Later, he played drums for the Saturday Night Live band in the 1970s. When John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd toured as The Blues Brothers in the late 1970s, Jordan was their drummer, and recorded on their resulting albums, credited as Steve ""Getdwa"" Jordan. He did not, however, appear in the movie of the same name. Jordan also played in the New York ""24th Street Band"" with  Will Lee, Clifford Carter, and Hiram Bullock which later became Paul Shaffer and the World's Most Dangerous Band, which played on Late Night with David Letterman from 1982 to 1986.

"Jordan, along with fellow Shaffer alumnus Anton Fig, appeared on the Rolling Stones' 1986 release Dirty Work, playing percussion, not drums, contrary to rumors. Keith Richards then hired Jordan to play on Aretha Franklin's cover of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" for a film of the same name. According to Richards, Jordan kept asking Richards on the plane ride home from the recording session with Franklin in Detroit, to be included in the upcoming documentary by Taylor Hackford Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, a tribute to Chuck Berry. Richards had been hoping to include Charlie Watts in the project but when this proved unfeasible, Jordan was hired and he appeared in many scenes with Berry and Richards. The success of this project led to Jordan's membership in Keith Richards and the X-pensive Winos, a band that toured and recorded three albums, Talk is Cheap (1988), Main Offender (1992), and Crosseyed Heart (2015). Jordan co-produced all three albums and is credited with songwriting, along with Richards. One of these collaborations made it onto the Billboard Hot 100 via the Rolling Stones Steel Wheels album version in 1989: ""Almost Hear You Sigh"" peaked at number 50 (U.S.) and 31 (U.K.) in December of that year.
