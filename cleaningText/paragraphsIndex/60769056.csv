"Laura was born in the United States to Cambodian refugee parents and attended University of California, Berkeley.  Her mother, Thida Mam, had been raised to be free and expressive as a child and sing publicly. Laura's parents wanted her and her brother to feel fully American, and raised them speaking English. However, Laura's mother sang her Khmer lullabies, and gave her Cambodian dancing lessons, so she would have an appreciation of the culture of Cambodia. In 2018, Laura won an arts and Culture prize from the Women of the Future Awards South East Asia.
