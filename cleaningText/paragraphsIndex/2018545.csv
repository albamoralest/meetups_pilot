"The first single Do released was the song ""Real Good"". Although the music video was played a lot on the Dutch music channel TMF, it was not a hit song in the Netherlands. Later in an interview, she says that ""It wasn't my sound, and I hated the video. Thankfully it wasn't a hit, 'cause I don't want people to remember me from that song"".

"After that, Do collaborated with DJ Sammy and Yanou, who is also her producer. The song was a cover of Bryan Adams song Heaven. It became an international hit. It reached the number one spot in the United Kingdom and was a Top ten hit in several countries. A candlelight remix version was made with a slower, piano instrumental. During this time, she had some problems with the credits of the song. Everywhere she went, she was asked if she was DJ Sammy because the song (in accordance with most dance songs) was credited to DJ Sammy, and she was the main focus in the video. Her candlelight version of ""Heaven"" is also used for the ending sequence of the TV series Cold Case, 1st-season episode 8 'Fly Away'.
