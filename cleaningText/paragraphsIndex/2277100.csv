"Born in British Hong Kong in 5 November 1971, he was a youth development footballer and coach until 17. At age 17, Leung became a finalist in the eighth annual New Talent Singing Awards (新秀歌唱大賽) in 1989, which won him a contract with Capital Artists. He made his recording debut in 1990 with the release of Listen to the Edge (細聽鋒芒). He propelled to teen idol stardom in the mid-1990s and was famous for his rather feminine look, in which many of his songs portray the life of timid men dumped by their lovers. He was suspended and barred from performing or appearing on variety shows by TVB for three months after he uttered profanity during a live broadcast of the Tung Wah Charity Show in 1995.

"In 2001, Capital Artists failed in the market, and Leung was left contract-less for over a year. During this time, Leung began composing music and was the leader of William So's concert band, while also learning to play the piano. Under the guidance of Paco Wong, he signed to Gold Typhoon in 2003, being marketed as a singer-songwriter. That same year, he released his first album under Gold Typhoon, Number 10, which won Best Album of the Year at the Ultimate Song Chart awards.
