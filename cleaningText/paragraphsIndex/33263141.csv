"Both Salisbury and Wayne Coyne, lead singer of the Flaming Lips, are responsible for a distinct visual style that is the band's trademark for both their live shows and the album cover designs and packaging.
",4,== The Flaming Lips (1994–present) ==
"One of Salisbury's earliest contributions to the Flaming Lips' live shows, is the ""Flames of Destiny"" flaming cymbal. Salisbury orchestrated and executed the feat by filling an inverted cymbal on a stand with alcohol and then lighting it on fire while the band played in the background. His eye is featured along with the tongue of J. Michelle Martin-Coyne on the cover of Yeah, I Know It's a Drag... But Wastin' Pigs Is Still Radical EP in 1991. Salisbury, along with Wayne Coyne and Bradley Beesley, co-directed Christmas on Mars a full-length feature film released in 2008.
