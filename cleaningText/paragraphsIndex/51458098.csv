"Boasting a distinct style akin to that of French musician and producer CloZee, Fakear's music is best described as ""world bass,"" a term also used to describe CloZee's music. Many of his song are characterized by East Asian influences; there's an emphasis on melody, transparency, the focus on individual instruments, and the use of word orientation. Specifically, Japanese influences. 
",2,== Musical style and influence ==
"Japanese music often looks to represent natural sounds—and the sounds of life itself—through the use of percussion, wind and string instruments. In traditional Japanese music, there is a noticeable absence of regular chords and a sparse rhythm. All of the rhythms are 'ma'-based and silence is an important part of the songs. Many of these aspects of Japanese music can be heard in Fakear's music.
