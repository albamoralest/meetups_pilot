"He was born in Oxford, Mississippi to Jimmy Mathis and Jeanella (Malvezzi) Mathis.  His genealogy is of Scottish and Italian origin.  His early life was filled with music, as his father and relatives were skilled instrumentalists and singers.  He began joining the family musical circle at an early age and by age eight was proficient at mandolin.  By 15, Mathus had been taught the rudiments of guitar, piano and harmony singing.  The family's repertoire consisted of hundreds of folk, bluegrass, country blues and pre-recorded songs passed down through the Mathus and Byrd families.  His father was an avid outdoorsman, traveler and also raised hunting dogs and horses.  Thus, Mathus' early life consisted of hunting and fishing in the Corinth, Mississippi, area.
",2,== Early life and career ==
"Mathus was involved in rock and roll in Corinth High School and was recorded first in 1983 at Sam Phillips Memphis Recording Service in Memphis, Tennessee, in a group called The End.  He also helped found Johnny Vomit & The Dry Heaves, which was one of the first punk rock/experimental noise bands in the state of Mississippi.
",3,== Early life and career ==
"He left home at age 17 to study philosophy at Mississippi State University and began writing songs and performing in the Starkville, Mississippi, area.  He was recorded and records released in the mid-1980s under the name Cafe des Moines.  In 1987, Mathus joined the Merchant Marines working as a deckhand and tankerman for the Canal Barge Company on the Mississippi, Illinois and Tennessee Rivers.  He used his shore leave to travel the country, usually alone, camping and sleeping in his pickup truck.  Upon a chance trip to North Carolina, he decided to move to the Chapel Hill area and began his music career in earnest.
",4,== Early life and career ==
"Educating himself in the libraries of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Mathus learned Latin, studied theater, poetry, First Peoples culture, literature and medieval alchemy, as well as music. It was during this time that he changed the spelling of his last name from ""Mathis"" to ""Mathus,"" to reflect his respect for his and his mother's Latin studies.  He was first known in this area as a drummer, with his group – Metal Flake Mother.

"In 1993, Mathus met and soon married Katharine Whalen. Together they formed Squirrel Nut Zippers.  This group used Mathus' knowledge of theater, early American music and leadership along with Whalen's fashion and vocal style. The group toured extensively throughout the 1990s, appearing at many prestigious events, including A Prairie Home Companion, the second inauguration of Bill Clinton, and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Over the years they also performed on television programs, including The Tonight Show, Late Night with David Letterman, Conan O'Brien and Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve in 1998. Their albums have been awarded gold and platinum records by the Recording Industry Association of America, and Billboard chart history includes No. 18 for the album Perennial Favorites, and No. 27 for the album Hot.

"In the mid-1990s, Mathus' frequent trips back to Mississippi led to his meeting Jim and Luther Dickinson, which resulted in Mathus writing and recording ""(Jas. Mathus & His Knockdown Society) Play Songs for Rosetta"".  This was a benefit project to aid Mathus' childhood nanny, Rosetta Patton, daughter of Charley Patton. This rekindled Mathus' interest in Mississippi music and set him on a new path.  During this time, Mathus also began recording and producing on his own.

"The Squirrel Nut Zippers disbanded in 2000.  Mathus and Whalen divorced in 2003, at which time Mathus returned to his home state of Mississippi.

In 2007, Mathus relocated the studio to Como, Mississippi.
