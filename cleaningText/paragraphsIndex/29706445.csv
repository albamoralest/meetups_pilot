He transfers the folklore into an entirely new quality, at the same time giving it a new dimension of universality. Characteristic for his creative works is that he doesn't use just any folklore idiom, but the one of the rustic singing, which offers enormous opportunities for specific harmonic treatments through multi-layer accord sounding and polyphonic conducting of the structure. Stojkov doesn't focus on one stylistic region. He is in a continuous search for new sounds and soundings, which arouse from the way of using the selection of folk and classical instruments.
