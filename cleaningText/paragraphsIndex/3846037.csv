"Born to a Maronite Christian family in the coastal small town of Jubeil (Byblos), she holds both Lebanese and Canadian citizenship. El Zoghbi is the oldest born among two brothers and one sister. El Zoghbi began singing at an early age, despite familial opposition to the lifestyle of a musician. Members of her family changed their minds when they realized she was serious in her ambitions. In 1988 she participated in the Lebanese talent show Studio El Fan. In 1990 she married Lebanese music manager Elie Deeb and went on to have three children with him. The couple legally separated in 2008, and El Zoghbi waited three years for the Maronite Church to recognize their divorce. In late 2009, El Zoghbi was granted custody of her three children and in March 2011, her divorce was officially legalized.
