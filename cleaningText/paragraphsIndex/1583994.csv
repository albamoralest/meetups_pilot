"Sermon started professionally in 1986 as a producer and artist of the hip hop group EPMD. He began recording solo albums for Def Jam in 1993; in 1997, he rejoined EPMD. The following year, Sermon, Murray and Redman recorded a cover version of ""Rapper's Delight"" by the Sugarhill Gang. EPMD disbanded a second time in 1999.

"In 2000, Sermon moved over to J Records, and released the album Music the following year. The album's first single, ""Music"", featured guest vocals from Marvin Gaye, which Sermon reportedly culled from unreleased recordings found in a small record shop in London. ""Music"" went on to become Sermon's highest-charting song, peaking at number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 2 on the R&B chart. Sermon's second album on J Records, React, was released in 2002. React's title track peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, but the album sold poorly and Sermon was dropped from the label in 2003. In a June 30, 2004 interview with HipHopDX.com, Sermon told music journalist Bayer Mack, ""Things weren't right at J Records. Clive Davis and them don't believe in promotion. When Puffy had Bad Boy at Arista, it was him doing all the [promotional] work."" He also stated Busta Rhymes and Wyclef Jean had similar issues with J Records. Sermon went on to establish his Def Squad imprint with Universal Records and released his sixth solo album, Chilltown, New York, in 2004. The album was powered by the single ""Feel It"" (which contained a sample of reggae/R&B singer Sean Paul), a song which became a success in the United States.

Soon after, Sermon has recorded ""Don't Make No Sense"" with Def Squad.
