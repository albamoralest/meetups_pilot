"Tormentor joined Infernus in Gorgoroth in 1996, and participated as guitarist and songwriter on the two Gorgoroth albums Destroyer (1998) and Incipit Satan (2000), both albums released by Nuclear Blast. He toured with Gorgoroth both in Europe and South America. He left the band in 2002 due to no longer being able to cooperate with bassist King ov Hell, but returned for a one-off concert in Bergen, Norway, in 2003. In late 2007, after internal conflicts in Gorgoroth resulted in the departure of King and vocalist Gaahl, Infernus announced that Tormentor would assist him in the pre-production of the next Gorgoroth album, Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt. In September 2008, Tormentor officially rejoined Gorgoroth. In addition to his work with Gorgoroth, in 2002 Tormentor was one of the founding members of Orcustus, together with Taipan, Infernus, and Dirge Rep. After releasing a demo and two 7"" vinyl singles, Orcustus' debut full-length album was released in 2009 by Southern Lord Records.
