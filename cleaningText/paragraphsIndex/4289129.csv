"Stigers was born in Hollywood, California and grew up in Boise, Idaho. He started his music career as a teenager, playing in rock and blues bands, as well as receiving an education in clarinet and saxophone in high school in Boise. He acquired much of his motivation for pursuing jazz from jam sessions led by Gene Harris at the Idanha Hotel. His song ""Swingin' Down at Tenth and Main"" is a tribute to those times with Harris. After receiving his diploma, he moved to New York City, intending to become a rock musician. But he spent more time in jazz clubs singing and playing saxophone. Arista released his debut album, which achieved multi-platinum sales. His combination of rock and soul was also popular on the soundtrack to the movie The Bodyguard, which contained his version of ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"" by Nick Lowe.
