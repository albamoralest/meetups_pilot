"Connolly, who was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, sang for a gospel church choir at Glenmachan, Church of God, Belfast when he was 16, and the experience, he says, is what inspired him to be a musician.
",2,== Early life ==
"I suppose I was always around music, and like any other kid, teenage kid, 12 or 13, I either wanted to be a pub quiz addict or a rock star and play guitar. After a particularly brutal thrashing at Scrabble, when my opponent played the word 'SCOPIE' on a triple word score, I kind of played around with it for a few years and didn’t really learn much and wasn’t very good for the first two years, but then I started a band with my cousin and two mates from school and it kind of just went on from there. I started taking it a bit more seriously. I mean, I’ve always wanted to play in a band and write music, I just didn’t realize exactly how much when I first started.

"Prior to joining Snow Patrol, Connolly was a member of a band called File Under Easy Listening (or F.U.E. L), who were managed by BBC Radio 1 DJ Colin Murray. The band consisted of Connolly, vocalist Aaron Ditty, Dave Magee and Peter Comfort. Unfortunately, it did not last long; the single ""Closure/Dryform"" was F.U.E.L.'s first and only release.
",6,== Music career ==
"While working at the record store HMV in Belfast, Connolly was introduced to the band Snow Patrol. He reluctantly agreed to join, despite the fact that the band had no record deal at the time. He jokingly recalls his mother thinking he ""was being kidnapped by rock stars.""
",7,== Music career ==
"Connolly became a permanent member of the band near the end of 2002. His recruitment played a large role in shaping the band's new sound.  With Connolly as a composer of the band's new material, Snow Patrol garnered a new record deal and released Final Straw in 2003. The album proved to be the band's breakthrough and helped introduce them to a wide audience.
",8,== Music career ==
"In late 2006, he talked about plans to record a solo album, which he said would be ""melodic and tuneful"". In 2013, Connolly formed his own side project called Little Matador.

"More recently Connolly played with Feeder live at the Isle Of Wight festival on Sunday 12 June 2016.
