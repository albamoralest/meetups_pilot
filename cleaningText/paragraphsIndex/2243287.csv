"Molly McGuire is a multi-talented visual artist currently based in New Orleans, LA. Her canvases center around the theme of ""Circus Banners of the Mind."" In 2014, McGuire painted the complete line of circus banners for the 20th Century Fox television series: American Horror Story Freak Show. Working under the moniker “Magwire,” Molly's art is created from re-appropriated canvas drop cloths and custom tinted house paint salvaged from movie sets. The banners tend to reflect contemporary folklore and mythology presented as a carnival advertisement, or circus banner.
