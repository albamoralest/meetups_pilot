"At the age of fourteen Jones picked up playing the acoustic guitar, which he purchased after hearing Axis: Bold as Love. During the early seventies, Jones discovered American primitive guitar and became influenced by Robbie Basho and John Fahey. It wasn't until he was asked by Robin Amos to join Shut-Up that he began playing an electric guitar. In 1989, he founded Cul de Sac with Amos in Boston, Massachusetts.
