"Ron has been hailed as one of the most influential progressive metal guitarists and has been called ""the Godfather of Technical Metal."" He has been cited as an influence by numerous players, particularly from the burgeoning technical death metal scene, most prominently Muhammed Suiçmez of Necrophagist. Ron is also featured in the 2009 book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists by British author Joel McIver who calls Jarzombek ""the most underrated axemonger ever”. Decibel Magazine remarked, ""Ron Jarzombek should be a friggin’ legend by now"" in its review of Blotted Science's The Machinations of Dementia.

"Ron wrote several exclusive pieces for Atlanta, GA-based Morley Arts Productions, a small animation company. These include the intro to a proposed science fiction short film titled Magnatania and bits featured on the Morley Arts 2005 demo reel which starts off with 'See and It's Sharp' by Spastic Ink.  Another unreleased piece utilized was the Vai-esque Martians Marchin', originally meant to be a 'soundtrack for' a lithograph called House of Stairs by M.C. Escher. In 2004, the animated 15-minute space mini-epic Time Ace, produced by Morley Arts and featuring two of Jarzombek's compositions, was awarded 'Best Animation' by a jury of film industry professionals in clickflick.tv's online film festival.

"Jarzombek plays custom-made guitars he builds himself, the reason being that ""I am rather selective when it comes to guitars. For me, it's easier to build a guitar totally from scratch than to buy something off the shelf and customize it. The necks are taken off of guitars that I come across at local music stores."" He tunes his guitars to dropped 7-string tuning (A E A D G B or A E A D G B E).
