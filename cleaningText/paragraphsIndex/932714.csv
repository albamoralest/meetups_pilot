"In 1985, Brickell was invited to sing one night with friends from her high school in a local folk rock group, New Bohemians. She joined the band as lead singer. After the band was signed to a recording contract, the label changed the group's name to Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. Their 1988 debut album, Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars, became a critical and commercial success, including the Top Ten single ""What I Am"". The band's follow-up album, Ghost of a Dog (1990), was a deliberate effort to highlight the band's eclectic personality and move away from the pop sensibility of their first record. The band sporadically played gigs after the album Ghost of a Dog in 1990, and in 2006 released Stranger Things. In 2018 they announced their latest album, Rocket, along with dates for a US tour.
