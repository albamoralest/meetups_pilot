"Born in Moscow and educated at the Gnessin State Musical College (1971–88), she rose to prominence after winning the 1987 Concorso Busoni. This success opened up the Italian halls to her, and as soon as she graduated she embarked on a tour, debuting in the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. She finished with her German debut in Munich and she was immediately contracted by Deutsche Grammophon. She settled in Hamburg two years later, where she still lives with her husband and her two sons, Daniel and Anton. She has since had a successful concert career. She has been teaching at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena since 2011.
