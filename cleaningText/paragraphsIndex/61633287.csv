"Puff first began writing songs in fifth grade. The Left at London project originally started as a band, though after the project fell apart Puff kept the previous group's monicker as her stage name, as she was uncomfortable using her legal name. The name Left at London comes from an experience where Puff misread the sign of a local bar called ""The Loft at Tandem"". She began posting short videos on Vine in 2014. In 2014 and 2015 while still in high school, Puff released three demo EPs, Youth Group Computer, 2 Rowdy 4 Dennys / Give Peace a Break, and Will Write Songs 4 Money, all receiving very limited releases. The EPs were later re-released on Bandcamp on February 5, 2021.
