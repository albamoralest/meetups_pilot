"Jeff Caxide is an American bassist, best known for his time with post-metal band Isis, of which he was a founding member and present until its dissolution in 2010. He was also a founding member of Red Sparowes, but left after the release of their first full-length.  He also contributed to side-project Spylacopa. Prior to his time in Isis, he was a touring member of the Boston metalcore band 454 Big Block. He also helped found Connecticut-based metalcore band Cable, for whom he played bass. His stay with the band as a musician was brief, but he did return in order to produce 1999's Gutter Queen. After Isis' dissolution, Caxide went on to create Endless Midnight, an ambient solo album, under the moniker Crone. Mixed by former Isis bandmate Aaron Harris, it was released in 2011 by Waylon Recordings. Brooklyn Vegan made a track, ""The Silver Hammer"", available for streaming on June 28, 2011 and Noisecreep premiered ""What You Dream Of"" on July 18. In April 2012 it was announced that Caxide had joined Chino Moreno of Deftones, along with former bandmates Aaron Harris and Clifford Meyer, in a band by the name of Palms. Their self-titled debut album was released in June 2013. He lists Pink Floyd, Swans, The Cure and Mogwai as influences. He plays Music Man Stingray and Sage basses.
