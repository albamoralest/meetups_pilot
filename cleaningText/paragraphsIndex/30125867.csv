"Oda gained prominence as a songwriter in Japan during the late 1980s. He composed over 50 top-ten hit singles on the Japanese Oricon chart during the 1990s, including 12 that have sold over 1 million copies. At the commercial peak of his career, Oda produced a string of popular hit songs with artists such as Zard, Wands, Deen, and Field of View. He also discovered and collaborated with Nanase Aikawa, one of the best-selling Japanese female pop icons from the latter half of the 1990s.

"Oda has embarked on his own solo career since the 1980s, achieving mainstream success with the help of contributions from other artists. As a recording artist, he is best known for the chart-topping single ""Itsumademo Kawaranu Ai o"", which was released in 1992. In 1990, Oda won the 32nd Japan Record Award for the song ""Odoru Pompokorin"", co-written by Momoko Sakura and performed by B.B. Queens. Oda has been the third best-selling composer in the history of the Japanese singles chart, which started in 1968, just behind Kyohei Tsutsumi and Tetsuya Komuro. Accumulated sales of his compositions released as singles have been estimated at over 40 million units as of 2008.

"In 2000, he was attacked in an attempted robbery in Madrid, Spain, where he was visiting for sight seeing. His neck was squeezed from behind so hard that his vocal cords were damaged and his singing voice disappeared. After a year of rehabilitation, Oda resumed a live tour in 2002.
