"Riedel was born in Schwerin on 11 April 1971. Growing up, he had relatively good relationships with both of his parents. He attributes this to the small gap between their ages. As a child, he was not a good student, but he made his way through school with the assistance of his mother. Riedel was quite shy, especially during his teenage years; while his friends partied, he would often be found just ""hanging around"".

"In 1990, at the age of 19, Riedel began playing in a folk/punk band called the Inchtabokatables. In 1994, Riedel, Till Lindemann, Richard Kruspe, and Christoph Schneider entered and won the Berlin Senate Metro beat contest that allowed them to record a four-track demo professionally. Paul Landers and Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz would later join the band they named Rammstein.

"The six released their first album, Herzeleid (""Heartache""), in September 1995. Their second album, Sehnsucht (""Desire""), was released in 1997, which would later become platinum. In April 2001, the album Mutter (""Mother"") was released and a European tour followed, ending on 13 July 2002. It has been reported that at this time the members of Rammstein were seriously discussing whether to continue or not in their present form. It was decided that they should all take some time off and then reconsider whether to continue. In 2003, Rammstein started to work on their fourth album, which turned out to be a turning point in the band's sound and maturity. In September 2004, the band saw their work pay off with the release of Reise, Reise (""rise, rise"").
