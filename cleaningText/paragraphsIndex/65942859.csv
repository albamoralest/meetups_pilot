"Sam Teskey was born in 1989 at his parents home in Warrandyte, Victoria, in the room above what is now their studio. He attended a local primary school with no year levels. He was close to his brother Josh, with Josh saying in 2021, ""We had these bird calls we'd do so we could always find each other in bush near where we lived. We also used them at parties when we were teenagers. I'd do the call and Sam would materialise out of the crowd."" The two started playing music together after moving to a Steiner high school when Josh was 15 and Sam 13. Josh said ""I jumped straight into singing and then played guitar, but Sam focused on the guitar"".
