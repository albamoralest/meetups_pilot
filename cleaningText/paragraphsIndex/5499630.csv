"Phillips got her start in a music career when she graduated from Belmont University in 1998. Her first, self-titled album was produced by Grammy-award winning Wayne Kirkpatrick who has produced for such artists as Amy Grant, Garth Brooks, and Susan Ashton. Kirkpatrick said that it was ""the honesty of her [Phillips'] songs, the charm of her voice, and the strength of her character that drew me to her as an artist – I knew that being involved with someone like that would be time well spent.""  Following the release of first album, Phillips toured with Caedmon's Call and Bebo Norman.
