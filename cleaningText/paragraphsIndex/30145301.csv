"Katherine Hoover (December 2, 1937 – September 21, 2018) is remembered by the National Flute Association as an ""artist—flutist, teacher, entrepreneur, poet, and, most notably, a distinguished composer"". Her work received many honors, including a National Endowment Composer's Fellowship, an Academy of Arts and Letters Award in composition, the National Flute Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. Her career as a composer began at a time when few women composers earned recognition in classical music in the 1970s. As shown in her list of known work, below, she has composed pieces for solo flute, mixed ensembles, chamber orchestra, choir acapella, full orchestra and many other combinations of instruments and voice. Some of her flute pieces incorporated Native American themes.

"Hoover was born in Elkins, West Virginia, on December 2, 1937. Her mother was a painter/artist and editor, and her father was a biochemist. Her family lived in Washington, D.C., then moved to Philadelphia during World War II. She attended school in Philadelphia. She remembered hearing Mozart's music on a record player when she was three years old. She also recalled reading music as early as four years old, before she could read words. Her parents supported her artistic interests, rescuing a piano being disposed of by a neighbor and starting her at piano lessons at five years old. She began flute lessons at age eight. During this time, she discovered that she had perfect-pitch. During interviews, she has shared she received ""mediocre music instruction"" during her early years. Hoover began her academic studies at the University of Rochester in 1955. After two years of general studies she was accepted to Eastman School of Music, where she studied with flutist Joseph Mariano, and began studying composition. She graduated with a Bachelor of Music in Music Theory and a Performer's Certificate in Flute in 1959. Unfortunately, her composition classes left a bad impression. Hoover comments, ""There were no women involved with composition at all. [I got] rather discouraged – being the only woman in my classes, not being paid attention to and so forth.""Hoover attended the Yale Summer Sessions in 1960 and 1961, where she studied flute, theory, and composition. During this time, she also studied with flutist William Kincaid in Philadelphia.

She was asked to compose a piece for a school concert, a duet for violins, which was very well received. She married John Schwab in 1964. They divorced after eight years.

"In 1969, Hoover began teaching flute and theory at the Manhattan School of Music. She shared that, as a theory teacher she learned a great deal about compositional techniques, as it forced her to carefully analyze a wide spectrum of music scores. Also, during this time at Manhattan, she continued her graduate studies and received her Master of Music in Music Theory in 1974. It was also where she studied how other people identify with sounds.  She was a faculty member of Manhattan School of Music for seventeen years. The first publication of her work was Three Carols (1972) for choir and flute, published by Carl Fischer.

"Hoover co-founded Papagena Press, with her husband (Richard Goodwin, m.1985 ) in 1988 to publish her works. The first piece to be published was Kokopeli (1990), a work for solo flute inspired by the Hopi tribe and the American Southwest. It won the National Flute Association's Newly Published Music Competition (1991). This was Hoover's second of six NFA Newly Published Music awards. A list of her known works is listed chronologically below. Many predate Papagena Press. As her career spans many forms of media, LP to Cassette to CD to digital, and at-least two generations of copyright, her lists of works might appear disjointed.
