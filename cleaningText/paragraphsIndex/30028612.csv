"Besides his progressive rock ventures, Nolan has written a rock-opera, She based upon the novel by Sir H Rider Haggard. In 2008, it was filmed for DVD in Katowice, Poland. In 2010, the show was again performed in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Since then Nolan has started the Caamora Theatre Company, and turned She into a full musical, which was performed for the first time at The Playhouse in Cheltenham in 2012. Nolan's musical Alchemy finished its run at the Jermyn Street Theatre in the West End of London in August 2014. The libretto is based on the composer's original story. He created a sequel entitled King's Ransom in 2017. Both musicals have now taken the first step towards becoming full theatrical-release feature films.
