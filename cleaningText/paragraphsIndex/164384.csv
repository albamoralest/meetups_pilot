"McClintock was born on October 8, 1884, in Uhrichsville, Ohio, ""the son of a railroad cabinet maker and nephew of four boomer trainmen"". He was the son of Walter McClintock (1852-1901) and Joanna Kirby (1852-after 1920) and only had a single sibling, Milton McClintock (1876-1880). His family was native to Tippecanoe, Ohio, and soon after his birth his parents removed their small family to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they raised him. His drifting began when he ran away from home as a boy to join a circus. He railroaded in Africa; worked as a seaman; saw action in the Philippines as a civilian mule-train packer, supplying American troops with food and ammunition; and in 1899 found himself in China as an aide to newsmen covering the Boxer Rebellion. Back in the States, he hired out to the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway in the Pittsburgh area, and from there he took the boomer trail as railroader and a minstrel. ""Mac lived an adventurous life and never lost his sense of humor"". Harry McClintock married Bessie Johnson on September 8, 1917, in Farmington City, Utah. They only ever had one daughter, Joan (McClintock) Norman.

"The writer Jim Thompson, an acquaintance of McClintock, alluded to McClintock in his autobiographical work Big Boy. Thompson stated that he ""was put next to a job"" dismantling oil derricks ""by a character named Strawlegs, a one-time banjo player and an all-time dipsomaniac"". Later on, he says, ""Strawlegs was a very good banjo player, as, if you have guessed his right name, you know. He was also a very good little guy.""
