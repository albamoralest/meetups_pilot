"Jimmy Ray Johnson (February 4, 1943 â€“ September 5, 2019) was an American session guitarist and record producer. Johnson was a member of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section who was attached to FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, for a period in the 1960s. In 1969, with the backing of Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler, Johnson became a co-founder of the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, along with drummer Roger Hawkins, bassist David Hood, and keyboardist Barry Beckett. The studio was originally located at 3614 Jackson Highway in Sheffield and later moved to 1000 Alabama Avenue, also in Sheffield. Johnson performed with Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin. He also engineered three tracks on the Rolling Stones' album Sticky Fingers. He died from kidney failure in 2019 at the age of 76.
