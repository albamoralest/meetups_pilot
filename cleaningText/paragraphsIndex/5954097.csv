He started learning the pipes from John Potts of Wexford and William Andrews, then with the renowned piper Leo Rowsome. Breathnach started work as a civil servant with the Department of Agriculture, but in 1965 switched to the Department of Education where he was responsible for collecting music from around Ireland.
