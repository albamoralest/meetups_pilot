",1,== Career ==
"Baker made his debut as a singer on Magnet Records/Epic Records in the United Kingdom. In 1975, he released his first solo album, Into a Dream (MAG 5009). From that album, he had one hit with ""Sherry"" a cover of the Four Seasons hit on the UK Singles Chart reaching No. 10 in July 1975, and performed several times on the BBC Television's Top of the Pops programme. As a record producer, Baker is known across Europe for his dance hit productions with the group Liquid Gold. He twice attempted to write the UK's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, reaching the A Song For Europe final in both 1979 and 1981. His first finalist song, ""Miss Caroline Newley"", performed by the band M Squad finished eleventh of the twelve songs in 1979. But in 1981, his song ""Don't Panic"", performed by Liquid Gold, finished in second place and had the rare distinction of being a losing song from the A Song For Europe contest to make the UK Singles Chart, reaching #42.

"Baker, with his band Gidea Park, recorded a version of the Beach Boys ""California Girls"" for the James Bond film, A View to a Kill. It was featured in the opening sequence with Bond snowboarding. It has been suggested that this teaser sequence helped initiate interest in snowboarding. In the United States, he is best known for being the falsetto voice for the touring Beach Boys band from 1981 to 1982, 1990 to 1993, and 1998 to 2004. Baker was also a member of The Four Seasons with Frankie Valli from 1994 to 1995. In 2006, Baker released his sixth solo album, Runaway Tracks.

"On 19 March 2011, Baker was presented with the Key to the City of Hickory, North Carolina, for his efforts raising money for education.  Baker was Honorary Chairman of the Hickory Rotary Club's Rotarian Idol Education Scholarship competition for the second consecutive year. He is currently touring with the band Papa Doo Run Run.
