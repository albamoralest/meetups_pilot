Cain aided Journey's rise to the top of the charts with his first collaborations on the album Escape, composing and playing the piano on songs such as ""Don't Stop Believin'"", described by AllMusic as ""one of the best opening keyboard riffs in rock"". Perhaps his most notable contribution was as sole author of the Journey ballad ""Faithfully"", a song about life on the road while in a band. Cain would go on to appear on at least 13 other Journey albums and compilations.
