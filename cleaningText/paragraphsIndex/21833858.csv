"Fay-Ann was born in Point Fortin, Trinidad to parents Austin Lyons (sobriquet Superblue/SuperBlue, formerly known as Blueboy) and Lynette Steele (sobriquet Lady Gypsy), who is also a sister to Winston ""Gypsy"" Peters, hence the gypsy part of her stage name.
",2,== Early life and career ==
"Fay-Ann Lyons is a three-time Trinidad and Tobago Carnival Road March champion (2003, 2008, 2009) and the 2009 International Soca Monarch and International Groovy Soca Monarch champion. She created history (again) when she won the International Soca Monarch for the first time in 2009, as the first female to win the Power category, and the first individual (male or female) to win the Power, Groovy and People's Choice awards on Fantastic Friday (aka Carnival Friday) during the finals of the competition which is held annually in Trinidad. She also went on to win the Carnival Road March that year, becoming the first soca artist to win that soca 'triplet' of titles. She is the first (and only) woman to accomplish that feat while pregnant. Fay-Ann is the youngest solo artist (male or female), still actively recording, with multiple wins of the Carnival Road March crown. (Machel Montano is the youngest male with multiple wins, now that he has four solo wins and a joint win with Patrice Roberts). Fay-Ann remains the only female artist who has won the Carnival Road March three times, and is the third to attain back-to-back wins in two consecutive years joining fellow Trinidadian Macartha Calypso Rose Lewis and Alison Hinds of Barbados. Fay-Ann and husband Bunji Garlin also became parents in 2009 to a daughter born on February 28, 2009, just a few weeks after Carnival. Fay-Ann has performed at musical events both locally and abroad. Her on-tour performance events and locations include: Washington DC (2009) & (2017) BET's 106 & Park (2014), Coachella (2015), Glastonbury Festival (2015), London's Coronet (2015), Berlin Carnival-Germany and, BET X Live (2018). She is officially the new record holder for the most up-tempoes ever released by a female Soca musician with 28 up-tempo soca songs surpassing the previous record of 25 set by Alison Hinds. In 2003 she won Carnival Road March with ""Display"" and 5 years later she won it again in 2008 with "" Get On ""  and because both of those songs were uptempo she became the  second female soca artiste in the English Caribbean to win a Road March title with an uptempo soca song and the first to do so since Alison Hinds Won it in Barbados in 1996 with ""Raggamuffiin"". ref>""Bunji, Fay Ann, Shenseea to perform on BET"". www.looptt.com.
