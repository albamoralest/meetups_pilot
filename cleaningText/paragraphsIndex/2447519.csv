"Jesse Malin began his music career, at the age of 12, as the front-man for the seminal New York City hardcore band Heart Attack.  The band auditioned at CBGBs but were denied because they couldn't bring in a drinking crowd to the bar. Following the demise of Heart Attack in 1984, Jesse worked on several other projects, including the band Hope, before joining the band D Generation for which he was the lead singer. As one of New York City's most noted bands of the 1990s, D Generation released three albums, including the critically acclaimed No Lunch, before eventually disbanding in April 1999. The band reunited and released it fourth album, Nothing Is Anywhere, in 2016.

"Malin didn't stop writing music and went on to form two other projects, PCP Highway (with former D Generation bandmates Howie Pyro and Joe Rizzo) and Bellvue (also named Tsing-Tsing for a brief time); the latter band released one album, To Be Somebody, on Goldenseal Records. The album included versions of songs that would later be reworked for Malin's first two solo albums, including ""Solitaire"", ""Basement Home"", ""Brooklyn"" and ""Downliner"".

"Being a fan of Neil Young, Tom Waits, and Steve Earle affected his work; Malin spent the next two years working on a fresh sound. Former Whiskeytown front-man Ryan Adams, who'd been a friend of Malin since the D Generation days, was impressed with Malin's new material. Adams offered to produce Malin's debut album despite the fact that he'd never produced a record before. The two headed into Loho Studios in New York in January 2001 and made an album in just six days. A deal with Artemis Records soon followed. The Fine Art of Self Destruction appeared in the United Kingdom in October 2002. The lead off first single, ""Queen of the Underworld"" was a moderate hit and the British press quickly hailed Malin's debut as one of the year's best.
