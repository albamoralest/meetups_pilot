"Tavárez was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the son of a French father and a Puerto Rican mother. San Juan was the city where he first began his musical studies. His first musical mentors were José Cabrizas and Domingo Delgado. Tavárez was a student of Gonzalo de J. Núñez (1850 – 1915), whose students also included the internationally known musicians and composers Juan Morel Campos and Arístides Chavier Arévalo. Tavárez became an accomplished pianist at an early age. He was able to enroll and study music in the Music Conservatory of Paris at the age of 15 with a scholarship granted by ""The Economic Society of Friends of Puerto Rico"" (La Sociedad Económica Amigos del Pais).  Tavárez studied under the guidance of Auber and D'Albert. While in France, Tavárez suffered a stroke which left his hand partially paralyzed. Tavárez returned to Puerto Rico because of his health problems. He settled down in Ponce where he gave piano lessons.  He was able to overcome his health problems and began to put on musical concerts of his compositions.

Among his best known works was the funeral march Redención (Redemption), dedicated to the memory of José Campeche; the rhapsody Souvenir de Puerto Rico, and his danzas Recuerdos de Antaño (Remembrance of Yesteryear) and what is considered his greatest work, the danza Margarita.
