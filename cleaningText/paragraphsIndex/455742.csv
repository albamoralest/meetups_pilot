"In recent years, he had teamed up with fellow salsa singer Ismael Miranda to produce some boleros and bohemian music.  By 2005-06 he began creating a new blend between salsa and reggaeton, called salsaton. In April 2006, he released a new album titled Salsatón - Salsa con Reggaetón, which was produced by Sergio George and featured reggaeton rappers Daddy Yankee, Julio Voltio, La Sista, and John Eric. In 2007, he filmed various television advertisements on nutrition for the Puerto Rico Department of Family Affairs (including one in which he sang a rhumba to a dancing carrot).

"On November 2, 2006, Montañez won his first Latin Grammy for Best Traditional Tropical Album, together with Pablo Milanés. Montañez was selected to form part of a benefit concert titled “Somos Haití”, where funds would be gathered to support Haiti after the 2008 hurricane season. In 2015, Montañez appeared on Puerto Rican singer Ivy Queen's ninth studio album Vendetta. The album was split into four separate albums, one being an album composed entirely of only salsa music. On the album, Montañez dueted with Queen on a re-recording of his 1988 hit, ""Casi Te Envidio"".
