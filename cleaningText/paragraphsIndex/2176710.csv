"After giving his demos to Prince in a bid to join Prince's Paisley Park, he recorded his own track ""Sexappeal"" (sometimes ""Sex Appeal"") on his own Georgio Records. ""A lot of people in Los Angeles just gave me the run- around and didn't want to make a commitment."" Allentini stated. In 1984, Motown Records showed interest in Allentini and he was eventually signed to the label. Said Motown's then-vice-president of A&R Russ Regan ""I heard Sexappeal for myself on my car radio one day and felt it was a record Motown had to go after, but I wanted to meet the artist first. I didn't want to buy just a record. We had dinner and I got excited. There was just something about him.""In 1987, Allentini had several songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100, although none climbed any higher than number 58. He was much more successful on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart, where he earned four Top 10 hits, including ""Tina Cherry"" which went to number  1. His 1988 release, ""Lover's Lane"" reached number 54 in the UK Singles Chart. Allentini recorded two albums on Motown Records in the 1980s and one on RCA Records in the 1990s. He also worked at MIG Records.
