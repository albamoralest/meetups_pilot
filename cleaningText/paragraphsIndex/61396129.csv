"Rophnan was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He is the ninth child out of 10 children in his family. His father named him Rophnan after having a revelation during deep prayer, the name Rophnan is not in Amharic nor does it have roots in any other language. When he was 10 years old, Rophnan started recording tapes in his classroom, singing and improvising drums to entertain his friends. His music style uniquely merges traditional Ethiopian instruments with contemporary electronic music.

The Mahmoud Ahmed's remix of the legendary song ""Bemin Sebeb Litash"" gained the most attention. The remix showcased Rophnan's ability to translate traditional melodies and rhymes into powerful electronic anthems.

"In the following years, Rophnan slowly established himself as the country's biggest DJ while introducing the country to electronic music. He had residencies in all the top clubs in Addis Ababa, often playing 3 shows a night. Rophnan kept his own music unreleased and made sure that the only place one could hear his tracks would be when he played them himself. One of Rophnan signature tracks, ""Get To Work"", a Gurage-based beat, was released this way and was played exclusively as part of Rophnan's own DJ sets, which made the song famous within Addis Ababa youth without having to release it.  Rophnan played a pivotal role in the rise of electronic music and DJ culture in Ethiopia. He continued to headline more and more events packing the biggest venues.
