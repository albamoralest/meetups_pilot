"Elle describes her career as Patwa as a time when she was making music for the intent of acquiring commercial success. As she grew older her desire to shed light on topics of importance grew also. It was her belief that females were losing their power and self-worth in a male-dominated society. In an effort to promote higher consciousness and self-esteem among women, Patwa changed her name to Elle Royal and her focus to inspire and empower females. In 2015 she signed and collaborated with female singers, rappers, models and dancers under a new label she founded. She then changed her name to Elle Royal to reflect her new purpose of empowering women. As she explains, “Elle” comes from her first name, Danielle and “Royal” comes from “having the status of a King or Queen”.
