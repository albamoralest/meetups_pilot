"Star Slinger curates an international club night under the name Jet Jam along with visual artists Anze Sekelj & Michaela Selmani. The night's programming puts an emphasis on eclecticism and no emphasis on BPM.  Artists to have played the party include Bondax, Shlohmo & Baths (musician). The JET JAM logo was designed by Michaela Selmani. In November 2012, Jet Jam released its first single in the form of Star Slinger ""Ladies In The Back"" (Feat. Teki Latex) on 12"" vinyl & digital download formats. They have signed many new artists since then and rolled out Toronto-based act Harrison's ""Colors"" EP in Europe in collaboration with Toronto's Last Gang Records.
