"When commenting on how file sharing has devalued music, Stone commented: “Music for a generation has become disposable and it used to be a collectible.”  Not to mince words, Stone targeted Napster when he said “It is the single most insidious website I’ve ever seen…it’s like a burglar’s tool”In a Los Angeles Times article on Net Music, Stone was asked to comment on what price consumers would be willing to pay for downloaded music:  ""Forty-nine cents seems like the appropriate amount,"" said Ron Stone, president of Gold Mountain Entertainment, an artist management firm.  ""if you can get kids to spend 49 cents, consider it a gift.  Make it 99 cents, you won't sell any, particularly if the singles market is a kids market."" Stone continued to criticize his own industry as well as the Internet when he said “Were kind of stuck in this plantation system with the record companies.  And they’re the only games in town.  And we looked at the Internet as an opportunity to extricate ourselves from this situation and deal directly with our audience.  And now it’s not an option because the option now is we can have the relatively bad contractual arrangement with one of the majors, or we could have our property taken for free.  These are very bad choices.”
