"Greg Roberts (born 29 May 1958) is a British rock drummer. He was part of Big Audio Dynamite from 1984 to 1989. He went on to form Screaming Target in 1991 with ex-Big Audio Dynamite members Don Letts and Leo 'E-Zee Kill' Williams, then started Dreadzone with Tim Bran, Williams and Dan Donovan, another former Big Audio Dynamite member. Dreadzone had a no. 20 hit in the UK Singles Chart with ""Little Britain"" in 1996. A self-taught musician, Roberts has said that his experience with Big Audio Dynamite – particularly the band's use of technology (including a drum machine) – enabled him to become a writer and arranger, and also led to him forming Dreadzone. Roberts has also worked as a session musician.
