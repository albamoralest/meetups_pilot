"Smith first appeared on Decca Records in 1960 with a rockabilly backbeat song, ""Sara Ruth"" which was written as a joke for a high school friend.

In 1962, Smith had a release on Era Records of ""By the Time You Read This Letter"" b/w ""That's What I'd Do"", which were recorded in the Gold Star Studios of Hollywood, the inventors of flanging and phasing.
