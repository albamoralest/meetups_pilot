"Autexier was passionate about music, his research led him to become a musicologist and music historian, a speaker who expressed in French, English, German and Italian. He has taught at several conservatories and universities in France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States. He has written music reviews for various specialised journals, and a number of books on Mozart, Liszt, Bartók and other Freemason musicians. He was director of the “Mozart et franc maçon” (Mozart and Freemason) exhibition in 1991 in Cahors. He has also participated in many radio programmes, such as France Musique, France Culture, BBC Radio, as well as German and Swiss channels. During more than 20 years, he worked on the subject of “Colonne d’Harmonie” (Column of Harmony)—a research on the Masonic music history—which led him to study all the collections of Masonic archives in Europe (Paris, Strasbourg, Zürich, Vienna, Bayreuth, Berlin, Poznań, The Hague, et cetera). The research results have been published in his book La Colonne d’Harmonie : Histoire, Théorie, Pratique. Among Autexier's publications, the only work for general public is Beethoven : La force de l’absolu, a richly illustrated pocket book belonging to the “Découvertes Gallimard” collection, which has been translated into seven languages, including English. It is simple, concise and accessible to all, unlike the rest of his books which are elitist works.
