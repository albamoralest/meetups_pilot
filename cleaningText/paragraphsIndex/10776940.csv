"At the age of 15, Livingstone moved to the United Kingdom. Livingstone's first record was released without his knowledge: A tenant in the building where he and a friend jammed recorded some of these sessions released some tracks on the Planetone record label. When London-based Carnival Records was seeking a Jamaican vocal duo, Livingstone filled the requirement by double-tracking his own voice, releasing records in this fashion under the name Sugar & Dandy. One of these singles, ""What a Life"", sold 25,000 copies, providing Livingstone with his first hit. When called on to perform live, Roy Smith was recruited to make up the duo, although he would be replaced by Tito ""Sugar"" Simon. In 1967, Livingstone signed with Ska Beat Records, for whom he recorded his debut album 1967's Rocksteady with Dandy.

"In 1968, Livingstone moved into production, and formed a duo with Audrey Hall (as Dandy & Audrey). His production of other artists included The Marvels' debut album and hit singles by Nicky Thomas (""Suzanne Beware of The Devil"") and Tony Tribe (""Red Red Wine""). In the late 1960s, Livingstone worked with the trombonist Rico Rodriguez, who was featured on ""Rudy, A Message to You"". Rodriguez later played with The Specials, whose 1979 cover version of the song made it famous. Livingstone produced several singles for Rodriguez under the name Rico & the Rudies.
",3,== Biography ==
"Livingstone signed to Trojan Records in 1968, releasing two albums, Follow That Donkey and Dandy Returns. A Trojan subsidiary, Down Town Records, was set up to release Livingstone's output, both as a singer and producer, and the J-Dan subsidiary served the same purpose in the early 1970s. Livingstone returned to Jamaica, living there until 1973.
",4,== Biography ==
"Livingstone resurfaced in 1973 with the single ""Black Star"" on Mooncrest Records and the album Conscious. On his return to the UK, he recorded a self-titled album at Byron Lee's studio. It was announced on 11 September 2011 that Livingstone would be performing for the first time in over 40 years at the 2012 London International Ska Festival on 3â€“6 May. Though it was announced on stage that he had been present at the sound check, he did not perform.
