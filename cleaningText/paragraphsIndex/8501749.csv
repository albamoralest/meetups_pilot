"Reddick's biggest project outside of Bowling for Soup is song writing and appearing as the lead singer of the fictional band Love Händel on the television show Phineas and Ferb. It started with Bowling for Soup providing the series' theme song ""Today is Gonna Be a Great Day,"" (nominated for Outstanding Original Main Title Theme Music Emmy in 2008) and later Reddick's character Danny was introduced in the episode ""Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together"". Reddick has since written several songs for the show and made a handful of appearances, both as Danny from Love Händel, and once with cartoon versions of the other members of Bowling for Soup performing ""Today is Gonna Be a Great Day.""

"In 2008, Reddick produced, co-wrote, and co-arranged two singles with solo artist Christy Darlington. SUV & Girls + Summer = Fun! were subsequently recorded at Valve Studios with Reddick producing. Reddick also sung backing vocals and performed guitar parts on the songs, with Christy performing lead vocal parts and guitar parts as well. Erik Chandler performed the bass parts and also backing vocals, and Gary Wiseman performed the drum parts. These two singles would later be released digitally. This collaboration was a result of Reddick & Bowling for Soup having known Darlington & performed concerts together in Dallas in the late 1990s, and a mutual liking and respect for each other's music.
