"Hamish Imlach (10 February 1940 – 1 January 1996) was a Scottish folk singer. Imlach was born in Calcutta to Scottish parents, although he claimed to have been conceived in Glasgow, Scotland. His commercial success was limited, but he influenced many other artists, including most notably John Martyn, Billy Connolly, and Christy Moore. In Central and Northern Europe Imlach enjoyed a strong reputation as a vivid live artist.

"He had his biggest hit in the late 1960s with ""Cod Liver Oil and the Orange Juice"", a scurrilous and hilarious take on the American gospel standard ""Virgin Mary Had a Little Baby"" written by Ron Clark and Carl MacDougall. The song was, for a time banned, by the BBC as it was assumed to be full of double meanings, but at one point became the most requested song on British Forces Radio.

After recovering from a serious illness in the 1970s he regularly toured with Iain MacKintosh as well as doing solo tours. For the last 18 months of his professional life, his stage partner was Kate Kramer, a Canadian fiddle player and singer who lived in Scotland, with whom he recorded his last CD, More and Merrier (1996).
