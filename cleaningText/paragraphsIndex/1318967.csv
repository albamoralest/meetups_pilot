"Among several professions, Getty is a classical music composer whose compositions include the opera Plump Jack, Joan and the Bells, piano pieces, and a collection of choral works. His one-act opera Usher House was performed by the San Francisco Opera in 2015.  Aspiring to become an opera singer, Getty studied in the mid-1970s with Louise Caselotti, a mezzo-soprano who had been Maria Callas' voice teacher (1946–47). He and his wife have supported the fine arts, especially underwriting productions of the San Francisco Opera and the Russian National Orchestra. Getty's opera The Canterville Ghost was premiered on May 9, 2015, at the Leipzig Opera.

"On Christmas Day, 1964, he married Ann Gilbert (1941–2020) in Las Vegas, Nevada. On April 1, 2015, it was reported that Getty's son Andrew Rork Getty died at his home in Hollywood Hills of what was initially classified as natural causes, although coroner's officials needed to wait for the results of further examination and toxicology tests before making a final determination. The coroner eventually ruled the death as accidental. Three of Getty's seven children, Alexandra, Nicolette, and Kendalle, were with Getty's then-mistress Cynthia Beck.
