"His early experience in drumming came from his father, who is also a drummer. Harris would play along to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and The Police, and has reached his current level of proficiency without any lessons or formal training. Melvins and Neurosis are also direct influences on his and Isis' sound. He cites Bill Bruford as an influence on his later material, having been introduced to his work through Danny Carey. Harris' first band was named Loga, which he joined whilst in high school. He was given a cassette of Melvins by the band members and asked to emulate the style of their drummer, Dale Crover. His material, he says, “changed [Harris'] life [...] it really shaped me into a whole new drummer.”In October 2006 Harris began endorsing Paiste cymbals. In 2009, Harris also signed an endorsement deal with Sonor drums. He is also sponsored by Evans Drumheads and Vater. Harris is endorsed by Vater drumsticks, and Heil microphones.
