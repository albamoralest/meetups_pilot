"Linus Eklöw was raised in Stockholm, Sweden. His early musical influences included a range of styles: from Stevie Wonder, classical composer Edvard Grieg, soul music, and jazz; electronic musicians Yello and Kraftwerk; to drum & bass producers DJ Hype, DJ Zinc, Photek, and Roni Size.

"Eklöw started his house music career in 2003, when he released tracks on Derrick Carter's Chicago label, Classic. During these early years, Linus made ""Chicago Jackin'"" House music with ""Swedish refinement and high energy flair,"" and performed at various underground shows in Chicago. In 2007, John Dahlbäck signed Linus’ single ""H-Bomb"" to his Pickadoll label, that was the beginning for a run of releases that in 2008 would see the release of Style of Eye's debut full-length ""Duck, Cover And Hold,"" in addition to its first single: “Girls”. The album contained 13 tracks that spanned such genres as: Minimal House to nu-trance, all geared towards the dance floor and eventually won the P3-Guld and The Manifest Prize for Best Dance Recording in 2009. 2008 was also the year that Claude VonStroke and his Dirtybird imprint released Linus' The Big Kazoo EP (a first Beatport 10 entry for Eklöw), which was followed up the next year by The Race EP.
