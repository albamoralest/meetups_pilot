"He frequently collaborated with American composers and his music was recorded by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, and others. Many of his compositions have also been used in Woody Allen films. When singing songs like ""Alone at a Table for Two"" he would allow his voice to tremble, and seem nearly to break into tears- he was caricatured in Warner Brothers cartoons as ""Cryman"" Lombardo.

"In the late 1960s, actor-raconteur Tony Randall made several TV appearances on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in which he sang songs written by Carmen Lombardo in a voice imitating (and somewhat exaggerating) Lombardo's style. On one appearance, Lombardo and Randall performed a duet of Lombardo's ""Boo Hoo (You've Got Me Crying for You)"", which was one of the songs that Randall typically included in his Lombardo routine.
