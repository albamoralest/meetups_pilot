"The band started with a college graduation and an economic recession. During a slow post-graduation job hunt, Melissa Menago (vocals/guitar) and Chris Kissel (guitar) picked up on where they left off with a college music project. On a whim, they turned to Craigslist for a drummer, not expecting to find Keith Gill, who had been searching the Philadelphia area for a band, and who lived near them. They released their first EP, The Other Side of You in February 2011. Their college peer, Lenny Sasso, stepped in as manager and also became their bass player. They released their first album, Backbone, in 2012.

"The release of Backbone played a significant part in the band's successful tour. Thanks to the combination of the Vans Warped Tour, independent national tours, and local shows, the album's sales have enabled the band to function independently.
