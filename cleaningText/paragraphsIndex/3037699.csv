They would meet again in 2007, when Gorgeous Frankenstein played their first tour, opening for Danzig. This line up included Argyle Goolsby of Blitzkid, Dr. Chud and Gorgeous George. Doyle has since joined them on several occasions to play 30-minute-long sets of classic Misfits songs. During the latter quarter of 2011, former vocalist Danzig and guitarist Doyle performed Misfits songs on four occasions as part of the ""Danzig Legacy"" tour. The first of the four shows, which took place on October 7 in Chicago as one of the headlining acts at Riot Fest, saw a sold-out crowd of 5,000+.

"The album was independently produced and released by Doyle's own Monsterman Records. The official CD release was in October 2013 in major retailers such as Best Buy and FYE. There is an ""advance copy"" that was sold at shows on the Danzig ""Legacy Tour"", as well as from Doyle's official website. This pre-released advance is lacking a 13th track, released on the final cut, entitled ""Drawing Down The Moon"". In May 2014, Doyle announced he was teaming up with Alan Robert, bassist of Life of Agony, for a special Halloween 2014 issue of Robert's award-winning Killogy comic series. Robert said that this was a continuation of his original Killogy comic series but issue will surround Doyle's character. The issue will be published by IDW Publishing. Doyle set out on the 2015 ""Abominator Tour"" in March, hitting the road as an opening act for Mushroomhead through April, with headlining dates continuing after into May. Dr. Chud left the band shortly before the band's first tour ""Annihilate America"" in 2014, and was replaced by Anthony ""Tiny"" Biuso midway through the 2015 tour. Shortly after, ""Tiny"" stated that he would no longer be playing with the band and would not continue on the remainder of the tour. A replacement was found immediately: Brandon Pertzborn, the latest tour drummer of Black Flag.

"Doyle's guitar playing style consists heavily of down strokes and power chords. He admits to limited facility on guitar, believing ""great songs"" are more important than instrumental skill in achieving professional success. Early on in Doyle's career, he used an Ibanez Iceman guitar. However, after experimenting with guitars in Kryst the Conqueror, Doyle developed his custom-made ""Annihilator"" guitar using his experience as a machinist to design and build the guitar himself. These guitars have neck-through design with a graphite body and are loaded with a Seymour Duncan Invader pickup, and are strung with Dean Markley strings. The guitar was made without external screws on the body, as guitars with external screws scratched and cut his skin when he played shirtless. In the 2000s, Doyle collaborated with October Guitars (now spelled ""Oktober"") to recreate the ""Annihilator"" with a signature pickup. Despite this, Doyle still uses his own Annihilator because Oktober were not able to make them the exact way that he wanted.  
",21,== Playing style and equipment ==
"Since the mid-1990s he has used a Demeter TGP-3 rack preamp that feeds an Ampeg SVT bass head. His speaker cabinets are his own design, and have Celestion speakers. His pedalboard has a TC Electronic Chorus/Flanger, an MXR Micro Flanger, Digitech Whammy IV pedal, a Morley Bad Horsie 2 wah, an Ampeg Scrambler, a Vox Time Machine delay. In his amp rack, there is an ISP Decimator, and a Digitech Valve Distortion, Plus Line 6 G50 wireless systems. Doyle currently plays custom pickups build by boutique builder Sheptone. He is working with Dean Guitars on a signature Annihilator guitar that will come loaded with his signature Sheptone pickup.
