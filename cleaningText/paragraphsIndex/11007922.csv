"Seo Taiji & Boys was formed in 1991 with Seo Taiji, Lee Juno and Yang Hyun-seok. Yang said he first met Seo when the musician came to him to learn how to dance. ""Blown away"" by his music, Yang offered to join the group and they later recruited Lee who was one of the top dancers in Korea. The group was influential on the Korean music scene, famous for their single, ""Nan Arayo"" (Korean: ""난 알아요"", ""I Know""). The group received criticism for various albums, most notably for the song, ""Shidaeyugam"" (Korean: 시대유감, ""Regret of the Times""), to which the fan backlash led to the abolishment of the Pre-censorship law in 1996. The group disbanded in 1996, with each member pursuing solo activities.
