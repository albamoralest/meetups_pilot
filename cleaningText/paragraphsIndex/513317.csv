He has played a key role in recording and championing the work of Conlon Nancarrow and George Antheil, among others. In 1984, the American Music Center awarded him its Letter of Distinction for service to American composers through his work at KPFA FM in Berkeley, California. This was followed in 2005 by another for his co-founding and directing the Other Minds Festival in San Francisco.
