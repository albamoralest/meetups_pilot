"His secretary, a woman by the name of Yvonne Bouvier, asked me if I was interested in getting into film. I said yeah, I was. She said I know someone you should meet. She set up a meeting between me and Joyce Selznick, who worked for Screen Gems. I went down to 1650 Broadway, the Brill Building. On my way to a meeting with Joyce, we just happened to get on the elevator at the same time. She kept staring at me. I never met her. She never met me. We got off at the same floor and walked to the same office. That was our meeting. Joyce brought me over to Columbia Pictures about a week later and got me a contract there.

"Columbia signed Darren to a long-term contract in July 1956. A few weeks later he was filming his first film, Rumble on the Docks (1956), a low budget ""B"" movie produced by Sam Katzman, where Darren played the lead. Darren's appearance was well received and he got a lot of fan mail – second at the studio only to Kim Novak. Darren guest starred on an episode of TV's The Web (""Kill and Run"") then Columbia gave him a support role in an ""A"" picture, the comedy Operation Mad Ball (1957), starring Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs.

"Darren was third billed in the surf film, Gidget (1959), starring Sandra Dee and Cliff Robertson, playing Moondoggie, essentially the film's leading man. He also sang the title track. ""They were thinking about having someone do the vocal and I would lip sync"", he recalled. ""I told them I could do it. So we went into one of the sound stages and I sang 'Gidget'. They said, 'He sings fine,' then I did all the other songs.""The film was a hit with teen audiences and so was the song. Darren wound up recording a string of pop hits for Colpix Records, the biggest of which was ""Goodbye Cruel World"" (#3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961). It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He also recorded this song in excellent Italian, as ""Addio Mondo Crudele"", which was very successful in Europe.

If projects aren't coming to you, then you seek them out and you try to develop and put projects together.""He directed some episodes and launched a career as a director, notably of action-based series, including Hunter, The A-Team, Silk Stalkings, Renegade, and Nowhere Man, as well as dramas such as Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place.
