"""Chuck Dukowski"" is Dukowski's stage name; according to Dukowski, it originated from a Zippo lighter with ""Chuck the Duke"" inscribed on it that he found while searching for change. Feeling that the name ""Chuck the Duke"" sounded macho, he wanted to add a Polish sounding last name, as Poles were frequently picked on. He turned ""Chuck the Duke"" into ""Chuck Dukowski"". Dukowski was credited under his real name on original pressings of Black Flag's Nervous Breakdown EP as well as in film The Decline of Western Civilization and its companion soundtrack album. He is credited as ""Charles Dukowski"" on Black Flag's Damaged LP.
