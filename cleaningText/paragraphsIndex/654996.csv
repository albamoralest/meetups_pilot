"Persson grew up in Jönköping, Sweden. ""I grew up in a middle-class, academic family,"" Persson said in 2014. ""I lived in a villa with a garden. I had two younger brothers.""She did not want to be a musician growing up, having an interest in art instead, which resulted in her attending art school. ""I never really strived to be a musician; I was just, sort of, recruited into this band. I was bored out of my mind in this small, safe place (Jönköping). I was like, 'Awesome, I get to hang with fun guys.'""On 16 June 2001, Persson married American songwriter and author Nathan Larson.
