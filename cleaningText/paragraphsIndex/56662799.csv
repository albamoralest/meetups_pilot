"Néstor Mesta Cháyres was born to Florentino Mesta and Juana Cháyres in a family which included six additional children: Juanita, María Luisa, Herminia, Óscar, Jesús and Margarita in the city of Lerdo, Mexico. His initial studies in music were provided by a local teacher and an organist at the parish church. Even as a child he showed promise as an operatic singer. In his youth, he was also known to sing to a recording of Caro Nome from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto. While still in high school, he exhibited an exceptional vocal aptitude which earned him several awards. After the death of his father in 1925, he earned a scholarship to the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City. His studies included instructions in music theory, harmony, counterpoint, and voice with Lambert Castañeros - who had performed at La Scala in Milan, Italy. Néstor's professional career began in the artistic center of the Mexican capital in 1929 performing songs of Jorge del Moral and Agustín Lara at the Bolivár Amphitheater at the National Preparatory School. Soon he achieved success on the radio station X.E.B. in Mexico City, where he continued to perform for four years. By 1933 he launched a concert tour with the pianist Jorge del Moral to Havana, Cuba where he performed the waltz Divina Mujer at various theaters. He also appeared in three gala concerts for the President of the Republic during his two-month tour on the island. After returning to Mexico City in 1934, he also recorded several songs including Morena (Jorge del Moral).
