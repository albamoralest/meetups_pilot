"In 1989, Creager wrote a manifesto, and placed an ad in The Village Voice seeking women to form an electric cello choir. Julia Kent, then an editor at the Village Voice, was the first respondent. The original group of nine was whittled to three. They named themselves ""Rasputina"", after one of Creager's songs. The group performed frequently and became a local favorite in New York City. Columbia Records' A&R representative and producer Jimmy Boyle saw the group perform at a New York festival. He signed the group to the Columbia Records label in 1996.  Creager and Boyle produced their first album on Columbia titled Thanks for the Ether. In 1997 the band released Transylvanian Regurgitations, a follow up EP remixed by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez. On their second full-length album, How We Quit the Forest, Rasputina signed on Chris Vrenna (from Nine Inch Nails) as their drummer and producer.  He also provided electronic drums and sound effects. Rasputina toured with such musicians as Bob Mould, Porno for Pyros, Marilyn Manson, Siouxsie Sioux, and Les Claypool. Creager played cello with Nirvana for their final tour in Europe, 1994. The band appeared as musical guests on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on two occasions, once in 1996 and again in 1998, to promote Thanks for the Ether and How We Quit the Forest respectively. After working first with Columbia and then Instinct Records to produce their first four albums and first four EPs, the band then went on to produce all their subsequent work through Melora Creager's own record label, Filthy Bonnet Recording Co., starting with their live album A Radical Recital in 2005, and later often selling music at their live shows or through the band's website directly, with no label affiliation, beginning with The Willow Tree Triptych in 2009. These off-label releases have generally been very limited runs, often with only around 100 copies being made available. In summer 2010, a documentary was made about Rasputina called Under the Corset by Dawn Miceli. In January 2011 Melora Creager announced on The Dawn and Drew Show that Dawn Miceli would be playing the drums on the February 2011 tour. Rasputina released Unknown on April 10, 2015. The record is a concept album that exhibits the band's frontwoman, Melora Creager's, trauma after her computer was hacked into. The album is only available on CD from the band's website so, as Melora states on the site ""conceptually... anyone who purchases it is known to me."" The entire album was recorded solo by Creager in three weeks. The 2015 ""Unknown"" lineup is the first in the history of Rasputina to add piano and beat boxing, in place of traditional drums, by Luis Mojica. On June 26, 2015 Rasputina released a compilation of demo recordings from 1991 to 1997 titled ""Magnetic Strip"" and was only available by digital download on the band's website. In the fall of 2016, Polly Panic joined Rasputina as the second cellist. The first tour of the line up with Melora, Polly Panic as second cellist/backing vocalist, and Luis Mojica as keyboardist/beat boxer and backing vocalist. In July 2017, Melora Creager announced a new album, The Feel-Good Hits of 1817. In her email newsletter, she stated that the album would be vinyl-only, and limited in quantity. The album None but the Lonely Heart was released through the band's website in 2018. The album is a collection of piano covers performed by Creager, including songs by Patti Smith, Duke Ellington, The Smiths, and Carl Sandburg. The title is taken from the Tchaikovsky song of the same name, which also serves as the first track on the album. In 2019, the album Skin is Living Leather was released on the band's website. It features nine songs, three of which are covers, five new songs written by Creager, and one which was co-written with Creager's daughter Ivy.
