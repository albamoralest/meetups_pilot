"Gordon made multiple remarks to Dutch-Chinese contestant Xiao Wang on the TV show Holland's Got Talent in November 2013. Comments, mainly referring to Chinese restaurants, such as ""Which number are you singing? Number 39 with rice?"", ""Surplise!"", ""He looks like a waiter from a Chinese restaurant"", and ""This is the best Chinese I've had in weeks, and it's not a takeaway"", have been described as racist and highly offensive to those of Chinese and Asian heritage. Within a few days after the broadcast, the clip went viral online, and Gordon's comments drew heavy criticism on international media and social media outlets. The Amsterdam Discrimination Hotline (""MDRA"") issued a letter to the show asking for an explanation of Gordon's behavior, and states that while humor and exaggeration are generally acceptable on a public platform, ""there is a line that can't be crossed"", and ""the singer has the potential of influencing a large group"". On 27 November 2013, the hotline filed an official complaint with RTL Nederland in regard to Gordon's treatment of Xiao Wang. Gordon initially responded that he ""thinks jokes like that are acceptable and innocent"", that he ""is not a racist"", and that he ""does not feel the need to apologise"". Performer Xiao Wang was quoted as saying that he ""felt somewhat slighted"" and ""disliked the 'jokes'"". Over time, Gordon reconsidered his position, and in February 2020, he publicly apologised for his remarks, vowing he would not let it happen again. Gordon: No More Chinese Jokes

He wanted an end to anonymous threats and homophobia that he and others had received. Dekker called it an interesting proposal that he'd take up with European colleagues.
