"Cao was the musical director for both the 1973 and 1984 Eurovision Song Contests, staged in the Grand Duchy at the Nouveau Theatre. He conducted Luxembourg's winning song ""Tu te reconnaîtras"" in 1973. As such, he was the only conductor ever conducting one of Luxembourg's five winning Eurovision entries. Unusually, he did not conduct Luxembourg's entry in 1984 (it was conducted by Pascal Stive), despite being the show's musical director. He did however conduct the German and Cypriot entries.
