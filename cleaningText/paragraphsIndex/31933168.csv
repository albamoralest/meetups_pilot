"B-Complex began producing music in 1996 at the age of 12, being mainly interested in hardcore, trance, and psytrance, moving on to downtempo and hip hop. Following this period, she shifted to drum and bass, with the intention of creating a unique personal style. The artist's first major label release was ""Beautiful Lies"", which appeared on the compilation Sick Music from Hospital Records. The compilation went on to reach the top 30 on the iTunes UK Download Chart, and was in the top 5 on the Beatport Drum and Bass Chart. Her first UK show was in September 2009 at Matter nightclub in London, for a Hospitality night. She started to use a female version of her name in 2015.
