"Abdul Vas work broaches heavily the obsessions of his home country Venezuela with the symbols of the American dream. Heavily influenced by Marc Chagall, Mike Kelley, Al Feldstein and James Ensor, Vas's work heavily consists of depictions of aggressive and well-hung roosters that represent the masculine element of the American cowboy-culture. Therefore, his pictures are full of references to the American baseball team Cincinnati Reds, MLB, Malcolm Young,  the Rolling Stones, Slayer, Metallica, the Black Crowes, Muddy Waters, SUVs, rock and roll and the symbols of the North American imperialist power: the Navistar trucks. Another common theme in his work is the Australian rock group AC/DC, particularly lead singer Brian Johnson. Many of his other artworks are named after AC/DC songs or albums.
