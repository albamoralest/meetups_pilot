"Steinweiss was born into a musical family in New York City. His parents worked in the Jewelry business and were very supportive of his interest in music. He began playing music in the early 1990s after watching a conga player in the jazz band at his sister's Manhattan high school. When his conga teacher became unavailable he switched to drums. Steinweiss was initially interested in grunge but an early drum teacher, Matt Patuto, guided him to the music of James Brown and The Meters.
