"Cibelle Cavalli Bastos was born in São Paulo, Brazil, on 2 January 1978. They attended the Marcelo Tupinambá Conservatory in São Paulo from the age of 6, where they studied guitar, piano, percussion and theatre. They had a short career modelling in their teens, but left it to dedicate themselves to acting and art. They worked in musicals, short films, and Brazilian TV, until music took a stronger lead in their life, followed by their focus in art practice and research. After meeting the Serbian-born producer Suba, they appeared as the main vocalist on his album, São Paulo Confessions, on Ziriguiboom (Crammed Discs' Brazilian imprint) in 1999. A mixture of traditional and electronic sounds, São Paulo Confessions is regarded as an important precursor and a landmark album for Brazilian Electronic Music. Suba died shortly after the album's release. Cibelle next appeared on Celso Fonseca's album, Natural (2003). Their first solo album, Cibelle, was also released in 2003. Signed to Belgian record label Crammed Discs, at the age of 22, they started spending more time in Europe, specifically Paris. By the completion of their first album, they moved to London's Brick Lane in East London.

"Cibelle creates concept albums. Their band is made up of around 10 musicians or more who each get together as trios. Cibelle works by building tracks live on stage, with special guests and audience members contributing to their ""bric-a-brac DIY"" sound through vocals, playfulness and instrumental experimentation.  Since moving to Dalston, they have been working more with visual arts and performance, taking part in the abravanista movement with Rick Castro – also a part of Assume Vivid Astro Focus – and collaborating as a part of collective and artzine FUR, run by photographer Cássia Cabatini and artist/printmaker Fábio Gurjão.
