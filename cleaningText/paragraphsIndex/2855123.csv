"In January 2017, after the results of the 2016 United States presidential election and her tour in support of New View, Friedberger took a trip to Athens, Greece, out of a desire to reconnect with her Greek heritage and to explore the Greek music scene. While there, on the recommendation of a friend, she visited an '80s-themed goth nightclub called Rebound, which made an impression on her and ultimately became the namesake of her fourth studio album. For Rebound, Friedberger adopted a more pop-influenced sound, recording most of the music herself and using synthesizers and drum machines as opposed to the live bands which characterized her earlier solo work. On February 14, 2018, Friedberger announced that Rebound would be released on May 4; in conjunction with the announcement, she released the lead single from the project, titled ""In Between Stars;"" several weeks later, she released an accompanying music video, which she had filmed herself with assistance from former Sonic Youth frontwoman Kim Gordon. On April 20, 2018, ""Everything"" was released as the second single from the album, ahead of its release; an accompanying music video was directed by Jonah Freud. On May 4, 2018, Rebound was released by Frenchkiss Records. The album drew universal acclaim from music critics, who noted Friedberger's stylistic departure. It became Friedberger's fourth consecutive top-twenty entry on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, where it peaked at number 20.
