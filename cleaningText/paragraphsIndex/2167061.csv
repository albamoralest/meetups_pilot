"In 2012, he was in a duo with friend and former EMF frontman James Atkin called 'Asbo Kid'. He also played drums for local Brighton bands Das Fenster and Oscillator. In 2013, Welch briefly re-united with Suede for several gigs to replace drummer Simon Gilbert who was unable to play due to contracting tuberculosis. It was announced, in September 2015, that Welch would play drums in the newly reformed Lush. On 21 January 2017, Elastica's official Facebook page posted photos featuring three-fourths of the original line-up - Welch, Donna Matthews and Annie Holland - during a visit to Abbey Road Studios in London. Mastering engineer Sean McGee tweeted that he had just ""cut a record for Elastica today"" and that the band members ""hadn't seen each other for 20 years."" The specific details of the record have yet to be announced, but in response to fan comments regarding Frischmann's absence in the photos, the Facebook page stated that, ""Justine's involved in what's happening too."" In December 2017, the Elastica Facebook page announced that Welch featured on a new British rock band, The Rockerati's debut single ""16 Tons"". A post on Welch's personal Facebook page noted that the release had been receiving substantial radio airplay in the US.
