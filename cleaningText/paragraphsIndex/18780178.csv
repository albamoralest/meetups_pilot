"After Ultravox!, Shears formed a band with his friend Ice, real name Roland Oxland, bassist of Gloria Mundi. Gloria Mundi and Ultravox! were friends from the UK live music scene. Gloria Mundi featured Eddie Maelov and Sunshine Patterson who, as Eddie & Sunshine, would support Ultravox on their 1981 Rage in Eden tour. Gloria Mundi's saxophonist CC also played on 'Hiroshima Mon Amour' from Ultravox's second album Ha! Ha! Ha! (1977). Later Shears and Jason Guy formed a duo called New Men. This was short-lived, as Shears left to join Cowboys International, in early 1980, replacing Adam Ant's guitarist Marco Pirroni. In 1981 and with Cowboys International dissolved, he collaborated with the band's singer, Ken Lockie, on his solo album, The Impossible.
