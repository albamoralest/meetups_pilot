"Banhart's music is often referred to as psychedelic folk, freak folk and New Weird America, and is associated with acts such as singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom, musical group CocoRosie, and contemporary folk band Vetiver. The New York Times has called his work ""free associative work"" and SPIN magazine has described it as ""ashram-appropriate guitar strums"" and ""trippy-hippie tone poetry."" Critics have compared Banhart's style to that of 1970s band Tyrannosaurus Rex, an early version of British rock musician Marc Bolan's T. Rex, though in a 2004 interview Banhart stated that he was unaware of Tyrannosaurus Rex until after he began writing and recording music. Banhart has cited Vashti Bunyan, Simón Díaz, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Arthur Russell, Ali Farka Touré, and Caetano Veloso as his main influences.

"Banhart was born in Houston, Texas to a Venezuelan mother, María Eugenia Rísquez, and an American father, Robert Gary Banhart. His given name is a synonym for Indra, suggested by Indian religious leader Prem Rawat (whom Banhart's parents followed), and his middle name Obi takes after Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Star Wars character. His parents divorced in 1983, after which Rísquez and he moved to Caracas, Venezuela. Rísquez later remarried and when Banhart was 14, his stepfather moved the family to Los Angeles, California.

"In 1998, Banhart began studying at the San Francisco Art Institute on a scholarship while living in The Castro, San Francisco's ""gay"" district, though he would often busk instead of attending class. He played his first show in a church at a gay wedding, performing Elvis Presley's ""Love Me Tender"" and the hymn ""How Great Thou Art"". Banhart dropped out of school in 2000 and left San Francisco after the dot-com bubble bust worsened the city's economy. That summer, he moved to Paris, France and began opening shows for indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Banhart returned to the United States that fall and played music in San Francisco and Los Angeles, until he was discovered by Michael Gira, owner of Young God Records, after Siobhan Duffy, Gira's wife, bought a copy of Banhart's demo CD The Charles C. Leary and gave it to Gira. Banhart and Gira compiled an album from Banhart's recordings, and in 2002, Oh Me Oh My, which was made up of short fragments, was published by Young God Records and received favorable reviews. He recorded two other albums and an EP for the label: Rejoicing in the Hands, Niño Rojo, and The Black Babies; the releases had a simple acoustic sound. Banhart changed to XL Recordings in 2005 and released Cripple Crow, which was recorded in Bearsville Studios, New York and had a more elaborate sound. Banhart's albums offer a variety of musical sounds, and he is often called the leader of the musical movement termed ""Freak Folk."" His lyrics are fantastical, idealistic, and poetic with the occasional trace of innuendos. In 2005 Banhart collaborated with Antony and the Johnsons on the award-winning album I Am a Bird Now. He sings the introduction to the song ""Spiraling"" and plays guitar on ""You Are My Sister"" in which Boy George also appears.
