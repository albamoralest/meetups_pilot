"Aurela Gaçe was born on 16 October 1974 into an Albanian family in the village of Llakatund, Vlorë, then part of the People's Socialist Republic, present Albania. In 2010 Gaçe won the 49th edition of ""Festivali i Këngës"" with ""Kënga Ime"", written by Shpëtim Saraçi. Her most successful song Origjinale (feat. Dr. Flori & Marsel) has more than 8 million views on YouTube. After experiencing success during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gaçe quit singing and moved to the United States where she spent 8 years. She returned to the music industry in 2010 releasing ""Origjinale"", a song composed by Flori Mumajesi, that became a success in Albania. In late 2010, Gaçe was invited by Shpëtim Saraçi to participate in the Festivali i Këngës. Initially she denied the request, as she stated ""It is time for new artists to be promoted with original music performed by an orchestra"". However, she later decided to participate.
