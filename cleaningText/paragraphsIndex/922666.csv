"Peter Koelewijn was born on 29 December 1940, the son of a fishmonger in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven. At the age of thirteen, he received his first guitar.  In 1957, he started writing his first songs in English. He started his first band at secondary school with guitarists Karel Jansen and Roelof Egmond and singer Anneke Grönloh. Later on, Harry van Hoof (who later became a famous conductor), and drummer Peter van der Voort, joined the band. Around the same time, Grönloh left the band. Koelewijn has two children, Kim and Joep, who share his musical talent.

"In 1959 the band, now called 'Peter and his Rockets', was joined by saxophone player Klaus Buchholz and bass guitarist Karel Jansen. In December, the band recorded ""Kom Van Dat Dak Af"" for record company Bovema. The combination of American rock and roll and Dutch lyrics was quite revolutionary at the time. In May 1960, ""Kom Van Dat Dak Af"" was a massive success in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Koelewijn, who moved on to grammar school, was told by his parents that he had to finish his schooling. Peter and His Rockets signed at Philips.
