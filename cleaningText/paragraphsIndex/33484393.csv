"Beyond the scoring stage and in the studio, Luppi has put forward a string of releases that exemplify various eras of Italian music. His first album, An Italian Story paid homage to vintage 60s and 70s soundstage compositions and benefited from contributions by members of The Marc 4. Rome, the conceptual and spiritual follow-up to his debut album, was heralded as “purely gorgeous” by Pitchfork, seen as a foray into the mainstream and was praised for its collaborations with Jack White, Norah Jones, and Danger Mouse. MILANO, Luppi’s 2017 full-length album featuring accompaniment from Karen O and Parquet Courts, is the final volume of his Italian trilogy. Whereas his previous work called on a cinematic era in Italian music, MILANO examined the gritty 1980s New York no wave and punk scene and its influence on Milanese music, fashion, and high-art and served as a finale acknowledging Italy’s famed arts and culture.
