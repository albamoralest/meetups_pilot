"Avery Hutley was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. Following the influence of her older sisters, she joined her primary school's concert band in her third year, and learned to play the euphonium. At the same time, she also took piano lessons, but was disinterested. In an interview, she expressed that she regretted not learning earlier. In the same interview, Hutley stated that her first electronic musical inspiration was a childhood friend, Luke Midworth (known under the name areographe) and that in her youth she did not ""get"" electronic music. Hutley only began making electronic music after discovering Ableton Live through Midworth.

"Hutley considers her music under the name Cherax Destructor to be ""folktronica / friendship-hop"". Cherax Destructor's music has been compared by Under the Radar to the works of Baths. In contrast, Hutley refers to helpful kappa as ""post-rock"", citing Sigur Rós and Explosions in the Sky as her main influences, and refers to ᴅᴀɪᴋᴜ ɪɴᴅᴜsᴛʀɪᴇs as ""breakcore / bass music"" inspired by Yoko Kanno and Hiroyuki Sawano.

"In 2013, the track <3 from the album Amity Lines was described by Under the Radar, a popular American indie music magazine, as ""joyful melodies – all chopped up and twisted into one another"". Hutley was also described later that year to have ""pioneered the 'friendship-hop' movement"", by BULLSH!T, a partially satirical Australian media outlet. The song <3 was also aired in 2013 on 2SER, an Australian radio station, in a feature entitled The Band Next Door, in which alternative and underground Australian musicians are showcased. Cherax Destructor was one of the headlining acts of AVCon's 2015 JOYPAD after-dark party in Adelaide, Australia. AVCon described Hutley as ""a conflicted soul"", but said that her music fuses her passions ""into something weird and wonderful"".
