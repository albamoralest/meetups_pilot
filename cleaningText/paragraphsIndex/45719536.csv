"Because Olivia Jean did not have a band to record with in Nashville, Jack White introduced her to musicians Shelby Lynne and Ruby Rogers. The group went into the studio and recorded a handful of Jean's original songs including ""What Can I Do?"", later released as the first single by The Black Belles. After their success in the studio, the group decided to become a band.
