"In her early days, she sang at the Astor Roof in New York City. After singing with her sister's orchestra in 1938, she was part of the Winston Trio, the Quintones, and the Sande Williams Band. She appeared with the Quintones in Hi Ya, Gentlemen, a failed musical with boxer Max Baer. In 1941, she became the female vocalist for the Stardusters, the singing group of Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra. After Jo Stafford left The Pied Pipers in 1944, Hutton replaced her, joining the group in May. She performed with the Pied Pipers for six years, recording several hit records including the song ""Dream."" In 1950, Hutton left the Pied Pipers, going solo on Decca Records. (However, the trade publication Billboard reported in its December 10, 1949, issue that Hutton had already left the Pied Pipers and signed with Decca Records.)
