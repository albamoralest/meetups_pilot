"Thomas is a successful rock and roll musician in Canada. His solo career peaked during the 1970s; his most memorable hit was 1973's ""Painted Ladies"". Success in the American market, however, has proven to be elusive with the possible exception of ""Painted Ladies"", which remains his only U.S. Top 40 hit. He has also done musical composition for about a dozen films and television shows. Before breaking through with ""Painted Ladies"", he was a producer at the CBC. Before that, he was part of the folk music group Tranquility Base.
