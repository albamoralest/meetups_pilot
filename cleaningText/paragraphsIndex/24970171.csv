"He began his career in 1988 playing bass for the Brazilian thrash metal band The Mist, who had just changed their name from Mayhem following a number of line-up changes. On their first album Phantasmagoria released in 1989, they most notably featured Chakal singer Vladimir Korg on vocals and boasted a twin guitar line-up displaying a progressive mix of aggressive thrash and gothic atmosphere. For their second album, 1991's The Hangman Tree, former Sepultura guitarist Jairo Guedz took over full guitar duties for the band, reducing the band to a four-piece whilst further expanding the unique sound of the debut. Vocalist Korg left after the second album, further reducing the line-up to a trio for which Marcelo took over vocal duties for their third album, Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust released in 1993 which showed the band adopting a more contemporary groove-metal sound. Following this release, Marcelo left the band and was replaced by Cassiano Gobbet on both bass and vocals for their final album, 1995's Gottverlassen before splitting in 1997.
