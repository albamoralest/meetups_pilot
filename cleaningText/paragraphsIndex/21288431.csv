"Bryce first crossed paths with Kronos Quartet in 2009 when the ensemble's founder David Harrington approached him about composing a piece for their performance at the Celebrate Brooklyn! festival in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. The piece that Bryce wrote, Aheym, (meaning ""homeward"" in Yiddish), was inspired by the stories of his Jewish immigrant grandparents who settled near the park when they arrived in Brooklyn. In 2011, Bryce was commissioned by Kronos Quartet to compose a piece for the Barbican Centre's ""Reverberations: The Influence of Steve Reich"" festival in London. That piece, Tenebre, is based on the traditional Holy Week service in which 15 candles are gradually extinguished. Bryce, in his own words, ""inverts the service"" drawing the listener from darkness into light. Tenebre premiered May 7, 2011 at LSO St. Luke's and featured the pre-recorded vocals of Sufjan Stevens. Bryce continues to work with Kronos, recently writing and dedicating Little Blue Something (2012) to them.
