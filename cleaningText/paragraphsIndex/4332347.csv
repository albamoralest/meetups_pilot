"He was born in Hurst Hill, Wolverhampton, England. Singing since the 1960s in folk clubs and festivals, in 1973 Caddick joined the street theatre group Magic Lantern, formed by Taffy Thomas and described by Mel McClellan on the BBC website as ""legendary"". He left Magic Lantern in 1975 to concentrate on his solo career, becoming well known as a festival artist in Britain and overseas. In 1977, he joined the Albion Band in the National Theatre productions of Lark Rise and The Passion. Caddick later collaborated with Tim Laycock and Peter Bond in a stage show and album about circus life, called A Duck on his Head. About this time, he wrote songs for radio and TV, and performed his own songs in a film about the Tolpuddle Martyrs. From 1980 to 1985, Caddick was a member of the renowned folk-rock band Home Service. He continued to write and perform at clubs and festivals, albeit in a more low-key way than before, as well as continuing his involvement with the National Theatre, writing and appearing in several plays which included Don Quixote, and The Mysteries (an award-winning trilogy performed in the West End, on TV and throughout Europe, as well as at the National).
