"Leticia (""Tish"") Hinojosa (born December 6, 1955, San Antonio, Texas) is a folksinger recording in both Spanish and English. Hinojosa was the youngest of 13 children. Hinojosa's parents were Mexican immigrants.  Known for singing both traditional Mexican folksongs and her own original songs, both in Spanish and English, Hinojosa accompanies herself on guitar, which she plays right-handed although she is naturally lefthanded. Influenced by traditional Mexican, folk, Tejano, conjunto, and country musics, Hinojosa considers her music to be music of the US/Mexico border. Hinojosa has recorded numerous albums and has charted twice on the Billboard country charts.  Her 1992 album Culture Swing won the National Association of Independent Record Distributors (NAIRD) Indie Folk Album of the Year. Using music to bring awareness to cultural issues, Hinojosa hopes to bring into focus the plight of migrant workers and children of the poor. Additionally, she often performs children's music of her culture to help children develop an understanding of the Southwest's Hispanic traditions. As of 2021, Hinajosa lives in both Austin, Texas and Tubac, Arizona.  In the 1970s and 1980s she also lived in Taos, New Mexico and Nashville, Tennessee.  In 2005, Hinojosa moved to Germany, and in 2013 returned to Austin.
