"Born in London in the early 1950s, he became interested in blues music in the late 1960s, so he learnt to play his sister's acoustic guitar.  Being left-handed, he turned the guitar over, without reversing the strings, so he learnt and continues to play ""upside-down"".

"After his first band, The Breath of Life, he played in Streatham folk-rock band Garfield Row, who were helped by Glenn Cornick.  After playing in several blues, folk-rock and country bands, he ended up playing and writing for rock band Panama Scandal.  He joined blues band Sam Apple Pie in the mid-1970s, after they had already recorded both their albums, and shortly before they became The Vipers.

"Outside of music Fletcher is a keen racing driver, although he only took this up in his mid-40s.  Initially competing in the '95/'96  Ford Credit Fiesta Challenge, his first win came in July '98 at Castle Combe in the Proton Coupe Cup and he came third overall in the '99 Championship.  As music commitments limit the number of races he can compete in, he became a racing instructor.
