"Decibully was an indie rock band based out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin that formed in 2001 and played their final show early in 2011. The band signed to Polyvinyl Records in August 2003. In March and April 2004, the band went on a West Coast tour with Onelinedrawing, Cardia, and Roy. They released their second studio album Sing Out America! on March 8, 2005, which was promoted with tours of Europe and North America with the Snake the Cross the Crown and Codeseven. Later in the year, they toured with Lucero and Blackpool Lights. Decibully's final two albums, World Travels Fast & ""Self Titled"" (Ta Da, Booyah, Chainsaw, Us) were released by Listening Party Records. Decibully successfully toured the US, Canada & Europe multiple times. Each record was recorded & produced in-house by Ryan Weber.
