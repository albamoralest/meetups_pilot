"Paul Black and Cripps formed Faster Pussycat (named after the movie Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and later the name of a separate band), in 1985. The group's lineup included Tracii Guns and Nickey Alexander. Shortly afterwards, the band (now with Rob Stoddard in the band too) reformed L.A. Guns. With L.A. Guns, he was a part of the band's ""classic"" lineup (Phil Lewis, Guns, Kelly Nickels, Cripps and Steve Riley) and played guitar and keyboards, as well as songwriting duties. He performed and wrote on the albums L.A. Guns, Cocked & Loaded, Hollywood Vampires, Vicious Circle, and Man in the Moon. Cripps left the group in 1995, rejoining in 1999 for a reunion of the ""classic"" lineup, although his time in the band was shortlived, leaving by 2001. He was invited to participate in the recording of the band's 2012 album Hollywood Forever, but declined to participate.
