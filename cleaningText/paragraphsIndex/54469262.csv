"Akello has a striking resemblance to Kenyan and Oscar award winner Lupita Nyong'o. During shooting of the film Queen of Katwe, most people and journalists that met or saw a photo of Akello thought it was Nyong'o since everyone knew she was the country shooting the movie. The circus started when Akello's photo was published on Maurice Kirya's Facebook page to promote a music video for the song ""Busabala"" in which Jackie acted, which raised a lot of attention to the singer.
