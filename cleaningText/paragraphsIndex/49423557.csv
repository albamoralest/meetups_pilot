They returned to the venue in 2012 for another Carlebach tribute concert, this time joined by Yehudah Katz, Chaim-Dovid Saracik, Shlomo Katz, and Aharon Razel.

"Solomon met his wife, Dina, while living in California. Prior to meeting Carlebach, they were hippies and lived on a commune in northern California. Dina is currently a caterer and nutritionist and published the cookbook Wild Figs for Breakfast. The Solomons were among the first families to settle in Carlebach's moshav Mevo Modi'im upon its establishment in 1976, handpicked by Carlebach himself. Actor Eric Anderson stayed at their house for Shabbat as preparation to play Carlebach in the Broadway musical Soul Doctor. Several of Solomon's sons have become prominent Jewish musicians: Noah Solomon co-founded Soulfarm with C Lanzbom; Yehuda, Yosef, and Meir Solomon formed the Moshav Band with fellow Mevo Modi'im resident Duvid Swirsky; and Nachman Solomon formed Hamakor. Nachman, Yosef, and Sruli Solomon also perform together as the Solomon Brothers Band.
