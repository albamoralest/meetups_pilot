"Keen was born and grew up in Houston, Texas, United States. As a teenager, Keen was an avid reader who excelled in writing and literature classes. Keen was a fan of the English rock band Cream, and was influenced by country music by artists like Willie Nelson. He started playing guitar himself shortly thereafter, learning to play classic country covers out of a songbook the summer before starting college at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas he attended Sharpstown High School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1978 and began writing songs and playing bluegrass and folk music with friends, including his childhood friend (and future longtime fiddle player in his band) Bryan Duckworth.

"In 1978, Keen graduated from Texas A&M and moved to Austin, Texas. He performed in Austin's nightclubs and live music venues like the Cactus Cafe and Gruene Hall in nearby New Braunfels. In 1983, Keen won the New Folk competition at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Kerrville, Texas. That same year, he began making his self-produced first album, No Kinda Dancer. Keen returned to Texas, in Nashville he signed a publishing deal, a new independent label deal, and signed with a national booking agent. After the release of his second and third albums, 1988's The Live Album and 1989's West Textures, he began to have commercial success. West Textures featured the first recording of what would soon become Keen's signature song, ""The Road Goes on Forever"". Fellow Texan Joe Ely recorded the song on his 1993 album Love and Danger, along with another Keen song, ""Whenever Kindness Fails"". Keen's own version of ""Whenever Kindness Fails"" appeared on his fourth album, 1993's A Bigger Piece of Sky. In 1994, he released Gringo Honeymoon. In 1996, he released No. 2 Live Dinner. Keen has continued to write, record, and tour in the United States. His 1997 album, Picnic, marked the beginning of his on-again, off-again relationship with major labels (both that album and 1998's Walking Distance were issued on Arista Records, and 2001's Gravitational Forces, 2009's The Rose Hotel and 2011's Ready for Confetti were released on Lost Highway Records). Keen's other albums include 2003's Farm Fresh Onions (Audium/Koch Records) and 2005's What I Really Mean and 2006's Live at the Ryman (both on E1 Music). The producers with whom he has worked on those albums have included John Keane, Gurf Morlix, Gary Velletri, and Lloyd Maines.
