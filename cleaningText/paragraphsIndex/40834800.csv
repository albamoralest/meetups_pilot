"By 1964 he was ready to work full-time in music, and joined The Burnettes from Folkestone who had Leverton's friend Noel Redding on guitar. They broke up 18 months later having released two singles. Leverton soon joined another band with Noel Redding, The Loving Kind (1965–67) formerly The Lonely Ones. They released three singles for Pye Records including a cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't That Peculiar"". Redding left the band to join the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but The Loving Kind continued for a while and Leverton worked as a session musician with Tom Jones, Gilbert O'Sullivan and Engelbert Humperdinck.

That was the start of a long working relationship with Marriott until his death in 1991. Marriott and Leverton were together in a succession of Marriott led bands, including Steve Marriott and Packet of Three (1980-1991). The album Majik Mijits was recorded with Marriott and Ronnie Lane and was released in 2000. A number of live albums are also still available today.
