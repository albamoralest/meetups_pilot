"Thompson was born in Springfield, Ohio, United States, on March 21, 1918. His father was a minister and his stepmother played the piano. ""He first studied violin and briefly played tenor saxophone, but took up piano as a teenager."" He moved with his family to Parsons, Kansas, in the southeastern part of the state. Later Thompson attended a Kansas City high school. By the age of twelve, Thompson was playing private parties with Bennie Moten and his band in Colorado Springs, Colorado. During this time, Count Basie played off and on with Moten's band. During a show Basie called Thompson up to perform. He was dubbed Sir Charles Thompson by Lester Young.

"Thompson chiefly worked with small groups, including the Coleman Hawkins/Howard McGhee sextet in 1944–1945. Throughout the 1940s he played and recorded with Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis and J.C. Heard, among others. He played with Lucky Millinder's big band in 1946, and under Illinois Jacquet in 1947–48 and 1952. He worked freelance, principally on organ, for much of the 1950s. He played with Parker again in 1953 and recorded with Vic Dickenson and Buck Clayton in 1953–54. Thompson worked with Earl Bostic in the late 1950s before heading his own quartet in 1959. In the early 1960s, he toured Europe and Canada with Buck Clayton. Thompson was in Europe again in 1964, with Jazz at the Philharmonic, and in 1967 for the show Jazz from a Swinging Era. ""Living variously on the West Coast, where he often worked with Vernon Alley, and in Toronto, Paris, and Zurich, he continued to lead small groups through the 1970s and 1980s."" He composed the jazz standard ""Robbins' Nest"". He died on June 16, 2016 at the age of 98 in a hospital near Tokyo, Japan. He had lived in the country with his wife Makiko since 2002. Earlier he had a daughter, now known as Tina Hoffman, with blues/jazz singer Lauricia Lorraine Balsz. She has become a singer-songwriter.
