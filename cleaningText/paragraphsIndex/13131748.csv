"Malloy studied music at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle, Washington. He got his first break when he was signed to RCA. Malloy's self-titled first album featured session musicians such as Mickey Curry, Hugh McDonald and Michael Thompson. His first single as a solo artist on RCA records, ""Anything At All"", was a top 20 rock charting hit and a pop hit in the US. His third single, ""Our Love Will Never Die"", earned him an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. His second album, Ceilings And Walls, featured guest musicians such as Bernie Leadon, Mike Rutherford and Paul Carrack. He auditioned to be the singer of hard rock band Van Halen after Sammy Hagar's departure.  Malloy recorded various demos with the band, and Eddie Van Halen gave Malloy an instrumental demo to use for his own endeavors. This song was released by Malloy in 2015 as ""It's the Right Time"".  The riff reemerged in the sessions leading up to Van Halen's 1998 studio album Van Halen III in the song ""That's Why I Love You.""  The song was scrapped from the record in favor of ""Josephina.""Malloy has had a lengthy career featuring in various bands as lead singer, releasing solo albums, and making guest appearances as well. His latest album marks his first time completing an entire release all on his own.
