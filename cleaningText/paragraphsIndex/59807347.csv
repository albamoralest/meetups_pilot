She has also released music herself as an artist, including two albums and numerous singles. Three singles made the UK Singles Chart; ""Rewind"", ""Runaway Skies"" and ""Sorry (You Lied to Me)"" (with Masterstepz). She has also featured as vocalist on several songs such as ""My Friend"" by Groove Armada and on UK garage songs such as ""You Got Me Singing"" and ""There I Go"" with Y-Tribe, as well as ""Sorry (You Lied to Me)"". After two years touring with Groove Armada, Celetia temporarily moved to LA to pursue songwriting where she worked with producers Soulshock and Karlin, Ron Fair and The Underdogs. She co-wrote the songs ""Goin' Crazy"" for Ashley Tisdale (from Headstrong) and ""Bubblegum"" for the Slumber Party Girls (from Dance Revolution). ""Bubblegum"" was then the most requested song on Disney Radio. In 2014, Celetia entered a new business venture with the head of Royalty Network publishing, Frank Liwall to form her own publishing company, Forty Nine Publishing, for her to scout and sign upcoming new writers and producers.
