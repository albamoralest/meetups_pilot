"Shortly after being introduced to Project Blowed by SP83, Psychosiz requested membership in the newly formed group Customer Service alongside SP83, Kail, Y-Not, JoeSue, A-ok, and group leader Nocando. Psychosiz formed Thirsty Fish alongside Open Mike Eagle and Dumbfoundead. The trio released the debut album Testing the Waters in 2007. The second album, Watergate, was released on Mush Records in 2011. Shortly after the formation of Thirsty Fish, Psychosiz expanded the roster to include several more Los Angeles rappers to the Project Blowed scene. Psychosiz has been featured on several solo projects by Swim Team members including Sahtyre's debut album High Saht.
