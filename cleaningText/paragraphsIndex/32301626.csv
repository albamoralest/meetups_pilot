"Zoltan Csörsz was born on 4 July 1976 in Hungary. He began playing drums at age five, and won an international talent contest in Hungary at age nine. Csörsz went on to win numerous other awards in Hungary, and eventually moved on to formal music training in Hungary and eventually the Jazz Institute in Malmö, Sweden, where he played in a variety of different bands. In May 2001 when The Flower Kings' drummer, Jaime Salazar, left the band, keyboardist Tomas Bodin suggested Csörsz because he was impressed by the drummer's skill, as he had played with him in previous projects as well as seeing him in various bands around Sweden. Csörsz stayed with The Flower Kings before leaving the band in 2005. He then rejoined the band in 2007 to record their tenth album, The Sum of No Evil. He currently is in his own band, The Zoltan Csörsz Trio.
