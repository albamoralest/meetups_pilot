"John Pål Inderberg (born 6 August 1950 Steinkjer, Norway) is a versatile saxophonist with a natural spontaneity of expression and one of the leading traditional musicians in Norway. His playing synthethises many different styles, not least when in partnership with Norwegian and American jazz musicians - players as contrasting as Gil Evans and Lee Konitz.
