"DNA was the name taken by English electronic music producers Nick Batt and Neal Slateford, best known for releasing a remix of Suzanne Vega's ""Tom's Diner"" in 1990. As well as ""Tom's Diner"", the duo remixed two other Suzanne Vega tracks: ""Rusted Pipe"" in 1991, and a radio mix of ""Rosemary"" in 2000. After a brief lull, the duo reappeared with a mix of the Loreena McKennitt track ""The Mummers' Dance"", which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart in 1997.
