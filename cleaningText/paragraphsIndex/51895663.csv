"Donnelly was born near Kylemore Abbey in Loughrea in East Galway, Ireland. She now lives in Quin, County Clare . She has been playing music since she was a child and won her first All-Ireland Fiddle Competition when she was nine despite her parents not being musicians. However her family has developed a musical tradition with her three brothers playing the accordion, banjo, and fiddle. Donnelly toured the US for the 1976 Bicentennial celebration, and again in 1978 and 1983. She went on to win two more All-Ireland fiddle titles in the 1970s and the National Slogadh Competition for Solo Fiddle and The Stone Fiddle Competition in County Fermanagh in 1981. Donnelly went to college in Dublin and when she graduated she moved to live in Clare. She works touring, recording and tutoring when she isn't working as a teacher.
