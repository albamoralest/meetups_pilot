Her students included Christopher Reeve, Robin Williams, Kelsey Grammer, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, Patti LuPone, Val Kilmer, and Kevin Spacey.

"In December 2008, for their annual birthday celebration to ""The Master"", Noël Coward, the Noël Coward Society invited Seldes as the guest celebrity to lay flowers in front of Coward's statue at New York's Gershwin Theatre, thereby commemorating the playwright’s 109th birthday. Seldes was the recipient of a 2010 Tony Lifetime Achievement Award. ""All I've done is live my life in the theater and loved it ... If you can get an award for being happy, that's what I've got.""In 2012, Seldes played the knife-wielding socialite Mabel Billingsly in the film adaptation of Wendy Mass' popular children's book Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life, written and directed by Tamar Halpern.

"Seldes had one child, Katharine, by her first marriage to Julian Claman. They were divorced in 1961. Seldes stated that the marriage to Claman was violent. ""If I sound a little vague about that marriage, it's because I don't understand the person in it. Me. I literally didn't know that people could be abusive."" Seldes left the marriage after her father noticed marks on her face. Seldes was married to screenwriter/playwright Garson Kanin from 1990 until his death in 1999.

""Rick"" Rodgers, chronicling Seldes' last years, had created ""consternation in the theater world"" as a ""horrific, intrusive depiction of her slide into dementia"".
