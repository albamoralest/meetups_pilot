"By 1980 the pipeline of young musicians coming out of the Eastman School of Music had become a strong stream of young jazz artists for Woody Herman's big band.  Recently graduated from Eastman, on July 6 of 1980 Oddo joined the Herman organization along with John Fedchock, Steve Harrow and Mike Brignola.   Oddo would quickly become a star in the long line of pianists/arrangers for Herman dating back to Ralph Burns, Nat Pierce and Alan Broadbent; he would serve as the band's primary arranger 1980-1984.   Two notable albums with Concord Records were produced during this time featuring Oddo as both pianist and musical arranger/director: The Woody Herman Big Band Live at the Concord Jazz Festival (1981) and World Class (1982, live from Osaka, Japan).   Both of these Concord releases would go on to earn Grammy Award nominations in 1982 and 1984 for Best Jazz Performance – Large Group (Instrumental).  John Oddo has become synonymous with the long list of notable Herman composers and arrangers to include names such as Johnny Mandel, Bill Holman, Shorty Rogers, Jimmy Guiffre and others.

"In August 1983, Woody Herman recorded the album My Buddy featuring Rosemary Clooney on the Concord Records label.  Carl Jefferson (CEO with Concord) urged the collaboration as both Clooney and Herman were on contract with his label at the time; this being her eighth and his sixth release with Concord.  John Oddo served as the arranger and musical director of the project having been serving in that role for the Herman band for the previous two and a half years.  Three new arrangements (of Oddo's seven) were literally produced overnight by him for the new project.     The album is the start of a long, 18-year association of Oddo becoming Clooney's musical director; the musical architect of her resurgence in popularity.  His credits include work on 20 of her recordings, as well as numerous live and televised performances.
