He later worked as a paramedic and coal miner before moving to Nashville, Tennessee in 1987. Perry landed a songwriting deal in 1990, and was signed to Curb Records as a recording artist in 1995. Two singles, ""All I Give a Darn About Is You"" and ""I'm Gonna Hurt Her on the Radio"", were released but failed to make the country charts.
