",1,== Biography ==
"Sigurd Hole was born in Elverum, Norway, and has been a vital part of the Norwegian music scene for the past decade, both as part of different jazz ensembles and through his work related to Norwegian folk music. He has been nominated for a Norwegian Grammy twice in recent years.
",2,== Biography ==
"Hole released his first album as a leader, the solo double bass album called ""Elvesang"", in January 2018. Influenced by classical minimalism, his own Norwegian musical heritage and the sound of the Japanese Shakuhachi flute, he explores the double bass as a medium of sound, creating more often than not meditative movements resembling abstract images of different sounds and objects in nature. ""Elvesang"", described by The New York Times as ""An atmospheric solo bass album"", was included in prestigious Best of 2018 lists both in All About Jazz and The New York City Jazz Record. In February 2020 he will release a new solo double bass album called ""Lys / Mørke"". The double album recorded on the arctic islands of Fleinvær in Northern Norway can in many ways be seen as a response to our the climate and ecological crisis, focusing in large on the conscious act of really listening to the natural world - both on a concrete and on a more abstract level. The album will be premiered in Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall on February 3, 2020, as one of the very few solo double bass concerts ever to have been performed at this legendary venue.
",3,== Biography ==
"With drummer Jarle Vespestad and violinist Håkon Aase, Hole formed his own trio (Sigurd Hole Trio) in 2015. The trio released its debut album ""Encounters"" in April 2018, to critical acclaim both in Norway and around the world. Inspired by different traditional music such as the Indian, Middle Eastern and Norwegian folk music, the trio explores elements from these old musical traditions, combining them with their own expressions as improvising musicians of today. The result is a unique mix of eastern and western musical traditions - an open ended, “borderless” form of chamber music described by Jazz Journal UK as being “Finely textured, vividly coloured and rooted in no specific place or time”. The trio has performed at major Norwegian festivals like Bergen International Festival and Varangerfestivalen, and has toured Germany, Belgium, Holland and the US.
