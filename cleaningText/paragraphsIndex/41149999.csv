"In June 2012, RL Grime teamed up with producer Salva for a remix of Kanye West's ""Mercy"", which has garnered over eight million plays on SoundCloud and was called by The Fader ""just massive, as if hail and tsunami waves were both byproducts of bass."" In December 2012, RL Grime remixed Benny Benassi's song ""Satisfaction"", which gained over one million SoundCloud streams and charted in the top five on the Beatport electro house chart. In October 2012, RL Grime released his first Halloween Mix, featuring original songs and remixes of popular tracks, along with vocal drops from celebrities. These mixes have been widely popular, and have continued to drop annually through 2021. Each mix has included vocal cameos from celebrities such as Tony Hawk, Pharrell Williams, Hannibal Buress, Shaquille O'Neal, Guy Fieri, T-Pain, and author R.L. Stine, whose name RL Grime derives from. In July 2013, RL Grime released his High Beams EP on Fool's Gold Records, a five-track EP featuring producer Salva and Los Angeles, California rapper Problem. The EP debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Electronic Chart, and No. 8 on Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums chart. RL Grime collaborated with like-minded producer Baauer on the track ""Infinite Daps"" in November 2013. Both producers toured together throughout July and August 2013, along with Ryan Hemsworth and Jim-E Stack. His debut studio album, Void, was released on November 14, 2014. It featured guest appearances from Big Sean and Boys Noize among others.

"On May 30, 2017, RL Grime announced his second studio album, Nova. The album was released on July 27, 2018, through WeDidIt Records, and featured collaborations with Miguel, Julia Michaels, Chief Keef, Ty Dolla Sign, 24HRS and Joji. The album's lead single, ""I Wanna Know"", was released on March 16, 2018, followed by ""Undo"" on June 13, 2018, and ""Pressure"" on July 11, 2018. Commenting on the album's concept, Henry stated: ""NOVA' came from obsessive ideation on growth and on transition. The art and stories and the moments that inspired me through this record tend to explore this as well. The feeling of leaving behind what was, and of welcoming the foreign. Throughout the process, I had this vision of a 'nova' or of a star no bigger than a person launching from earth into outer space and expanding endlessly until its light was all that we could see. That's the feeling I get from these records, infinite light."" The album's last single, ""Light Me Up"", which featured the vocals of Miguel and Julia Michaels, was released on July 25, 2018. Initially an unused Jack Ü demo which was shown to Grime by Diplo, Grime decided to build the demo out and have Miguel's and Michaels' vocals recut, since he felt that the album required a ""summery vibe"" to it. Henry announced the founding of his record label Sable Valley in February 2019 stating, 'Since the inception of RL Grime, I’ve had this goal in the back of my mind to start my own label. My Halloween mixes have always been an outlet for me to curate and showcase new music, but the natural next step for me was to start a label. My whole life I’ve been obsessed with the process of searching for and finding what's next, and this is a way for me to use platform to highlight emerging talent that I believe in. ""Arcus"" is the first release, and it felt like the perfect son to set the tone for what Sable Valley is about"". In a following statement Sable Valley announced, """"During your membership here at Sable Valley, we strive to provide you with the technical information, advocacy, and professional opportunities to help advance your overall well-being. As a member, you will be able to exchange research information with other Sable Valley affiliates and participate in programming sessions offered at various conferences held by Sable Valley throughout the year""
