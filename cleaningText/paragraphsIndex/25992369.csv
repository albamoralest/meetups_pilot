"Prior to joining The Dillinger Escape Plan, Rymer was the drummer for Long Island-based rock band The Rivalry. After a trial of auditions, guitarist Ben Weinman invited him to Australia to play Soundwave Music Festival, and in early 2009 it was revealed that Rymer would officially replace Gil Sharone as the new drummer. In an interview with Noisey, Weinman said the Dillinger Escape Plan would stop performing, with Greg Puciato later saying ""we're breaking up."" Puciato was quoted saying that the band still enjoyed writing, recording and performing together but ""we started to reach what felt like a thematic conclusion to our band"", comparing the decision to a filmmaker who enjoys the current film he is creating but cannot continue the process indefinitely. Weinman said, ""we are going to do the cycle for this album and that's it.""
