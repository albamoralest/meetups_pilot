"Sugam Pokharel was born in Mangalbare, Morang in 1979. His father was a government scribe in the Department of Land Reform Management, but was also known asan  advocate in the locality. His elder brother Sunil Pokharel is a theater artist. After completion of School Leaving Certificate (Nepal) from Biratnagar, Sugam moved to Kathmandu for his high school education. Initially having no desire to record music as a professional singer or to pursue a career as a pop singer, he decided to record a song when he met Sudin Pokharel in Kathmandu, who was also willing to record the song. They both recorded their first song Ma Maya Garchu at NAAD Studio, Anamnagar in 1995, which was a disaster. After their unsuccessful debut, they came together to record another song four months after their first release. The second release was titled as Payera Timilai Yesto Khusi Chhu. It was not successful. Although facing with two biggest flops in their debut career, their paramount desire of recording hit song didn't halt them to record their third song Panchi. This also didn't do well in the market and the collaboration between Sugam and Sudin ended.
