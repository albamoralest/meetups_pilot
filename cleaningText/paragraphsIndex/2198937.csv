"Chapter 4: Labor Pains was released on January 13, 2009. In 2009, Johnson appeared on a single with KRS-One, Twista and Crucial Conflict entitled ""Self Destruction"". According to Grant Parks and Coalmine Music, artists lent their lyrics for a cause they believe in with the statement ""The time is now as we approach the holidays and a new year; it will give us all something to think about and reflect on loved ones that lost their life to senseless violent acts.""Steve Jones of USA Today gave Chapter 4: Labor Pains 3.5/4 stating ""Despite critical acclaim for her ongoing personal chronicles that began with 2001's Chapter 1: Love, Pain & Forgiveness, the soulful Chicago native never found a mainstream niche. Unfairly, she's best known for Kanye West's All Falls Down. Here, with her gorgeous voice and evocative storytelling, she continues to offer some of the decade's most stirring R&B.""
