"Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania as the youngest of three children. Born to middle class parents, Mann lived with his mother in Philadelphia’s inner city after his parents’ divorce. From early childhood, he began experimenting with songwriting and taught himself guitar, piano, bass, harmonica, baritone horn and flute. By age 12, Mann had put together several bands with other young local musicians, including musicians such as Steven Wolf, Clayton Sears and Adam Dorn (a.k.a. Mocean Worker). Mann attended the Philadelphia High School for the Creative & Performing Arts (CAPA) for Vocal Music, alongside members of Boyz II Men, The Roots, Christian McBride and Joey DeFrancesco, receiving his diploma in three years. Three years after high school, in 1989 he received his bachelor’s degree from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts.

"Mann began his professional career by living in a car for nearly two years as a traveling musician. After stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and London, Mann landed in New York, where a chance encounter with producer Ric Wake, put together by songwriter/performer Gregg Wattenberg,  saw Wake introduce Mann to then A&M Records label head, Al Cafaro; Mann was ultimately signed to Wake for publishing, to Wake’s production company, and to Wake’s imprint DV8 Records, distributed by A&M. The deal led to two solo releases: 1996’s Billy Mann and 1998’s Earthbound. Inspired by the loss of his first wife Rema Hort Mann, to stomach cancer nine months after they were married, Earthbound was co-produced by Mann and David Kershenbaum and featured co-writes with and an appearance by early mentor Carole King.
