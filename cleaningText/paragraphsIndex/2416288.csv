She starred in popular wartime films including Die schwedische Nachtigall (""The Swedish Nightingale""), Wir machen Musik (""We're Making Music""), the musical drama Große Freiheit Nr. 7 and Münchhausen.

"Having briefly been barred from performing by the Allies at the end of World War II, due to her alleged role in Nazi propaganda, she returned to the big screen in the 1950s where she excelled in dramatic character roles. She also acted in theatre, worked as a dubbing actor, and recorded numerous songs and whistling performances.
