"The group was formed primarily to play a battle of the bands at the local Queens Village church Our Lady of Lourdes in 1988.  Most songs were jokes and paid tribute to the legendary local bands Norman Bates and the Showerheads and Six and Violence.   After a surprising turnout and mass appeal they decided to continue to play locally and record demo tapes and 7-inch records.  At this point they acquired drummer Vinnie Value, second vocalist Mike Dixon and bassist Scott Cumbo to replace the members who left the original line-up. No Redeeming Social Value had a run on the local Queens Heavy Metal circuit in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Eventually, with the help of the Lower East Side band Warzone (band) and local punk DJ Johnny Stiff, they began to play many hardcore punk matinee shows in Manhattan. The band's first LP release Rocks the Party on SFT Records led to opportunities for national and international tours. No Redeeming Social Value currently plays shows sporadically throughout the year.
