"Christopher Gabriel Nelson is an American rock musician from Sacramento, California, best known as the former bassist of the alternative rock band CAKE. Nelson replaced the original CAKE bassist, Shon Meckfessel, soon after the band was formed but left the band himself before the release of their first album, Motorcade of Generosity, which lists Victor Damiani as bassist. After the release of CAKE's second album, Fashion Nugget, Damiani left and Nelson re-joined. After playing bass and helping co-write songs on CAKE's subsequent studio albums, Nelson left the band again in late 2015.
