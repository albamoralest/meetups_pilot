"Johnston was a session musician and Melcher had a minor solo career as ""Terry Day"" before becoming the youngest staff record producer in Columbia Records' history. In 1963, they began recording together and helped produce the album Surfin' Round the World. While producing a ""surf-frat"" band called the Rip Chords, whose ""Here I Stand"" had reached No. 51 in early 1963, they ended up vocal arranging and singing all of the vocal parts on the band's hit ""Hey Little Cobra"" in 1964. The song was the first in a series of hit singles (most of which were released under the name Bruce & Terry), reaching No. 4 on the U.S. pop charts. The duo virtually disbanded when Johnston joined The Beach Boys, singing on Pet Sounds and performing with them well into the 21st century, while Melcher became a full-time producer. The two occasionally worked on projects together until Melcher died at 62, after a long battle with melanoma, on November 19, 2004.
