"Forro in the Dark is a New York City-based group of Brazilian musicians who play a modern update on forró, a traditional music that originates from the Northeast of Brazil On October 16, 2002 (Refosco's birthday), he invited some friends over for a forró-style jam session at Nublu, a nightclub located in the East Village district of New York City. The group was such a hit that they started a weekly residency at the club. Their public prominence increased due to their extended residency at Nublu, where they came into contact with prominent New York influence David Byrne, who helped propel further recognition for the band when they collaborated on Forro in the Dark's 2006 album Bonfires of São João. The band have released two albums and one EP so far including 2006's Bonfires of São João, 2008's Dia de Roda EP and 2009's Light a Candle.
