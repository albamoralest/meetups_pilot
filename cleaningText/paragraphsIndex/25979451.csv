"Jaspinder's career in singing began early. Her father Kesar Singh Narula was a music composer of the 1950s. She took her music training under the worthy tutelage of her father Shri Kesar Singh Narula and later from Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan of Rampur Sahaswan Gharana. Initially, Jaspindar Narula kept away from film singing and specialised in singing bhajans and Sufiana compositions. She moved to Mumbai a few years later at the advice of noted music director Kalyanji who heard her at the private gathering in Delhi and asked his son and music director, Viju Shah, to give her break in films like Master, Aar Ya Paar and Bade Miyan Chhote Miyan (1998). She excels in singing folk and devotional songs. She has lent her voice to record numerous music albums for a large number of successful Bollywood films like Dulhe Raja, Virasat, Mission Kashmir, Mohabbatein and Bunty aur Babli to name a few.
