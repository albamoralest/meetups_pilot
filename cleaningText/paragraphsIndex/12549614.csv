"Repetition and change are central motifs in Nik Bärtsch's music and performance practice. Nik Bärtsch's work is at the intersection of contemporary music, jazz and funk influences. The use of repetition, as well as structures based on interweaving elements in his music suggests the influence of minimalist music, and in particular of Steve Reich. Bärtsch is also influenced by oriental philosophy and the ostinato of James Brown. He has also taken a close interest in the work of the American composers John Cage and Morton Feldman. Bärtsch is fascinated by the Japanese Zen culture. His musical attitude is also influenced by his interest in the Japanese martial art (Aikido) and Zen, among other things. It is his Zen practice of awareness that does not get lost in the multiple, but reduces the multiple as much as possible and concentrates on the essential. For all the diversity of its influences, this music always reveals its own signature. Although elements from a wide variety of musical worlds have found their way into it - from funk and jazz to new classical music and the sounds of Japanese ritual music - these forms are not juxtaposed or quoted in a postmodern way, but rather merge to form a new style. The result is a grooving, tonally and rhythmically highly differentiated music, composed of a few phrases and motifs that are combined and overlaid in ever new and varied ways. At the European jazz competition of the german Leverkusen Jazztage in 1995, Bärtsch reached the finals with Menico Ferrari's band Groove Cooperative. In 1999 and 2002 he was awarded the UBS Culture Foundation Promotion Prize. In 2002 he was awarded the Werkjahr of the Swiss city of Zurich. In 2004 he received the culture prize of the municipality of Zollikon (recognition prize). In 2007 he received a composition commission from Pro Helvetia for a music and dance program with Hideto Heshiki. Bärtsch was simultaneously supported by Pro Helvetia as part of the Priority Jazz Promotion 2007-2009. In 2015 he was nominated for the Swiss Music Prize of the Federal Office of Culture.  In 2016 he won the category ""Rising Stars Keyboards"" of DownBeat magazine. In 2019 he received the Art Prize of the City of Zurich. In 2021 he won an award from DownBeat magazine for the second time, this time in the ""Critics Poll"" in the category ""Rising star piano"" piano"". These awards are among the most important prizes in the jazz world.
