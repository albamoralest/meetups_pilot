"Patki was born on 25 August 1941 to a Maharashtrian family in Mumbai. He completed his secondary schooling in Gopi Tank Municipal school and is followed by a sister and two brothers. With his growing interest in music, Patki did not show much interest in schooling and decided not to complete his college education. In 2012, Patki wrote a book about his career named as ""Saptasur Majhe"" (""My Seven Notes""). The book was written in Marathi language and was launched by Manovikas Prakashan. Though Patki did not receive any formal training in music, in August 2013, he started a music school in Pune named as ""Sanchari Gurukul"", mainly focusing on light and semi-classical Hindustani music, better known as ""Sugam Sangeet"". Patki noted that the school ""aims at bringing back the traditional guru-shishya parampara (master-pupil tradition) in teaching music.""
