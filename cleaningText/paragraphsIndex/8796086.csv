"Tim Feehan graduated from the University of Alberta in 1980 and began his recording/songwriting career quite accidentally when his college band ""Footloose"" was asked by a local studio owner to record a song he'd written.  That song, ""Leaving for Maui"", was a Top Ten hit in Hawaii. In 1986, Feehan entered a songwriting contest sponsored by producer David Foster (Celine Dion, Whitney Houston) taking first place and signed with Scotti Bros/CBS in Los Angeles where he relocated later that year.  The self-titled debut album Tim Feehan was released in 1987 and gained five A.R.I.A. (Alberta Recording Industry Association) awards including ""Best Pop Performance"" and ""Producer of the Year"".  The first single ""Where's the Fire"" was chosen as the theme song for the Charlie Sheen motion picture and cult favorite The Wraith.  In 1987, Tim also won the Canadian Academy of Arts & Sciences Juno Award for ""Most Promising Male Vocalist"". In the late 1980s, Feehan signed with MCA records and released Full Contact, which featured collaborations with songwriters Bruce Gaitsch (""La Isla Bonita"" Madonna), Gene Black (""Never"" Heart), and Marc Jordan (""Rhythm of My Heart"" Rod Stewart).  Musicians included American Idol judge Randy Jackson of Journey, Steve Lukather (Toto), Timothy B. Schmit (Eagles), and Richard Marx.  During the down time, Tim sang and produced ""Dirty Love"" which appeared in the James Bond film Licence to Kill and performed on both the Arthur 2: On the Rocks theme and the Dionne Warwick gold album Reservations for Two.  Feehan wrote ""Heart in Pieces"" for the million selling album Chicago 19 and performed in the video Stop the Madness alongside Whitney Houston for the Nancy Reagan anti-drug campaign ""Just Say No"".

"In 1987, Feehan was lead singer in the David Foster All-Star World Tour featuring Lee Ritenour (guitar), Nathan East (bass) and Vinnie Colaiuta (drums).  In 1993, Tim co-purchased the ""Backroom"" recording studio in Glendale, California.  In 1996, Feehan released the album Pray for Rain, and co-wrote and produced the critically acclaimed ""The Color of Silence"" for quadruple platinum selling teen pop star Tiffany.

"On August 27, 1989, Feehan's song, ""Memories Will Last Forever"", was played when the Edmonton Oilers honoured Wayne Gretzky with the unveiling of his bronze statue. This song was also used for Wayne Gretzky's retirement jersey ceremony on October 1, 1999 in Edmonton, Alberta.
