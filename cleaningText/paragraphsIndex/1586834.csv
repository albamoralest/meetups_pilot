"In the mid-1970s, Houben attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston. When he returned to Belgium, he established the jazz seminar at the Liège conservatory, in association with Henri Pousseur. In his long career he played with Joe Newman, Bill Frisell, Toots Thielemans, Chet Baker, Mike Stern, George Coleman, and Gerry Mulligan. He won the Belgian Golden Django in 2000 for best Belgian artist (first winner of the new category).

He also appeared on her first album, ""A Stomach is Burning"". He currently teaches jazz saxophone at the Brussels conservatory.
