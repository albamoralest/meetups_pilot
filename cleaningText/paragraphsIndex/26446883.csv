"Together with brother Pat, Lolly led a band called The Avantis. The ensemble also consisted of drummer Mike Kowalski and guitarist Danny Hamilton. They became a support act for the Beach Boys. The Avantis did some work with Judd Hamilton (older brother of Dan Hamilton) who was the arranger and co-composer on their records. In 1963 The Avantis had a minor hit with ""Wax 'Em Down"".  The single was distributed in Canada by Sparton of Canada Ltd where it made the charts. On October 12, 1963, Canada's C-FUNTASTIC FIFTY recorded the single's chart status as having moved up one notch from the previous week's position of 36 to 37, putting it right behind ""Fools Rush In"" by Rick Nelson. Vegas co-wrote the Rick Lancelot & The Peppermint Sticks single ""Sick Chick"" / ""Ain't That Soul"" which was released in 1964. Rick Lancelot was in fact Ricky Lancelotti. Vegas also wrote ""Love Will Make You Crawl"" for Cliff Wagner which was the B-side to his 1966 single, ""Exception to the Rule"". In 1969, along with his brother Pat, rhythm guitarist Tony Bellamy and drummer Pete DePoe he formed the band Redbone, for which he was the lead singer. The band produced the singles ""Maggie"", ""The Witch Queen of New Orleans"", and their biggest hit ""Come and Get Your Love"".
