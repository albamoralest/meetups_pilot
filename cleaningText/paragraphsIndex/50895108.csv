"Besides the tenor saxophone Laurillard also studied the piano and percussion. Between 1959 and 1972 he worked as a semi-professional saxophonist and arranger for various rock and roll and rhythm and blues groups and big bands in Vancouver. The soul group the Accents (1962–1967) was the most prominent of them. At the University of British Columbia, he completed his studies in mechanical engineering, but did not pursue a career in that field.

"In 1972 he settled in Amsterdam, where he found a job as a carpenter and studio manager at the Oktopus cultural center. There he organized his first workshops. He founded his Elastiek Band and worked with organist Herbert Noord, with whom he debuted on an album in 1976.

"A year earlier, Laurillard had moved to the Dutch village of Eenrum. In the nearby city of Groningen, during sessions at a bar, he met local free improvising musicians like pianist Ko de Regt, bassist Gwan Kwee and multi-instrumentalist and performer Harry de Wit.
",6,== 1970s ==
"He took courses with Herman Schoonderwalt, Misha Mengelberg and Han Bennink, and formed in 1978 with pianist Robert Rettich the Super Jazz Quartet, which occurred frequently in local establishments. In the same period, he began to organize diverse workshop orchestras.

"Inspired by the performances of upcoming free funk bands from the United States at the Groninger Jazzmarathon, Laurillard founded in 1981 the Noodband, a double trio with two saxophonists, two bassists and two drummers. That ensemble gained international fame when voice artist Greetje Bijma joined the sextet. They performed at festivals throughout Europe. The Noodband produced two albums and can be considered as Laurillard's most successful project.
