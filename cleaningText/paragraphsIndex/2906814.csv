"Lundstrem was born to a family of musicians in Chita, Transbaikal Oblast. His family moved to Harbin, China, when he was five. In 1935, inspired by Duke Ellington's ""Dear Old Southland"" record which he occasionally purchased in Harbin for a private party, Lundstrem joined forces with eight other young Russian amateur musicians and formed the Oleg Lundstrem Orchestra. In 1936, the band moved to Shanghai, where they immediately became popular among the public. Until 1947, the band was an important part of Shanghai jazz scene, along with Buck Clayton Orchestra.
