"The singles Lastima and La Luna written together with bandmember Bendik Gjevjon gained high rotation on nearly all Norwegian radio stations including NRK P3 for over a year.

With the following single All For You and the album Fat Sound To The Masses, Doctor No signs a new deal with Warner Music Japan, and many other territories follows up the releases in 2001. In 2002 Isak started the new project Disco Valente released on Nice & Firm/Bonnier Music Norway.

The single is compiled in excess of 750,000 units and was also included on all Samsung mobile phones in the years after. Isak Rypdal is currently working with the band Electro Spectre, and the current album Dangerous Game was suggested as the best electro pop album for 2012 by Side-Line Magazine.
