"Though electronica has typically been a producer's medium (and the few vocalists who succeed are usually women), Robert Owens became one of the people associated with the late-1980s golden era of Chicago house. Born in Ohio, United States, Robert Owens grew up singing in church, but years later, he was working as a DJ in 1985, when he met Chicago producer Larry Heard. The pair formed Fingers Inc., along with Ron Wilson, and they released a few singles (""You're Mine""/""It's Over"") plus the 1988 album, Another Side. The group disbanded quickly, as Heard's burgeoning solo-production career (as Mr. Fingers) took priority. Owens had already released recordings on his own - ""Bring Down the Walls"" and ""I'm Strong"" made for Alleviated (with production from Heard), and he signed a solo contract with 4th & B'way Records. His 1990 album Rhythms in Me lost visibility soon after within the quickly disintegrating Chicago house scene. (One of his best-known features of the late 1980s, ""Tears"",  appeared with the names of Frankie Knuckles and producer Satoshi Tomiie.)By 1996, he had returned to dance music with ""Ordinary People"": a two-part EP recording for Musical Directions. He joined up with Tomiie (again) and Cevin Fisher in 1999, to make a track from Tomiie's Full Lick LP. One year later, in 2000, Owens appeared on the Photek hit ""Mine to Give"". In 2003, he joined with drum and bass act London Elektricity to provide the vocals for their album Billion Dollar Gravy.
