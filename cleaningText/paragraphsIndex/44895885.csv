"2012 and 2013 were considered relatively successful period for Nan, as his digital single Cheers 為執著乾杯, released in 2012 summer, received his first ever number-one in the music charts (903 and TVB). The song encouraged positive thinking and more importantly highlighted his challenges against all the criticisms through his musical career. The song was even used as one theme song in the September protests against Moral and national education after release. Besides, retro electro You Are So London, I Am So New York 你倫敦，我紐約 and piano based Let's go to Alaska 一起去阿拉斯加 also went top of the charts.
