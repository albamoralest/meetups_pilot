"McMorrow's debut album, Early in the Morning, was released in Ireland in February 2010, and in the United States and Europe in 2011, to widespread acclaim. He made his UK television debut on BBC Two's Later... with Jools Holland on 27 May 2011. He played with Lisa Hannigan on 8 December 2011 at Dublin's Button Factory for the Choice Music Prize event. In 2011, he co-wrote the song ""Shells of Silver"" with Northern Irish electronic group The Japanese Popstars, and his vocals are featured. The song is featured in Season 5, Episode 7 of the CW teen drama Gossip Girl. In 2014, he released his second album, Post Tropical, which included the song ""Glacier"". The song was used in the 2014 Spanish Christmas Lottery advertising campaign. The album was recorded in 2013 in the small desert town of Tornillo, 89 kilometres (55 mi) south of El Paso in Texas. The studio is located on a pecan farm, and McMorrow found the location ""the most surreal place to work"", and one that helped add to the tone of the album and inspire his creativity. He said ""I think it's kind of engrained in the record, more than any pinpointed thing. I can hear the hot bedded air in this part. You can hear the birds in the pianos.""In 2015, he composed a film score for the short, ""Martha"", directed by Sam Benenati. In 2016, his cover of the Chris Isaak song ""Wicked Game"" was used in the first official full-length trailer for the sixth season of the HBO hit series Game of Thrones.
