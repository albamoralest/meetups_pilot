"He signed his first record contract with a major label at age 18. Falcon, a prolific writer, considers himself a ""reporter"" of his life experiences in lyrics and melodies. Pretty Blue World, released in 1991, produced Falcon's highest-charting single, ""Power Windows"", which broke into the Top 40. The same album contains ""Heavenâ€™s Highest Hill"", which articulates the pain of having to tell his three-year-old daughter that her mother had died, echoing the true-life event of the loss of his wife Myla to breast cancer.

"He signed a deal with Mercury Records after Jon Bon Jovi contacted him about working together in the early 1990s. Falcon has co-written over thirty songs on several Bon Jovi albums. ""Give in to Me"", co-written with Falcon's daughter Rose and Elisha Hoffman, is featured in the Sony Pictures film Country Strong and performed by Faith Hill on the film's soundtrack. Other songs he has written have been covered by Stevie Nicks, Cher, Manfred Mann, Sherrie Austin, Meat Loaf and Trace Adkins. Over his career, Falcon has released more than a dozen albums.
