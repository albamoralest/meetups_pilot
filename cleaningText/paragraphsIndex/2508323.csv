"Born on April 23, 1981 in Zvornik, Aleksić started performing in kafanas and discothèques from an early age due to struggling financial situation in her family. After winning at the folk music festival Moravski biseri in Ćuprija, she was signed to Grand Production under which she released her debut album Idealno tvoja in 2002. The following years, she gained further popularity with her next albums, Balkan (2003) and Dođi i uzmi me (2005), and hits like ""Crno i zlatno"", which also became her signature song. Her fourth album, titled Kraljica, was sold in 300,000 copies, making Aleksić the best-selling Serbian artist that year. After releasing her fifth album Slučajni partneri, she performed in the Belgrade Arena in October 2010. Seka held another concert in the Arena in April 2018, which succeeded albums Lek za spavanje (2015) and Koma (2017) released through City Records.
