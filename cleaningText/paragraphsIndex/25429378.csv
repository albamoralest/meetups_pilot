In 2014, they signed to punk label Don Giovanni records and announced they would be working on a new album produced by Marissa Paternoster of the band Screaming Females. After the Don Giovanni release of You Look a Lot Like Me in 2015, Blum began touring nationally as a band with a bassist and drummer, contributing to what critics called a ""more developed but still gritty, punk"" sound.

"In February 2019 Blum released a new single, ""Things Still Left To Say,"" and in March 2019 they toured with Lucy Dacus. That year they released the album Pity Boy,  recorded with Joe Reinhart of Hop Along at Headroom Studios in Philadelphia. Pitchfork's Abby Jones categorized Pity Boy as a shift ""into potent pop-punk that recalls both Hop Along and Titus Andronicus."" noting the newfound focus on guitarist Audrey Zee Whitesides' electric riffs, while maintaining the lyrics as ""the album's centerpiece"" writes Jones, If the electric guitar had evolved into a supporting actor by Blum’s last album, 2016’s You Look a Lot Like Me, then it’s the lead on Pity Boy. The nimble, vigorous riffs [...] ricocheting like rubber balls around “I Don’t Want To” and “Not My Job” with Blum’s vocals surging in countermelody.

" It’s punk in spirit, but the production is rich and warm, wrapping the power chords and solos in a sunny, welcoming fuzz. At their best, as on the jangly opener “Things Still Left to Say,” they sound like The Buzzcocks, if The Buzzcocks opted for compassion instead of bile.
