"Dibb was born on January 6, 1978, in Orange, California to Jessica B Mendlovitz and David C Dibb, who married in 1977. He began writing and recording music with childhood friend Noah Lennox (Panda Bear) in 1991.  While at The Park School of Baltimore, Josh met David Portner (Avey Tare) and Brian Weitz (Geologist) when they asked him to join their band, Automine.  Josh introduced Noah to Dave and Brian and over the next few years the four spent time playing music together and sharing tapes of music they made individually. After high school, Panda Bear and Deakin went to Boston, where Deakin attended Brandeis University.  Avey Tare and Geologist moved to New York City to attend NYU and Columbia University respectively.  After months of playing the band finally settled on the name ""Animal Collective"". After touring with the group from 2004 to the end of 2006 and recording two albums, Feels and Strawberry Jam, the Water Curses EP and the visual album ODDSAC he decided to take a break from the increasingly rigorous touring schedule. After not participating in the recording of the album Merriweather Post Pavilion, he rejoined the band live on April 10, 2011 in Petaluma, California after a three-year absence.
