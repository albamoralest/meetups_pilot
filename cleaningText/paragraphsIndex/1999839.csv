"After graduating high school in the 70s, Riley moved to Los Angeles to pursue a music career. In 1979, he joined a revival of Steppenwolf, but the lineup broke up later that year. In 1985, Riley joined W.A.S.P., and performed on The Last Command and Inside the Electric Circus, as well as the live album Live...In the Raw. Riley left the band to join L.A. Guns in 1987, as part of the band's ""classic"" lineup alongside guitarists Tracii Guns and Mick Cripps, vocalist Phil Lewis and bassist Kelly Nickels. He appeared on the albums Cocked & Loaded, and Hollywood Vampires.

"Riley was fired from the band in 1992. He returned in 1995. In 2006, there were two L.A. Guns lineups, Phil Lewis's and Tracii Guns's. Riley was a member of Lewis's lineup until it folded in 2016 when merging with Guns's version. Subsequently, Riley created his own version of L.A. Guns in 2019.  This version released an album, Renegades, through Golden Robot records.  Following lawsuits over the band name, a settlement was reach in April 2021, allowing this band to continue as Riley's L.A. Guns.
