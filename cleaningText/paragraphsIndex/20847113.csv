"Paredes' most prominent solo work, Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo, became the anthem of the peaceful 1986 People Power Revolution that overthrew the regime of Ferdinand Marcos. It was participated in by 15 Filipino artists in April of that year, and its English version ""A New and Better Way"" was launched in Australia a few months after. In recognition of its significance, the lyrics of the song are embedded on a wall of the Our Lady of EDSA Shrine, the Roman Catholic chapel sanctifying the 1986 Revolution.
