"Arthur Jones  (1940 – 1998)   was an American Free Jazz alto saxophonist known for his highly  energetic but  warm  tones. Jones was born in Cleveland, USA, and played for several years in a Rock and Roll band. After discovering  music by Ornette Coleman and  Eric Dolphy, he started appearing  on  the New York scene, playing  in Frank Wright's group where he took part in  the recording  of the  Your Prayer (1967) album. He then also  worked with Jacques Coursil.  In 1968 he was a member of  Sunny Murray's Acoustical Swing Unit, with  which  he went  to  Paris in  1969 and where he recorded two  albums of  Africanasia as leader   with  most  of the musicians from the  Art Ensemble of Chicago. He also  made numerous other recordings for  BYG Actuel, with Coursil, Archie Shepp, Sunny Murray or Burton Greene. He died in New York City, USA.
