"Ballaké's father, Djelimady Sissoko, was a notable musician from the Gambia in his own right who moved to Mali and was funded by the government to be part of the national orchestra. Sissoko started playing music at a young age, as most born into the jeli or griot caste do. In 1981, when he was 13, Sissoko's father died, and he took his father's place within the Ensemble Instrumental National du Mali. He also performed with several prominent female singers before coming to fame through his duet with Toumani Diabaté in 1999. In 2000, he formed the trio Mande Tabolo with an n'goni player and a balafon player.

",6,== The Broken Kora affair ==
"On returning from a 2020 US tour, Sissoko checked in his €5000 custom-made kora at the airport in New York for the flight back to Paris. On his arrival he discovered that the instrument had been dismantled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. According to Sissoko's manager, Corinne Serres, ""Even if all the components that had been dismantled remained intact, it would take weeks for a kora of this calibre to return to its former state of resonance."". The customs agency, however, denied opening the kora case which should not have triggered an alarm in the security scanners. Sissoko's 2021 album Djourou, also released by No Format, takes its name from these events.
