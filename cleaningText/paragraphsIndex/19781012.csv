Born in Neah Bay, Washington in 1943, his tribal Ancestors are Southern Cheyenne, Turtle Mountain Chippewa, and Rogue River/Siletz. DePoe is also of French and German descent. He first played with Jimi Hendrix in Seattle's local taverns as a young man and then moved to California and became Redbone's drummer in 1969.

"He was credited with developing a style of drumming known as ""King Kong"", later copied by other drummers for its versatile and funk-oriented rhythms. In early 1972, he left the group. The band replaced him with Arturo Perez, and then with Redbone bandmate Tony Bellamy's Filipino-Mexican American cousin, Butch Rillera.
