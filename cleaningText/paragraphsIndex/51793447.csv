"McCaddon's career started in 1994 when he joined the band Embodyment. They released their debut album, Embrace the Eternal, in 1997; it featured guest vocals by Living Sacrifice vocalist Bruce Fitzhugh. Embrace the Eternal would later be re-released by their record label, Solid State Records. He left the band in 2000 before recording their second album, The Narrow Scope of Things. McCaddon started the band, along with Joshua Ashworth, Rob Pruett, Joel Bailey, and Chad Wilburn, Society's Finest. In 2000 they released an EP titled Private Conflicts & Suicides. Their debut album, The Journey...So Far, was released on Solid State Records in May 2000. In 2003 they took a short break, during which McCaddon decided to leave Society's Finest, and went on to join Demon Hunter. After leaving Society's Finest and Embodyment, Ryan Clark and Don Clark, formerly of Training for Utopia, recruited him, Jesse Sprinkle, formerly of Poor Old Lu, and Jon Dunn (Who would later join Soul Embraced) to join their project, Demon Hunter. Demon Hunter already had an album before he joined. On this album McCaddon had contributed by photography. On his Demon Hunter debut, Summer of Darkness, was great success. In 2005, Ethan Luck, formerly of The O.C. Supertones and Project 86, replaced McCaddon. In 2006, former Embodyment members, Mark Garza (drums) and Andrew Godwin (guitar), contacted McCaddon and said they wanted to play metal again. McCaddon contacted former Society's Finest member, Nick Nowell (bass) and asked him to join their new project, The Famine. Though McCaddon knew people would compare the Famine to Embodyment, he stated that ""We started The Famine because we wanted to get away from the stuff we were playing with Embodyment..."". In 2007, they signed to Solid State Records and released their debut EP, The Famine. In 2008, they released their debut album, The Raven and the Reaping. In 2010, McCaddon departed The Famine and Nick Nowell took over vocals. The Famine later broke-up in 2011. McCaddon is a former employee of Takehold Records and Tooth & Nail Records.
