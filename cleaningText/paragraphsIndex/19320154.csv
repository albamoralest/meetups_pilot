"Max Creek was formed in 1971. In 1972, founding member Dave Reed invited one of his music students, 15-year-old Scott Murawski, to sit in with the band. Scott's early original association with the band ended abruptly when he was banned from a club that the band played at regularly for drinking a beer. Months later, Mark Mercier was added to the lineup on keyboards and Scott was invited back to play guitar. Eventually, Dave left the band to pursue country rock and acoustic ragtime music, cementing Murawski as the band's permanent lead guitarist. Murawski is a long-time collaborator and member of Phish bassist Mike Gordon's solo band, and BK3, a trio led by Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann.
