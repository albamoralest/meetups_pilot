"Born in Compiègne, Chrétien was appointed professor at the Paris Conservatoire in 1889 where she had previously been a student from 1874, studying with Ernest Guiraud. In 1881, she won  first prize in harmony, counterpoint and fugue. She also won first prize in piano and in composition in other concours, which she entered. She was a prolific composer, yet not much else is known about her life. Her compositions, about 150 in all, consist of  pieces for piano, orchestral and chamber works, songs,  two ballets  and two one-act operas. One of the most extensive collections of her work in the United States is held in the University of Michigan's Women Composers Collection, which is available on microfilm from there and other libraries.
