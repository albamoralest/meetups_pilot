"In 1983, Somerville co-founded the synthpop group Bronski Beat, which had several hits in the British charts. Their biggest hit was ""Smalltown Boy"", which reached No. 3 in the UK charts. In the music video Somerville plays the song's titular character, who leaves his hostile hometown for the friendlier city, reflecting Somerville's own experiences when he moved to London. Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985 and formed The Communards with classically trained pianist Richard Coles, now a Church of England vicar and broadcaster. They had several hits, including a cover version of Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes' ""Don't Leave Me This Way"", which spent four weeks at No. 1 in the UK charts and became the biggest-selling single of 1986 in the UK. He also sang backing vocals on Fine Young Cannibals' version of ""Suspicious Minds"", which was a UK Top 10 hit.

"The Communards split in 1988; Somerville began a solo career the following year. He released his debut solo album Read My Lips in November 1989, which contained three UK Top 30 hits, including a hit cover of Sylvester's disco classic ""You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)"" and a cover of ""Comment te dire adieu?"", a duet with June Miles-Kingston, which reached number 14 in the UK Singles chart. He also sang on the second Band Aid project at the end of 1989.

"In November 1990, Somerville's greatest-hits album The Singles Collection 1984/1990 (which featured his hits with Bronski Beat and The Communards in addition to his own material) was released; it reached number 4 on the UK Album Chart. It included a reggae cover of the Bee Gees' hit song ""To Love Somebody"", which also reached the UK Top 10. Also in 1990, Somerville contributed the song ""From This Moment On"" to the Cole Porter tribute album Red Hot + Blue produced by the Red Hot Organization, the proceeds from which benefited AIDS research.

"In 1991, Somerville provided backing vocals to a track called ""Why Aren't You in Love With Me?"" from the album Ripe by Communards offshoot band Banderas. The Banderas duo, Caroline Buckley and Sally Herbert, had previously been part of Somerville's backing band. After this, he disappeared from the limelight for several years. He returned in 1995 with the album Dare to Love, which included ""Heartbeat"" (a UK Top 30 hit and a No. 1 hit on the US dance chart), ""Hurt So Good"" and ""By Your Side"", though commercial success was now beginning to elude him and his contract with London Records to which he had been signed for over a decade came to an end.

"A new single, ""Dark Sky"", was released in 1997 and peaked at No. 66 in the UK. In the same year he provided vocals on The Number One Song in Heaven for the Sparks album Plagiarism with production by Tony Visconti. His third album, entitled Manage The Damage, was released in 1999 via Gut Records, but failed to chart. A companion remix album, Root Beer, came out in 2000. His dance-orientated fourth solo album, Home Again, was released in 2004, again not charting.

The album was initially only available as a digital download but in May 2010 was made available in a limited edition (3,000 copies) CD/DVD in the UK. In late 2010, Somerville released a dance EP called Bright Thing.

"Somerville released a disco-inspired album called Homage in 2014. Singles were ""Back to Me"" followed by ""Travesty"". The emphasis in recording the album was on achieving the musical authenticity of original disco which Somerville grew up listening to. He stated: ""I've finally made the disco album I always wanted to and never thought I could.""He has also had an acting career, appearing in Sally Potter's 1992 film of Virginia Woolf's Orlando, in Isaac Julien's 1989 Looking for Langston, and in an episode of the cult science fiction television series Lexx (""Girltown""). In February 2021, Somerville teamed up with producer Sally Herbert (formerly of 1990s duo Banderas and also part of The Communards' backing band) to record a cover of ""Everything Must Change"" by Nina Simone as a charity record for End Youth Homelessness, a network of projects which includes Centrepoint in London and a number of other homeless charity organisations around the UK.
