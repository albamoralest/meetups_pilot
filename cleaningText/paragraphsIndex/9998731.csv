"Adalberto's relaxed and flawless lead vocals are among the best in the salsa genre of Latin music. His early influences included the great Cuban vocalists Beny Moré and Miguelito Cuní. Santiago started his professional career singing with trios and playing guitar and bass. After stints with the bands of Chuíto Vélez, where he was called ""The Puerto Rican Elvis Presley"", Willie Rosario and Willie Rodriguez, his career reached new heights when he joined Ray Barretto's band. Between 1966 and 1972, Adalberto made seven studio albums with Ray Barretto, that contained hit songs like ""Quitate La Mascara"" and ""Alma Con Alma"". During this time period he also became an original founding member of the salsa ""super-group"" The Fania All-Stars. In late 1972, Adalberto and four other members of Barretto's band departed to found Típica 73. He appeared on three of their albums before disagreement over musical direction led him, and three other band members, to split during the mid-1970s to form Los Kimbos. Santiago sang lead vocals on charanga albums, Fantasía Africana/African Fantasy and Our Heritage - Nuestra Herencia, by flautist, composer and producer Lou Pérez. Los Kimbos had a similar sound to both the pre-split Ray Barretto and Típica 73 outfits. With Los Kimbos, Adalberto recorded Los Kimbos (1976) and The Big Kimbos With Adalberto Santiago (1977). That year he also made his solo debut on Adalberto, which was produced by Barretto. Los Kimbos continued under the leadership of Orestes Vilató. Santiago sang lead on one track on Louie Ramírez y Sus Amigos by Louie Ramírez. In 1979, Adalberto and Ramírez co-produced his solo follow-up, Adalberto Featuring Popeye El Marino. The same year, he reunited with Barretto on Rican/Struction. Barretto produced Adalberto's next solo album, Feliz Me Siento (1980). Sonora Matancera member, Javier Vázquez, produced, arranged, directed and played piano on Adalberto Santiago, which was Adalberto's contribution to the early 1980s típico salsa revival. In 1982, Santiago joined with Roberto Roena for Super Apollo 47:50. Santiago then co-produced Calidad with Papo Lucca, who also played piano, and oversaw musical direction. His Cosas Del Alma was an album of boleros which included his third recorded version of ""Alma Con Alma"" (which was previously contained on Barretto's The Message and Gracias ), and featured arrangements made by Tito Puente, Ray Santos and Alberto Naranjo, among others. He returned to alsa in 1985 on Más Sabroso. Adalberto did his own version of salsa romántica on Sex Symbol, with production, arrangements, musical direction and piano by Isidro Infante. This album produced one of Santiago's biggest solo hit songs ""La Noche Mas Linda Del Mundo"". In 1990, he again performed ""Alma Con Alma"", this time arranged by Infante in a salsa romántica style for Louie Ramírez's second album entitled Louie Ramírez y Sus Amigos. Santiago has written songs for a number of the albums on which he has appeared, both as lead singer and solo artist, and provided compositions for other artists to record, such as Joe Cuba. He has appeared in Robin Williams's movie Moscow on the Hudson, and provided music for Al Pacino's Carlito's Way as well as appearing as himself in the film Our Latin Thing.

"Adalberto, now in his 80s, continues to record and perform in the US, Europe and South America. He is celebrating more than 60 years as a professional musician. He resides in his native Puerto Rico and in New York City. His nephews Johnny Rivera and Tony Vega are also notable salsa singers.
