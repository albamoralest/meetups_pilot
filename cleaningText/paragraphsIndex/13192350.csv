"Tanneberger started his music career with the dance music group Sequential One. In February 1993, Sequential One released their debut single ""Let Me Hear You"", followed by ""Dance""/""Raving"". Singles brought them small financial benefits; André gained the opportunity to organize a mini-studio. In 1994 the band added three new members: Ulrich Poppelbaum, Woody van Eyden and vocalist Morpha. In early 1995 the House Nation label released the group's first album, Dance.

"After great success in his native Germany, Sequential One gradually became known elsewhere in Europe. Their second album, Energy issued in Germany, was also released in the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland and Hungary. Despite this success and growing popularity, two members of the project —Woody van Eyden and Morpha — left in 1998; only André and Ullrich remained in the group. In 1999 Sequential One ceased to exist. Shortly before the collapse, André managed to release the last single ""Angels"" and the compilation album Decades.
