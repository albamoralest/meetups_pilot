"Born in Middletown, Ohio, United States, Burrell grew fond of jazz at a young age after meeting Herb Jeffries. Burrell studied music at the University of Hawaii  from 1958 to 1960, then, beginning in 1961, attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, graduating with degrees in composition/arranging and performance in 1965. While in Boston, he played with Tony Williams and Sam Rivers. In 1965, Burrell moved to New York City, where he worked and recorded with Grachan Moncur III, Marion Brown, and Pharoah Sanders. He also started the Untraditional Jazz Improvisational Team with saxophonist Byard Lancaster, bassist Sirone, and drummer Bobby Kapp. In 1968, Burrell co-founded The 360 Degree Music Experience with Grachan Moncur III and Beaver Harris and recorded two albums with the group. The following year, Burrell began an association with Archie Shepp, with whom he would play the 1969 Pan-African Festival in Algiers, and with whom he would go on to record nearly twenty albums.
