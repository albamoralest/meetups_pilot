"Brick By Brick was based on the Troy-Core style that the founding members grew up on. Mike Valente recruited Sean Green and Rory O'Brien after having a conversation about similar musical interests. Rich Roberts was picked as their frontman after a few other auditions. The idea was to be reminiscent of Hatebreed, Slayer, and the Troy style. At the time, they all lived in Troy, New York, and the ""Troy-Core"" moniker was embraced.

"In 2012, O'Brien decided to leave the band to focus more on his family. The band recruited James Muller to fill in, but eventually became a permanent member. The band released a 7"" split with the California-based hardcore band, Ruckus. Brick By Brick contributed a song to the split called ""In The Ruins"", which featured guest vocalist Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain. In 2014, Brick By Brick started touring. Not long after the band rose to the next level, Roberts was replaced by Ray Mazzola of Full Blown Chaos. The band has appeared at festivals including New England Metal Fest, Black n Blue Bowl, Tsunami Fest, Breast Fest, Motorcity Fest, Grownfest, and the Rebellion Tour, among others. In 2015, the band signed with Eulogy Recordings and released their first international record, This World, My Enemy. Their next international record, Thin The Heard, was released on Fast Break!
