"Z-Trip was born in Queens, New York, then moved to Phoenix, Arizona, as a teen. He was known early in his career for performing with the Bombshelter DJs (along with Bombshelter's founder Emile Ananian and DJ Radar). He became widely known when his collaboration with DJ P, ""Uneasy Listening, Vol. 1"", was released in 2001. Only 1000 copies were made, but the album was soon distributed over the Internet in MP3 format. Uneasy Listening topped many critics' best album of year lists, including Rolling Stone, Spin, Entertainment Weekly, URB, the Los Angeles Times and New York Times. Since then, he has become well known worldwide for his sold-out shows and eclectic style, including headlining slots at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and an opening slot for the Rolling Stones. He was also a part of Operation MySpace, a concert scheduled for American troops stationed in Kuwait; this show was simulcast on MySpace and the FX cable channel.
