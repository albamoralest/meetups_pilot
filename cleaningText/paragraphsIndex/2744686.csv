"Dello started his career as a musician in the skiffle era of the 1950s and was a founding member of the rock and roll band Grant Tracy and The Sunsets, after which he joined Steve Darbyshire's backing group, The Yum Yum Band, in the mid-1960s.  This led onto him forming Honeybus, with whom he scored the hit single ""I Can't Let Maggie Go"" in 1968.
",2,== Career ==
"Quickly leaving Honeybus rather than tour and promote the single, he next cut a solo album Into Your Ears in 1971, and also worked with John Killigrew. Ultimately he quit the music industry for other interests during the 1970s. Since then Into Your Ears has become a collectable album, with copies selling for over £1,200 in perfect condition. It has also been re-issued on compact disc in 2005, and again in 2009.
",3,== Career ==
"He wrote songs with all his bands (and also for The Applejacks). The Dello-penned song ""Do I Figure In Your Life?"" has been covered by Dave Berry, Joe Cocker, Iain Matthews, Dave Stewart, Paul Carrack, Dana,  Kate Taylor, Saturday's Crowd and Pierce Turner. His co-writer was Ray Cane. Dello was also a session musician, and he was hired for Unit 4 + 2, The Scaffold and The Roulettes.
",4,== Career ==
"The song ""I'm a Gambler"" by Lace (1969) was reissued as a single under the pseudonym Red Herring in 1973.
",5,== Career ==
"Dello's biggest success ""I Can't Let Maggie Go"" was given a second round of popularity when it was used for a 1970s Nimble bread TV commercial, which brought him much welcomed royalties which he successfully invested.
