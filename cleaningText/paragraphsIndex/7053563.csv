"George Colar, better known as Kid Sheik or Kid Sheik Cola, (15 September 1908 - 7 November 1996) was a New Orleans jazz trumpeter. He is most associated with Dixieland jazz and was a long-term performer with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band.  He got his nickname from his chic style of dress. In youth he took informal lessons from Wooden Joe Nicholas and briefly had a band of his own. He worked with George Lewis in the mid-1940s. Over the years, Kid Sheik performed with many jazz notables, including Harold Dejan's Olympia Brass Band and Louis Armstrong. By the 1960s he had his own band.
