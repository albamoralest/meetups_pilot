"Seaman performed drums on Dallon Weekes' various solo efforts, which led to Weekes proposing the idea to present themselves as a duo under the name I Dont Know How But They Found Me. Seaman and Weekes started playing small shows in late 2016, but kept the group secret. They officially debuted at Emo Nite Los Angeles' 2-year anniversary event on December 6, 2016. After the show, different sources wrote about a ""new side project"" by Seaman and Weekes, and confirmed the band name. Even when confronted with photos and videos taken at the shows, the duo denied the whole project for months, as they did not want to exploit their name recognition and association with the well-known bands they played in.
