"Kudo was born in Japan on July 31, 1967 at Narimasu Maternity Hospital in Narimasu, Itabashi. Kudo's family initially lived in Shibamata, Katsushika but would end up moving to Asaka, Saitama where at an early age she would enroll in Asaka's Shirayuri Kindergarten.

"As a child Kudo was very involved with singing, largely influenced by her mother who dreamed of becoming a singer. In Kudo's graduation collection from Asaka's 6th Elementary School in Aska City, she wrote that, ""It would be nice if I could become an actress or singer."" While at Asaka Daiichi Junior High School at the age of 14, she would audition for Star Tanjō!, where in the TV qualifying round she would sing ""Hello Goodbye"" by Yoshie Kashiwabara which would win her that round and advance her to the battle tournament round, for that she would sing ""Blue Angel"" by her cousin,Seiko Matsuda, however none of the production companies expressed interest and Kudo would not win the competition. While Kudo was enrolled at Tokyo Seitoku University Junior & Senior High School in 1983, she would visit Harajuku because the record label Bondo Kikaku was recruiting a new member for the group called Shojotai. Bondo Kikaku had also participated in the show Star Tanjō!. While still working with Bondo Kikaku in 1984, she heard a demo of Meiko Nakahara's song ""Kimitachi Kiwi Papaya Mango da ne"", which had just become a hit, this lead Kudo to believe Bondo Kikaku's President, Keiji Takasugi was taking the company in the wrong direction, and would make her decide to become a solo artist. In 1984, Kudo performed at the Nagasaki Kayo Festival, which was a television contest to where teenagers and young adults competed to become new idols by winning what was called the grand prix. On the show, Honda was highly evaluated by judges who noted her powerful voice and overwhelming signing ability which made led her to win the grand prix part of the competition. Following her success in the Nagasaki Kayo Festival, Kudo would make her debut under the name Minako Honda with the song ""Satsui no Vacane"", this lead her to receive a Japan Record Award for the best new artist of that year. Looking to follow up on the success of ""Satsui no Vacane"", Honda would release ""1986 nen no Marilyn"", in which a controversy would arise from her performances, in which Honda would shake her hips suggestively while wearing a navel costume, at the time this was not common for idols and was thought to be offensive. In 1988, she made an attempt to revive her dwindling career by forming an all girl rock group called ""Minako with Wild Cats"", the group however would disband a year later due to lack of any hit songs. In 1990 a turning point came for her career. Honda had auditioned for a part in the Tokyo production of Broadway play Miss Saigon, she won out over 15,000 other candidates for the part of Kim. She would go on to perform in leading roles in Fiddler on the Roof, The King and I, and Les Miserables.

"Towards the end of her life, she released several classical albums demonstrating her soprano singing voice, including religious works such as ""Amazing Grace"" and Ave Maria. She also sang theme songs for several anime programs. She did not abandon pop music in her adult career; indeed, she became recognized for her vocal improvement in the adult pop genre. Her song ""Tsubasa"" is famous for the ""long note"" that she holds for 30 seconds.
",7,== Later career and illness ==
"In 2004, Honda would add a period to the end of her name; this was done because Honda believed there was judgment to her surname. Honda became ill in late 2004, but still performed in December in spite of a fever and fatigue. When her cold-like symptoms failed to improve, she sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia on January 5, 2005. Honda was able to celebrate her 38th birthday at home feeling relatively well, but had a relapse shortly afterwards. Chromosome aberration was discovered and she received a dose of anticancer medicine from the United States to treat it. She recovered again briefly, but then suffered another relapse.
