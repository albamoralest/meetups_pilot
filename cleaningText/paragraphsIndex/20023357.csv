"While Woolstenhulme was in a music studio session, Lifehouse, then comprising Jason Wade and Sergio Andrade, was practicing in the adjacent room. Woolstenhulme, then playing with another band, bumped into them in the hallway. It was suggested that he check out Lifehouse, which was looking for a drummer to replace Jon ""Diff"" Palmer; in 2000, he joined the band.
