"Davis was raised in Binghamton, New York, where he grew up with jazz music being played in the household. He studied jazz under Jackie McLean at The Hartt School of the University of Hartford in Connecticut. McLean recommended Davis to Art Blakey, whose Jazz Messengers he joined in 1989. After Blakey's death, Davis joined the Hartt faculty in the early 1990s. Davis played in Chick Corea's Origin, and recorded with them in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Davis has been a member of the sextet One for All since its inception around 1996. Along with Davis, the band features Eric Alexander, Jim Rotondi, David Hazeltine, John Webber and Joe Farnsworth. Davis led his own bands in New York City in the mid-2000s.
