"Evelyn Faltis was born in Trautenau, Bohemia, in 1887, the second of three daughters of Carl Johann and Maria Anna Cecilia Magdalena Faltis (born Wiesenburg) who were Viennese bourgeoisie. She began her music studies at the Assomption convent in Paris and later studied at the Vienna Music Academy with Robert Fuchs and Eusebius Mandyczewski. She also studied at the Dresden Conservatory with Felix Draeseke and Eduard Reus, and in Munich with Sophie Menter. After completing her studies she moved to Berlin, but settled in Vienna in 1933. She became the first woman coach at Bayreuth and worked as accompanist at the Nuremberg Stadttheater am Ring and the Darmstadt Hoftheater, and after 1924 at the Berlin Städtische Oper. She died in Vienna of pneumonia.
