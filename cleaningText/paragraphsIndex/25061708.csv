"Berninger is a 1989 graduate of St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He went on to study graphic design at the University of Cincinnati, where he met fellow band member Scott Devendorf in 1991. The two quickly became friends. Berninger quit a career in advertising in his thirties to start The National. He told The Telegraph: ""I was doing well [in advertising]. But, once I entertained the thought that maybe I wouldn't ever have to go and sit in conference rooms with MasterCard to discuss web ads again, I couldn't shake it.""Berninger is married to Carin Besser, a one-time fiction editor for The New Yorker, who has often contributed to the band's songwriting (""Brainy"" and ""Ada"" from the album Boxer) and backup vocals. Together with Hope Hall and Andreas Burgess, Besser also helped direct the music video for ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"". They have a daughter named Isla. Berninger has stated that the song ""Afraid of Everyone"" was influenced by his anxiety about being a new father. Berninger has two siblings: Tom (who directed Mistaken for Strangers, a film about The National) and Rachel.
