"Brown was born and raised  in South Central Los Angeles. While in high school, Brown was friends with Gary Bias, Gerald Albright, Patrice Rushen, and Leon ""Ndugu"" Chancler. In the mid 1980s, he became a member of the Pan Afrikan Peoples Arkestra or ""the Ark"", of South Park, Los Angeles.  During 1987 Brown joined Earth, Wind & Fire alongside two other members of the Ark, saxophonist Bias and trombonist Reggie Young.  Before Earth, Wind & Fire, Brown was a member of Madagascar, a group composed of session musicians that recorded one album — Spirit of the Street — under the Arista label in 1981.
