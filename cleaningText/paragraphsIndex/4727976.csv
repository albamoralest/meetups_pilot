"Disheartened by the record company's attempt to slide her into a pop career, along with missing working with a band, she returned to Australia in mid-1989, where she and fellow Perth musicians Frank Celenza, Eddie Parise and Dave Leslie formed the band Baby Animals. The band met with success in their native Australia, releasing two albums, touring with Van Halen, and winning various awards before permanently disbanding in 1996. This was mostly due to legal battles with their record label Imago and Suze having nodules in her throat – she even had to stop singing for a short while because of them – in 1993, which forced the band to cut short the tour for their second album.

"After the demise of Baby Animals in 1996, DeMarchi pursued a solo career. Although living in Boston with her husband and young daughter (apparently temporarily in her mother-in-law's basement at one point), she signed to Mushroom Records Australia and released 1999's Telelove, produced by Bettencourt, and the single ""Satellite"". DeMarchi supported the album with a May tour around Australia as the singles ""Karma"" and eventually ""Open Windows"" hit the shelves. DeMarchi was also nominated for an ARIA Award for Best Female Artist.

"In the late 1980s, DeMarchi dated Gavin Rossdale, former lead singer and guitarist for the band Bush. Bush's song ""Comedown"" from 1994's Sixteen Stone is about their relationship.

On 27 August 1994, the couple married in the Azores, where Bettencourt's family is from. In 1996, they had their first child, a daughter Bebe Bettencourt.
