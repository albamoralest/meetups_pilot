"Born in Boston, Massachusetts, and raised in Eugene, Oregon, Bonham began singing at age five and playing the violin at nine. As a teen she received a full scholarship to the University of Southern California for violin, but she eventually transferred (and moved) to Boston, Massachusetts in 1987, where she attended the Berklee College of Music to study voice instead. While there she started writing songs and in early 1995 she released her first EP, The Liverpool Sessions, and the single ""The One"" won best single in The Boston Phoenix reader's poll.

"After recording at Fort Apache Studio in Cambridge for several months, in 1996 Bonham released her debut full-length album The Burdens of Being Upright. Magazines such as Rolling Stone and People noted her bold approach to rock music. The album went gold within six months and later that year she was nominated for the Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Performance and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance (for ""Mother Mother""). She then went on an extensive tour in support of the album.
",6,== Biography == | === The Burdens of Being Upright ===
"The first single, ""Mother Mother"", went number one on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for a month in late 1996. The second single, ""The One"", was a minor hit and peaked at No. 23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, and two different music video versions of the song were briefly in heavy rotation on video music channels MTV and VH1. The third and final single, ""Sharks Can't Sleep"" failed to chart in the US.

",8,== Biography == | === Down Here ===
"After the mild success of her first album, problems emerged during the recording of her next album from her own label. In 1998, all of the Island Records as well as Polygram Records and other associated labels were purchased by Seagrams, as the various labels now were under the umbrella imprint of UMG, or Universal Music Group, LLC.
",9,== Biography == | === Down Here ===
"Although Bonham had recorded a second album for release (in possibly 1998) titled ""Trails of a Dust Devil"", the new label delayed the release until mid-2000, re-titling it Down Here. The newly titled album – and the only single released from it, ""Behind Every Good Woman"" – failed to chart.

",11,== Biography == | === Bee EP ===
"In late 2001 she divorced Steve Slingeneyer (of the band Soulwax) after three years of marriage. At the same time, as Bonham began to record new music for her third album, Island Records cited they were going in a different direction (they were now favoring mostly male bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit) and she was released from her recording contract. She then left studio recording behind and began to tour in support of other groups such as the performance group Blue Man Group and even rock band Aerosmith. In 2003 she recorded and released an independent EP titled Bee. It included early versions of ""Shine"" and ""All Thumbs"" and a live version of ""Freed"" (from the ""Down Here"" album), and a cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Black Dog"", where she substituted violin solos for the signature lead guitar line in the original.
",12,== Biography == | === Bee EP ===
"She had only pressed 1,000 hoping to sell 500, but she eventually sold over 12,000 of the EP's while on the various tours. With the money made from the EP she returned to the studio to start work on her third full-length LP in Los Angeles, California. (The ""Bee"" EP was later re-issued in Europe as the ""Something Beautiful"" EP with the addition of a track titled ""Blink the Brightest"" and a bonus DVD with live performances.)
