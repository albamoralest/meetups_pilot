"Øystein Sevåg is a Norwegian composer, pianist and music producer. He was born in Bærum in 1957, beginning piano lessons at age five. As a teen he played bass in a rock band but returned to his classical roots in time to study piano, flute and composition at a private Music Conservatory in Oslo; by the 1980s, however, Sevåg had become fascinated by the possibilities offered by the development of the synthesizer, and he plunged into electronic music with his self-released 1989 debut LP Close Your Eyes and See.

"The product of five years in the studio, the album slowly crept into Billboard's New Age charts in the USA, and it landed Sevåg on the Windham Hill label to issue the follow-up, 1993's Link.

Signing to Hearts of Space Records, Sevåg resurfaced in 1997 with the acclaimed Bridge, with the London Philharmonia Orchestra, winning the Indie Award in USA for the best new age recording of the year.
