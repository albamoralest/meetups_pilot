"Larry Woodard is an American pianist, singer, and cabaret artist. He has also worked as a choral conductor, organist, vocal coach, accompanist, and jingle singer for television and radio commercials. Widely known for his mastery of a variety of musical styles and disciplines, Woodard was hailed by the New York Times as, “…a first-rate performer of all musical categories"" ""…who moves easily between the worlds of classical music and cabaret"" ""…can slither  through “Ain’t Misbehavin’,” move on to an operatic aria, and fall back to a medley of sentimental songs or humorous material"" ""…an artistic heir of Bobby Short, but with classical leanings.” Woodard has performed at the White House, the Metropolitan Opera House, Carnegie Hall, the New York Philharmonic, the Caramoor Festival, the Bard SummerScape, the 92nd Street Y, the Russian Tea Room, the Algonquin Oak Room, the New York Friars Club, the Morgan Library, the Frick Collection, Gracie Mansion, the official New York City mayoral residence, and other venues.
