"Until autumn 2005, Grosch worked as a cell phone seller. At that time he took leave from his job to participate in the third season of Deutschland sucht den SuperStar (where he also became romantically involved with co-competitor Vanessa Jean Dedmon). Because of his strong, husky voice and a few similarities to British singer Seal, Grosch became an early favourite with the judges and the audience, who enabled him to sing against competitor Tobias Regner during the final show. However, Grosch lost by vote, scoring 45% against Regner.
