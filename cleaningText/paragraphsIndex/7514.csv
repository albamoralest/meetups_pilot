She followed his advice and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. She was the original host of Sunday Breakfast on WFUV in New York City and a founding member of the Four Bitchin' Babes when they were formed in 1990. She is a lifelong astrophysics hobbyist and has included those themes in her music.
