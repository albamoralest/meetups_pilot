"A 2012 reviewer commented that ""The emphasis on melody during the set is noteworthy, as Nimmer never let his considerable chops dominate a piece for the sake of show. Here is a pianist who respects the song"". An earlier reviewer of Kelly Blue praised Nimmer's emulation of Kelly, and queried ""whether Nimmer's technique and intimacy with history will eventually lead to the development of a distinctive personal voice"".
