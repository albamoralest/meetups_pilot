"In Toronto she performed in a theatrical production of Under Milk Wood, originated the role of Ophelia in Cliff Jones's musical Rockabye Hamlet (originally known as Kronborg: 1582), and was a co-creator and star of the musical revues Hey Seester, You Want My Sailor? and Ice Folly. Beginning in 1976 she was a regular contributor of comedic songs to CBC Radio's Sunday Morning, frequently appearing on the program until she was dropped as part of a revamp of the program's format in 1994. In 1978 she released Civil Service Songwriter, her debut album as a recording artist. She has since released numerous other albums, blending both her comedic songs and forays into more serious songwriting. Following her departure from Sunday Morning in 1994, she was an occasional contributor to CBC's weekend pop culture magazine Definitely Not the Opera and the CTV Television Network's newsmagazine series W5, and performed on tour with the political comedy duo Double Exposure. She was one of the writers, with Bob Johnston and Jeff Hochhauser, of the musical Anne & Gilbert, based on the Lucy Maud Montgomery books Anne of Avonlea and Anne of the Island.
