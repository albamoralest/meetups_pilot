"After facing career setbacks, Savić managed to retrieve popularity with her fourth album Stranci (2019), on which she collaborated with hip-hop duo Corona and Rimski. In 2011, she married Serbian-Australian businessman from Queensland, Dušan Jovaničević, with whom she has two sons. The couple separated in 2020, following a highly publicized custody battle, in which Savić accused her then-husband of relocating their children to Australia against her will. In March 2021, she was eventually reunited with her sons after close to a year of separation.
