"On 27 November 2015, during an Accept show in London, Hoffmann revealed in an interview with Blackdiamond that he was working on a new solo album, which will probably be another in the neoclassical metal style, as his previous solo album Classical was. He also stated that this album will probably be ready to be released in 2015 but did not mention a certain time. This album turned out to be Headbangers Symphony and released on 1 July 2016.

"During the National Association of Music Merchants 2013 show, Hoffmann has unveiled a new signature guitar which was manufactured by Framus. This guitar is manufactured in two styles, a guitar in white called Flying Fortress and the other one is in chrome and has been made to resemble a World War II bomber which is called Flying Fortress. Hoffmann told Metal Shock Finland's chief editor, Mohsen Fayyazi:

"""Growing up in Germany everybody had a Framus guitar at one point or another and I could have never anticipated that one day I would be friends with Hans Peter Wilfer, the man behind the re-birth of his father’s legendary brand. I had no idea what an amazing company they really are until I went to their factory and saw first hand the unbelievable craftsmanship and quality they deliver. I am happy and proud to introduce my first signature guitar, a real Heavy Metal Axe made in Germany!""
