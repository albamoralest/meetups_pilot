"At the age of ten Stapf came across the title melody of Spielberg's film Schindler's List, a violin piece interpreted by Itzhak Perlman by the composer John Williams. Out of interest for the background of the play she made contact with the Holocaust-survivor Jerzy Gross in 2008. The former violinist belonged to the so-called ""Schindler's juden"", who had worked for the entrepreneur Oskar Schindler and were saved from murder in the extermination camp. The exchange of several years between Stapf and Gross led to the book Spiel mir das Lied vom Leben - Judith und der Junge von Schindlers Liste by Angela Krumpen in 2011. For the Westdeutscher Rundfunk Martin Buchholz documented a common journey to Poland to stations of Gross's suffering. Since 19 November 2015, an Internet website has been in existence that focuses on the encounter between Judith Stapf and Jerzy Gross. In January 2018 she played ""Nigun"" by Ernest Bloch in the German Bundestag in the commemoration hour for the victims of National Socialism.
