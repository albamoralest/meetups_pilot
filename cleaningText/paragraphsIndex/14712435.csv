"Fields and partner David Begelman founded the international talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA). At CMA, Fields and Begelman pioneered the movie ""package"", where the talent agency put their stars, directors and writers together on a single project. CMA developed numerous agents including Sue Mengers, Mike Medavoy, Sam Cohn, and Jeff Berg (who became president in 1979).   CMA was instrumental in the development of such stars as Judy Garland, Woody Allen, Henry Fonda, Marilyn Monroe, Robert Redford, Peter Sellers, Steve McQueen and later Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Burt Bacharach, Neil Young, and Jack Carter, and into the 1980s promoted the likes of Richard Gere and Mel Gibson. While at CMA, he was involved with numerous blockbuster films including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, American Graffiti and Star Wars. Fields played a key role in the merger of CMA with the International Famous Agency to form International Creative Management (ICM). Fields was a partner in the First Artists Company with Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Dustin Hoffman, Sidney Poitier, and Barbra Streisand. While First Artists only lasted for five years, it was unique in that it owned the films it produced, such as The Getaway (1972). He later served as president of MGM and United Artists.
