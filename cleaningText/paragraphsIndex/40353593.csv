",1,== Biography ==
"Delafose was born in Duralde, Evangeline Parish, Louisiana. As a child, Delafose fashioned fiddles and guitars out of old boards and cigar boxes fitted with window-screen wire. He eventually took up the harmonica, and at the age of 18 learned the button accordion. However, he soon turned to farming and did not pursue music as a career until the early 1970s. He began serving as an accordionist and harpist with a variety of local Zydeco bands. Delafose began his career playing in the fais do-do of his area, a Cajun dance party. Later, he gained public recognition with albums like Joe Pete Got Two Women (Arhoolie) and Blues Stay Away from Me (Rounder). In the mid-1970s, he formed the band The Eunice Playboys, with which he played until his death. The band continues under the direction of his son Geno Delafose.
