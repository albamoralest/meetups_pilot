The band toured and played numerous venues regularly including The Electric Circus and Fillmore East. In 1972, Ahlers moved to California, where he toured with Van Morrison and recorded three albums with Jesse Colin Young on Warner Bros. Records. He played the keyboard in Peter Rowan's band Free Mexican Airforce 1977–1978. During these years he also recorded with Gene Clark of The Byrds and rocker Greg Kihn.

He played keyboards on the albums Live at the Capitol Theater, After Midnight: Kean College, Garcia Live Volume One, Garcia Live Volume Four and Garcia Plays Dylan. In 1981, he became a founding member, songwriter and keyboard player in the rock-reggae band The Edge with bandmates Lorin Rowan and Jimmy Dillon. In 1990, Ahlers was hired by Gumby creator Art Clokey to create the music for the cult classic Gumby: The Movie, and hired Craig Chaquico from Jefferson Starship to play lead guitar. Owing to the time that it takes to complete a feature-length stop-motion film, the movie wouldn't be released until 1995.
