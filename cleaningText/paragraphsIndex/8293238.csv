While at NYU, Meyerhoff directed Twitch, a short film portraying a young girl's irrational fear that her mother's disability is contagious. Twitch kicked off the film festival circuit by winning a Grand Jury Prize at the Slamdance Film Festival and becoming a finalist in the Student Academy Awards. It has since screened in over 200 film festivals, won a dozen awards, and was picked up for distribution by PBS, Hulu, iTunes and the Independent Film Channel. Meyerhoff has since completed several music videos and commercials, including Team Queen, a Planet Out finalist which aired on Logo, Eternal Flame, which was in rotation on MTV Europe, and Like Our Fathers. Meyerhoff has received press mention from The New York Times, Film Threat, Flavorpill, The San Francisco Chronicle and numerous other publications. Meyerhoff was also profiled in the docu-drama series Film School, directed by Nanette Burstein (The Kid Stays in the Picture), which continues to air on IFC. In addition, Meyerhoff has taught directing and editing courses at New York University, The New York Film Academy, and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She has been a programmer for several film festivals and was recently a member of the HollyShorts and Slamdance Film Festival narrative juries.
