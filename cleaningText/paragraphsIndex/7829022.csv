"Macfarlane Gregory Anthony Mackey (18 February 1942 – 15 January 1997), known professionally as Tony McKay and Exuma, was a Bahamian musician, artist, playwright and author  best known for his almost unclassifiable music, a strong mixture of carnival, junkanoo, calypso, reggae, African music and folk music. His lyrics were deeply immersed in the West African and Bahamian tradition of Obeah, a system of spiritual and healing practices developed among enslaved West Africans in the West Indies, practiced by many on the islands of The Bahamas. In a 1970 interview, McKay, as Exuma, said the ""'electrical part' of his being 'came from beyond Mars; down to Earth on a lightning bolt'"". He described his music as ""all music that has ever been written and all music not yet written. It's feeling, emotion, the sound of man, the sound of day creatures, night creatures and electrical forces"".

"Born in Tea Bay on Cat Island, Bahamas, McKay and his mother Daisy Mackey moved to Nassau. He grew up there in a small house on Canaan Lane, shared by Ma' Gurdie, an older woman who McKay said ""danced so well"". ""When I sing, I can still see Ma' Gurdie's beautiful moves"".

"As a boy, McKay and his friends caught and sold fish to buy movie tickets. Watching the films exposed them to Sam Cooke and Fats Domino and other American blues singers, who they would imitate.
",3,== Early life ==
"McKay moved to New York City at the age of 17 to study architecture. He ""promptly ran out of money"". Friends give him an old guitar and knowing three or four chords, he started practicing old Bahamian calypsos. Homesick for Nassau, McKay began writing poetry about Ma' Gurdie and  Junkanoo. These poems became the basis for McKay's ""Brown Girl in the Ring"" (later a hit for Boney M), ""Rushing Through the Crowd"" and other Exuma songs. Due to McKay's greater interest in music, he did not complete his architectural studies.

"Nassau friends living in Brooklyn took McKay to Greenwich Village, introducing him to hootenannies in neighborhood cafes. McKay founded the group Tony McKay and the Islanders. During this time, McKay also performed at Cafe Wha? and The Bitter End. McKay often performed with well known musicians and comedians in small Greenwich Village clubs and bars. ""I started playing around when Bob Dylan, Richie Havens, Peter, Paul and Mary, Richard Pryor, (Jimi) Hendrix and (Barbra) Streisand were all down there, too, hanging out and performing at the Cafe Bizarre"". In 1969 Palisades Amusement Park advertised McKay as a featured artist during that year's season opening weekend. He appeared on a bill that included Peaches & Herb.

"In 1969 McKay launched the group ""Exuma"" (named after a group of Bahamian islands) with his then-partner and lifelong friend Sally O'Brien. He enlisted several musician friends, forming his backup band, the Junk Band. The band included O'Brien (as Sister Sally), Bogie, Lord Wellington, Villy, Spy Boy Thielheim, Mildred Vaney, Frankie Gearing, Diana Claudia Bunea (as Princess Diana), and his good friend Peppy Castro (Emil Thielhelm, lead singer of the Blues Magoos).
",9,== Musical career == | === Founding Exuma ===
"He soon gained the attention of Blues Magoos manager Bob Wyld. ""I'd been singing down there (Greenwich Village), and we'd all been exchanging ideas and stuff. Then one time a producer (Wyld) came up to me and said he was very interested in recording some of my original songs, but he said that I needed a vehicle."" Wyld recommended McKay to Mercury Records and convinced the record label to sign him.

"Creating an image and a persona that fit his music, McKay drew upon his Bahamian memories of the ""Obeah Man"". Bahamian life was rooted in West African tradition. McKay was a knowledgeable practitioner of bush medicine. He specialized in herbal remedies, especially the ""mystical cerasee vine"" (Bitter leaves or Momordica charantia), which he collected in Nassau. ""I grew up as a roots person, someone knowing about the bush and the herbs and the spiritual realm. It was inbred into all of us. Just like for people growing up in the lowlands of the Delta Country or places in Africa.""""I remembered the Obeah Man from my childhood - he's the one with the colorful robes who would deal with the elements and the moonrise, the clouds and the vibrations of the earth. So I decided to call myself 'Exuma, the Obeah Man'"". McKay further explained his interpretation of Obeah. ""Obeah was with my grandfather, with my grandmother, with my father, with my mother, with my uncles who taught me. It has been my religion in the vein that everyone has grown up with some sort of religion, a cult that was taught. Christianity is like good and evil. God is both. He unlocked the secrets to Moses, good and evil, so Moses could help the children of Israel. It's the same thing, the whole completeness - the Obeah Man, the spirits of air.""

"Hearing of McKay's success performing ""Junkanoo Drums"", New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival producer Quint Davis tracked him down by calling the Bahamian Embassy. Davis invited McKay to perform at the 1978 Festival. McKay performed at the New Orleans Jazz Festival from 1978 until 1991. The 1983 Festival program described McKay as ""Exuma - the Obeah man whose Caribbean music is similar in spirit to the street music of New Orleans"".

"By the 1980s McKay had moved to New Orleans and was a regular at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival.  He performed regularly at the Old Absinthe House, a popular venue on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter.  These nights often became jam sessions, as McKay would play songs that were not in the set list, attracting accomplished musicians, such as Bill Wyman and members of Bob Dylan's band. McKay said of New Orleans ""I found New Orleans to be a very cultural place where if you bring love to the people, they will give you the necessary energy to bring even more.""

"In 1994 McKay lived in Colorado, saying he found himself inspired by the area's ""peacefulness"". ""It comes from the love of what I am doing. Music is like eating and breathing - every fiber of me is in music. I've always been like that. The music energizes me and keeps me alive, I think. I have a lot I want to say in a positive way. I don't want to say anything negative. I try to go through every word and make sure that there is nothing negative gender-wise or any-kind-wise. If I have done anything in the past that is not that way, well, I beg forgiveness for that. But I try to move on a positive note."" McKay said he had recorded 30 new songs during 1994 with New Orleanian Charles Hancock and fellow Bahamian Rudy Green. At the time he was ""presently in the process of deciding which will make the final cut"".

"Aspects of McKay's ""Obeah Man"" persona influenced other artists, notably singer Nina Simone. Converting McKay's ""Obeah Man"" into ""Obeah Woman"", Simone assumed the role of ""priestess"", a role for which she was eminently suited. Her live performance was recorded on her album ""It Is Finished"". The song begins with drumming by Babatunde Olatunji and Simone asking ""do you know what an ""Obeah Woman"" is?"" She continues, altering McKay's lyrics: ""I'm the Obeah woman, from beneath the sea / To get to Satan, you gotta pass through me""... ""they call me Nina, and Pisces too / There ain't nothin' that I can't do"". Simone also performed two additional McKay songs during the live recording, ""Dambala"" and ""22nd Century"".

"Former Parliamentarian, Cabinet Minister, Chairman of the College Council of the College of The Bahamas and fellow Bahamian Alfred M. Sears said McKay as Exuma was ""A Bahamian visionary, humanistic philosopher and people's poet. Exuma gives expression to the beauty and power of the cultural life of the Bahamas - the people's every day experiences, folklore, myths, stories, junkanoo, rake and scrape, pain, joy, struggle and survival. His life and art reflect the wonderful cultural heritage and personality of Bahamians, drawing on the roots of Africa and the branches of the Amerindians, Europeans and Americans.""Bahamian musicologist Roney Ambrister, BEM said of McKay ""You could put him in line with (Joseph) Spence. He was a jubil fellow, very happy, he would grab his guitar, kick off, and the rest of the band would follow him"". Ambrister said while ""there was no such thing as 'Obeah music'"", the spiritual charge lay instead in McKay's fantastic clothing, artwork, and mystical lyrics, as in ""His time is short, his time is long, Exuma ain't right and Exuma ain't wrong.""

Solomon, an oil on canvas portrait of McKay by Stanley Burnside is in the permanent collection of the National Art Gallery of The Bahamas. The museum describes the painting as ""a bold commemorative piece of art that recognizes Mackey's memory and status as a leader at what he did... The viewer shouldn't ignore the crown that sits snugly over Mackey's locks, this is Burnside's assertion of Mackey's wisdom and kingly status in Bahamian history.""
