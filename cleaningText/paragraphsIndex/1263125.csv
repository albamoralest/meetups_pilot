"Femi Anikulapo Kuti was born in London to Fela and Remilekun (Remi) Ransome-Kuti (née Taylor; 1941-2000), and grew up in the former Nigerian capital, Lagos. His mother soon left his father, taking Femi to live with her. In 1977, however, Femi chose to move in with his father. Femi started playing the saxophone at the age of 15 and eventually became a member of his father's band. He studied at Baptist Academy and Igbobi College. Like his father, Femi has made commitments to social and political causes throughout his career. Femi's grandmother, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was a political campaigner and women's rights activist. Though Femi is the son of an international icon, he considers his mother, Remilekun Taylor, to be his greatest influence. He created his own band, Positive Force, in the late 1980s with Dele Sosimi (Gbedu Resurrection), former keyboard player of Fela Anikulapo Kuti. His international career began in 1988 when he was invited by the French Cultural Centre in Lagos and Christian Mousset to perform at the Festival d'Angoulême (France), the New Morning Club in Paris and the Moers Festival in Germany.

"In 2001, Femi collaborated on his album Fight to Win with a number of US musicians, including Common, Mos Def, and Jaguar Wright. Also in 2002, Femi contributed a remake of his father's classic song ""Water No Get Enemy"" to Red Hot & Riot, a compilation CD in tribute to Fela Kuti that was released by the Red Hot Organization and MCA. Femi's track was created in collaboration with hip-hop and R&B artists D'Angelo, Macy Gray, The Soultronics, Nile Rodgers and Roy Hargrove, and all proceeds from the CD were donated to charities dedicated to raising AIDS awareness or fighting the disease.

"Femi, the son of Afrobeat singer and political activist Fela Kuti, inherited his father's zeal for both music and activism. He started playing the saxophone and keyboard with his father's band when he was 16 and stepped into the spotlight, writing and singing after his father's demise. Femi remains politically inclined grooving to high energy funk, jazz and traditional African-fueled songs about political corruption, poverty and primitive living conditions suffered by most inhabitants in Nigeria's oil-rich nation. Femi Kuti's album Africa for Africa emphasized ""Bad Government"" as a problem in Africa. Before the 2011 elections in Nigeria, he reached out to the people that there was ""no difference between the three candidates contesting for the presidential seat in Nigeria"". He added, ""we could say we're moving in the democratic process. And it's probably better than going to war, but corruption is still very rampant. The people are hungry and sick. And the government controls the media, so it can't be critical"".

"Kuti also said: ""It's a very hypocritical situation. People settle for putting a meal on the table, but they don't know that the rest of the world doesn't suffer every day from power outages and water shortage. Nigerians don't even know about the history of African slavery, because it's not included in the text books."" He echoed the same sentiments in the 2015 elections by releasing a remix to the song ""Politics Na Big Business"" featuring Tuface Idiibia and Sound Sultan through his management company, Chocolate City.
",10,== Activism ==
"Kuti's song ""Make We Remember"" calls on people to remember the words of his father and ""great black people"", who fought for the emancipation of Africa. For a very long time, Femi has been using music to inspire, change and motivate African people.
