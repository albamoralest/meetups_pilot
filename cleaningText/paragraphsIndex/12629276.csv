She learned to play cello from age nine. In 1992 at age seventeen she formed the Seattle based duo Tattle Tale with Jen Wood. Tattle Tale were a part of the riot grrrl movement. They released an album, Tattle Tale, on the Kill Rock Stars label and an album on St. Francis Records. The band broke up in 1995.

",5,== Biography ==
"In 2001 Shive made news while raising money to fight tenant eviction and trying to raise awareness of tenant's and poor peoples' rights. Shive says she has been actively hearing voices and having experiences of what mainstream psychiatry would call delusions but that she frames differently, including mood extremes, all her life. In 2003 she became a founding collective member of The Icarus Project alongside Sascha Scatter, Jacks Ashley McNamara and Will Hall. The Icarus Project is a mental health movement characterized by the view that many phenomena commonly labeled as mental illness should instead be regarded as ""dangerous gifts"". She has said ""We see our madness as a dangerous gift to be cultivated and taken care of, not a disease to be cured"". In 2008 Shive was a contributing author to the anthology Live Through This: On Creativity and Self-Destruction on Seven Stories Press.
