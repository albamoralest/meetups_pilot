"Padma Talwalkar was born in Pune, India. She received training in Khyal gayaki in three main styles or gharanas: Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur. Her love for the accuracy and sanctity of notes she attributes to her first Guru, Pt. Pimpalkhare of the Kirana Gharana, and the latter to her training under the late Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar of the Jaipur Gharana. From Pandit Gajananrao Joshi she imbibed elements of the forceful and majestic Gwalior-Agra-Jaipur Gharana. She also gratefully acknowledges her musical debt to Smt. Kishori Amonkar whose musical influences remain with her even today.
