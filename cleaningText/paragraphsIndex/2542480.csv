"Quentin ""Butter"" Jackson (January 13, 1909 in Springfield, Ohio – October 2, 1976 in New York City) was an American jazz trombonist. In the early stage of his career, he worked with Cab Calloway for eight years. Later, he was a member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra and worked with Charles Mingus, Kenny Burrell, and others. On her album Dinah Sings Bessie Smith, Dinah Washington did a version of Bessie Smith's ""Trombone Cholly"" with Jackson on the horn, under the revised title, ""Trombone Butter"".
