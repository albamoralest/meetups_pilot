"Lambert is best known for his very fast playing style utilising a three-fingered picking technique with a six string bass. This fast picking technique was essential during his time in DragonForce to be able to play at the high tempos that the band is known for. He is also known for playing guitar style solos on the bass and for using slap and pop and two-handed tapping techniques.
