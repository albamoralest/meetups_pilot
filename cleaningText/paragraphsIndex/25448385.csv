"Parrish became known for his eclectic house DJ sets, in which he mixed ""classics and obscurities"" from disco, jazz, soul, and new wave. His early releases weaved these influences into ""slow-burning, immersive grooves."" Vice stated that ""his lengthy sets are masterclasses in the manipulation of black dance music, EQ heavy workouts that educate, entertain and inform,"" and added that ""Parrish has an innate understanding of the pleasure that comes with repetition.""
