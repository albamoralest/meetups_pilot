"Radin has said that much of the album was inspired by a bad break-up. It was released exclusively to iTunes for a month, before attracting attention from major labels. Released on Columbia Records in May 2006, We Were Here presented the first batch of songs Radin ever wrote. The album drew critical acclaim and received a four-star review from Rolling Stone, who praised it for Radin's ""whispery, silver-bell voice"" and its themes, calling them ""poignant and refreshingly frank."" The record hit number one on the iTunes Folk Album Chart and included a number of well known musicians, including Ryan Adams who played guitar on the song ""Lovely Tonight"". Zach Braff hand-picked one of the tracks to be featured on the soundtrack for The Last Kiss. Radin played the song ""Today"" from the album, along with five other songs, for Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi at their August 16, 2008, wedding.
