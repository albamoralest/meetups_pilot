"While attending the School of Foundation Studies & Experimental Workshop at Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University) Duffy met John Taylor. Together they formed the group Duran Duran, along with Taylor's childhood friend, Nick Rhodes. While Taylor was the guitarist (later switching to bass) and Rhodes played the synthesizer, Duffy was the band's vocalist/lyricist and bassist.  When bass player Simon Colley joined, Duffy moved to drums. He left both the school and the band in 1979, before Duran Duran signed with EMI in 1980. He went on to form Obviously Five Believers, sometimes known as The Subterranean Hawks or The Hawks, and he made his first four-track recordings. The Hawks' only single, ""Words of Hope"", was released in 1981.

"In 1982, he created the band Tin Tin, with John Mulligan and Dik Davis (both then of Fashion), Andy ""Stoker"" Growcott (of Dexys Midnight Runners) and Bob Lamb (original producer of Birmingham band UB40). Originally called Holy Tin Tin before being shortened, the band was signed with WEA Records in the UK, and released the single ""Kiss Me"" in 1982 but was unsuccessful. By 1983, Tin Tin had signed with Sire Records in the US, and ""Kiss Me"" hit the dance charts there. Another single, ""Hold It"", was also released in 1983 which peaked at no.55 in the UK. After a stint of working in the US, Duffy returned to England and signed a deal as a solo artist with Virgin 10. Now working under the name Stephen ""Tin Tin"" Duffy, he recorded a new version of ""Kiss Me"" which was released in 1984, this time only in the local West Midlands area, followed by a nationwide release of ""She Makes Me Quiver"" which peaked at no.88 in September 1984. At the end of 1984, Duffy recorded a third version of ""Kiss Me"", produced by J.J. Jeczalik and Nicholas Froome, which was released in February 1985. It debuted at no. 22 and peaked at no. 4 in the UK Singles Chart and stayed in the UK Top 10 for five weeks altogether. Duffy followed this with the single ""Icing on the Cake"", which peaked at no.14 in June 1985.

"Duffy's first full album, The Ups and Downs (produced by Duffy, Froome, Jeczalik, Booker T. Jones, and Stephen Street), reached number 35 in the UK. Prior to the release of The Ups And Downs, Stephen Duffy and his brother Nick formed their own design office called ""DUFFY and DUFFY"". For the album's preview release, they had an exhibition of about 80 paintings, drawings, photographs, and video. A new single, ""Unkiss That Kiss"", was released in September 1985 and peaked at no. 77 in the UK. For this single, Duffy had become known as Stephen A.J. Duffy after dropping the ""Tin Tin"" reference from his stage name. The single was the first to be taken from the album Because We Love You, released in early 1986, for which he was credited simply as Stephen Duffy. Additional singles from the album were ""I Love You"" (which peaked at no. 86) and ""Something Special"" which was a collaboration with Sandii (of Sandii & the Sunsetz), however this single (and the album itself) failed to chart.

The Lilac Time put out the albums Paradise Circus in 1989 and & Love For All in 1990 for Fontana before being dropped.

"In 1999, Duffy found a tape recording of 1978–1979 Duran Duran music that was in storage. Shortly afterwards, he had a chance meeting with Nick Rhodes. Reminiscences led to a desire to collaborate, and they ended up re-recording the music on the tape. They did not change any of the lyrics, and used only late-70s-era instrumentation with modern recording techniques. The result was the album Dark Circles, released under the name The Devils.
