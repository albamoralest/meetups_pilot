"Kanon currently has four Cellos. The white cello is known as ""Mikazuki-san"", which means ""crescent moon"" and this is the cello she normally uses during live performances. The red cello is known as ""Nanachie-san"", which means ""wisdom"" used in most music videos. According to Wakeshima, Nanachie-san is very hard to play but she manages. Her third cello is a brown cello called ""Yaeharu-san"", which means ""multi-layered spring"". Yaeharu-san is very special to Wakeshima as she has had it since middle school, and it is the one she practices on and records with. Her newest is a new silver cello named ""Momotose.""
