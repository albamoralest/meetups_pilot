"Following the departure of electro funk/old school hip hop group Mantronix's original rapper MC Tee, Wilson, (then known as Bryce ""Luvah"", or MC Luvah), and D.J. D, the cousin of the remaining Mantronix member, Kurtis Mantronik, joined Mantronix for 1990's This Should Move Ya.  The album spawned two top-10 hits on the British singles chart, ""Got to Have Your Love"" at #4, and ""Take Your Time"" at #10.  In the United States, the album reached #61 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Wilson was the primary rapper on all of the rap-based tracks that appeared on the album, and was responsible for the lyrical content.

"Mantronix's final release, with vocalist Jade Trini replacing D.J. D,  was The Incredible Sound Machine in 1991. The Incredible Sound Machine, which tended to favor new jack swing and house music over hip hop, was considered both a critical and commercial disappointment. Shortly after the tour and promotion related to the release of The Incredible Sound Machine, Mantronix disbanded.
