"While a teenager, he formed Young Black Preachers (YBP) with his god-brothers, Tre Smith and Aaron ""Projeck"" Butler, and released a number of EPs alongside his solo work. This output and his Lunch Special mixes drew the attention of Steve Ellison, aka Flying Lotus, and led to Jae's move to Los Angeles in 2007. After spending 6 months involving himself in the Los Angeles beat scene, and meeting the rest of the Brainfeeder roster, Jae was signed to the imprint. Following the release of Dxnce, Jae's debut Brainfeeder project Rappayamatantra was released in 2011. Throughout that time, Jae continued the Lunch Special series and contributed beats to the Captain Murphy mixtape Duality. Having toured extensively with label mate Teebs, Jae released his debut album, Raw Money Raps, in 2012. In 2013, Jae released the Bad Jokes mixtape featuring members of the Black Jungle Squad and production from Jae himself, Jonwayne, Oliver the 2nd, and Flying Lotus. The Night Took Us In like Family, his first collaborative album with producer L'Orange, was released on Mello Music Group in 2015. Their second collaborative album, Complicate Your Life with Violence, was released on Mello Music Group in 2019.
