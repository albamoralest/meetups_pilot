"The audio engineering references for Mike D. Stone of the Record Plant recording studio in Los Angeles, California, often get confused and mixed with the references of Mike Stone (record producer) of the United Kingdom who worked at Trident Studios and Abbey Road Studios, and engineered for Queen, Genesis and Asia. And their references sometimes are confused with Mike ""Clay"" Stone of Clay Records, who worked with largely UK punk and metal acts.
