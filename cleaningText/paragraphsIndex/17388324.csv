"Johansson was a member of melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity for almost six years. He joined  in 1993 after the band's vocalist at the time, Anders Fridén, left the band and their rhythm guitarist Mikael Stanne took the vocalist role to solely focus on it, leaving an empty rhythm guitarist spot, which Fredrik took. Prior to the release of Projector in 1999, he was asked to leave Dark Tranquillity due to a lack of commitment to the band, stemming from the fact that he wanted to become a family man.
