"As a musician, Fridmann was the bassist and a founding member of Mercury Rev.  He gave up his role as a touring member of the band in 1993 to concentrate on producing other artists.  In 2001, Fridmann was included on MOJO's 100 Sonic Visionaries list and was described as ""the Phil Spector of the Alt-Rock era"".  In 2007, he received a Grammy for The Flaming Lips' At War With The Mystics at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical).  In 2010, three Fridmann-produced albums were listed on the Rolling Stone 100 Best Albums of The Decade: MGMT's Oracular Spectacular, The Flaming Lips' Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, and Sleater-Kinney's The Woods. Fridmann often brings a distinctive, expansive, open sound to the albums he produces, which has much in common with that used by Mercury Rev.
