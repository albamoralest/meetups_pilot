"Ares is the founder of the Norwegian dark metal/death metal band Aeternus, in which he plays guitar and does the vocals. The band was formed in 1993 as a trio, composed of Ares, Erik Vrolok, and Morrigan. From 1995 to 1997, Ares was the bassist of the black metal band Gorgoroth, before Aeternus' debut album, Beyond the Wandering Moon, was released in 1997 on Hammerheart Records. Aeternus has since toured with bands such as Emperor and Deicide, and has released an additional five full-length albums. Ares is now the only remaining original member of Aeternus. In addition to Aeternus and Gorgoroth, Ares has played in several other extreme metal bands, and has done live work for bands such as Immortal and Grimfist.
