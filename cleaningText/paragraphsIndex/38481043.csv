"Kezdy started with the band Strike Under in either 1979 or 1980.  When Steve Bjorklund, the band's lead singer, left the band in 1981, the remaining members, including Kezdy, formed a new band called Trial By Fire.  When that band folded in 1982, Kezdy went on to replace Camilo Gonzalez in Naked Raygun, joining them in time for their second album All Rise. Naked Raygun ceased performing in 1992. In 1994 Kezdy replaced Steve Saylors in Pegboy, the band started by former Naked Raygun bandmate John Haggerty. When Naked Raygun started playing again in 2007, Kezdy was replaced in Pegboy by Mike Thompson.  Kezdy suffered a stroke in 2010 and was unable to perform live with Naked Raygun, so Sensitive Pete, who was already part of Jeff Pezzati's band, the Bomb, played bass for their live shows. Kezdy did re-join Naked Raygun for live shows in 2013, playing baritone guitar with Fritz Doreza playing bass. Other bands that Kezdy has played with include the Rainbow Girls (with his brother John Kezdy, of the Effigies), the Interceptors and Arsenal (both with Santiago Durango). Kezdy played a Gibson G3 bass guitar.
