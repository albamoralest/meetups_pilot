"He started his career in the band Erter, Kjøtt og Flesk (1971–1975), in his home town of Tromsø. The band broke up in February 1975 after a job in Skien where they were support act for Fairport Convention. During one of the breaks, one of the band members was caught stealing a raw steak, and since Moe was not yet 18 years old, the legal age for prosecution in Norway, he was brought home by his father, ending the band's career. In 1978, Moe moved to Bergen with fellow musicians and friends Bjørn Vassnes and Turid Pedersen, the latter two starting the band Nøkken together with Hans Petter Gundersen. Moe later joined ""Nøkken"" as a concert musician. During the same time he also played with HP Gundersen's band ""Rust"". Moe was founding member of the rock band Dance with a Stranger where he played as a bass guitarist up until his death. He also continued working as a studio session musician, participating in projects like Olav Dale's Son Mu, Ernesto Manuitt y Grupo and Groovy.
