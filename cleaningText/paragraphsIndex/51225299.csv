"The genre of which Fénée was fond was the light and gaudriolesque one. One must not expect to find in his compositions the philosophy and poetry of Béranger. On the opposite, his inspiration was that of Michel-Jean Sedaine, Charles Collé and Marc-Antoine-Madeleine Désaugiers.

"His songs which have achieved the most success include Faudra que j' vous l'amène un soir, — Ça fait bien dans le Paysage, — N' y a que le premier Pas qui coûte, — Mon Petit Bonhomme de chemin, — Ousqu' est ma Mitrailleuse ? — Allez-donc vous asseoir, — l'Épicurien reconnaissant, — C'est toujours la même Ficelle, — la Bergère, and many others. Finally a medley of Fanchon la Vielleuse which is a small masterpiece of Gallic gaiety.
