"Radu Malfatti is an Austrian trombone and bass harmonica player, and composer. He was born in Innsbruck, in the province of Tyrol, on December 16, 1943. Malfatti is associated with the style of music known as reductionism  and has been described as ""among the leaders in redefining the avant-garde as truly on-the-edge art."" His work ""since the early nineties... has been investigating the edges of ultraminimalism in both his composed and improvised work."" He also operates B-Boim, a CD-R-only record label focusing on improvised and composed music, much of it his own.
