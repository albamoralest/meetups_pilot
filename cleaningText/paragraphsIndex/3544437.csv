"He was born in Nakahiranai, a village that is  now part of the Hiranai township in Aomori Prefecture.  He lost his sight at around age two from measles before becoming a live-in apprentice of a Tsugaru-jamisen performer called Toda Jūjirō near his home town.  Before World War II he spent many years touring Tohoku and Hokkaido, playing before doorsteps and making money any way he could.  After the war he became more widely known, first as an accompanist for the famous Tsugaru folk song singer Narita Unchiku (who named him ""Chikuzan""), and subsequently as a solo performer of the Tsugaru-jamisen repertory.  His performances, for many years taking place regularly at a small venue called Shibuya Jean-Jean in Shibuya Ward of Tokyo, often featured long solo improvisations, which he entitled ""Iwaki"" after the tallest mountain in Tsugaru.
