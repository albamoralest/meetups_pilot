"In 1996 Dahlgren made headlines in the Swedish press when she came out as a lesbian through her civil union with jewellery designer Efva Attling, whom she met when she moved to Stockholm in the early 1980s. In connection with the civil union, Dahlgren changed her surname to Dahlgren-Attling. In 2009 they went through a marriage ceremony, after Sweden passed its gender neutral marriage law.
