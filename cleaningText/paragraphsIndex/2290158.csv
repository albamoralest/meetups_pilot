"Geoff Kresge is a songwriter, guitarist, bassist, and record producer. He played with the punk rock/horror punk band AFI for most of their early career, from 1992 through 1997, and co-wrote the majority of their early material alongside frontman Davey Havok. During an AFI hiatus in 1993, he briefly moved to New York to join street punk band Blanks 77. He later went on to play with Canadian horror rock group The Forbidden Dimension and also a high-energy rock band, The Daggers, before subsequently joining the psychobilly band Tiger Army. Though he played an electric bass in his previous bands, for Tiger Army he chose an upright bass.

"Kresge joined Tiger Army in 1999 just as the band became a full-time touring band, hitting the road in support of their debut album. He appeared as standup bassist on the band's next two full-length albums, Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite and Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise, and in each of the videos from those records. In September 2004 he announced his departure from Tiger Army. He cofounded the band Viva Hate with longtime friend Matt ""Wedge"" Wedgley (formerly of The Force) and joined the HorrorPops on guitar, not long afterward. He cowrote and played guitar on the band's second album, Bring It On!.

"In July 2007, Kresge announced that he had left HorrorPops and disbanded Dead Body Records, stating that he wished to dedicate full attention to Viva Hate, which was followed by an American tour in support of Sick of it All and Madball. Tiger Army's official website announced Kresge's return to the band in January 2008. In February 2014, Kresge announced he would be leaving Tiger Army for the second and final time via a statement on his Facebook page. He stated that ""Tiger Army has been off the road since the end of 2008 and has not released an album since the year before. The fans all around the world have been hungry for new music and tour announcements for the past five years. I’ve finally accepted that if I want to remain a full-time musician, it’s time for me to move on.""As of 2018 Kresge has been playing bass for Californian hardcore punk band, Fear.
