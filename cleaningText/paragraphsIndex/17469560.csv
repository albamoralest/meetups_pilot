",1,== Life and work ==
"Born in Vilnius, in the family of musicologist Ona Narbutienė and geologist Vytautas Narbutas, Onutė Narbutaitė learned the basics of composition from Bronius Kutavičius at M.K.Čiurlionis School of Art, graduating in 1979 from the Lithuanian State Conservatory (now the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre) where she studied composition under Julius Juzeliūnas. From 1979 to 1982 she taught music theory and history at the Klaipėda Faculty of the Lithuanian State Conservatory. Since then she has been working as a freelance composer in Vilnius. Her works have been performed at various concerts and music festivals in the many European countries, USA, Canada, South Korea. Narbutaitė develops a very personal musical language with characteristic features such as intellectualism and solid structuring, expressive instrumentation and suggestive melodic writing, multilayered vertical stacking and an intense musical flow. Her aural imagery correlates with a great number of cultural reminiscences in her music. She has received commissions from the Helsinki Festival, the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, the Bavarian Radio's musica viva series, the 50th Warsaw Autumn, the festivals Klangspuren Schwaz, Velvet Curtain (Krakow – European Capital of Culture 2000 project), Kaustinen XX Chamber Music Week (festival's guest composer),  Europäisches Musikfest Münsterland, ISCM World Music Days / Gaida 2008, as well as the Louth Contemporary Music Society, the Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre, the Frankfurt Brandenburg State Orchestra, the Seattle Chamber Players, the Ostrobothnian Chamber Orchestra, the Kronos Quartet (Fifty for the Future project), among others.
