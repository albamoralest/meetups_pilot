"Froom has written music for solo instruments, chamber ensembles, and orchestra, with and without voice. His compositions have been widely performed throughout the United States and Canada, as well as England, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Cyprus, China, New Zealand, and Australia. His music has been described as “intensely dramatic yet deeply formal,” ""intellectually engaging, explosive with imagination and with a satisfying visceral power,"" balancing “diatonic pastoralism with acerbic angularity, Stravinskian rhythmic urgency with lyrical counterpoint.” Among his most critically acclaimed works are ""Circling,"" Sonata for Solo Violin, 2nd Piano Trio, and Amichai Songs. Among his most frequently performed music is his saxophone music, which includes a saxophone quartet, ""Flying High"" for solo alto saxophone, and ""Arirang Variations"" for alto saxophone, bassoon, and piano. All of his works, are published by the American Composers Alliance. Froom's work has, since 1991, appeared regularly on the concerts of the 21st Century Consort, the new music group-in-residence at the Smithsonian Institution. They have premiered and recorded many of his works.
