Known for playing in several bands in the Seattle scene, his first was the punk rock band The Fastbacks. Through the mid-90s, Stuverud played in the bands Three Fish and Tres Mts., both side projects of Pearl Jam bassist, Jeff Ament. Three Fish released the albums Three Fish (1996) and The Quiet Table (1999), through Epic Records. The album Tres Mts. (Three Mountains), with Doug Pinnick of King's X and guest guitarist Mike McCready, was released in 2011. Pearl Jam's 2011 box set, Vitalogy, includes the previously-unreleased demo version of  ""Nothingman"" with Stuverud on drums. In 2012, he worked again with Jeff Ament, this time with NYC singer-songwriter, Joseph Arthur, to form the band, RNDM. They released their debut album, Acts (2012) and followed up with Ghost Riding (2016). Stuverud has collaborated with Ament on his solo albums, including I Should be Outside(2020), Tone (2008) and While my Heart Beats (2012).
