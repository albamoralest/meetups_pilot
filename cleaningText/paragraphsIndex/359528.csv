"Currie was the teenage lead vocalist for the all-female rock band the Runaways with bandmates Joan Jett, Lita Ford, Sandy West, Jackie Fox and Vicki Blue. Bomp! magazine described her as ""the lost daughter of Iggy Pop and Brigitte Bardot"". Currie joined the Runaways in 1975, at age 15. The teen rock anthem ""Cherry Bomb"" was written for her at the audition. Assessments of her impact differ; one reviewer has written in 2010 that ""the received wisdom that [the Runaways] carved out new territory for female musicians is hard to justify—it's doubtful that the predominantly male audience who flocked to see the 16-year-old [Currie] in her undies picked up any feminist subtext.""

"After three albums with the Runaways (The Runaways, Queens of Noise and Live in Japan), Currie went on to be a solo artist. She signed a contract with Mercury saying she would record four records, but she left the Runaways after the third album, thus she was obligated to record another album. She recorded it solo and the result was Beauty's Only Skin Deep for Polygram Records. Marie Currie did a duet with Cherie on her solo record ""Love at First Sight"".

"Cherie and Marie went on a US tour in 1977, and when Marie would join Cherie on stage to sing the encores the audience would go wild. Then they went on a Japan tour in 1978. While in Japan, the twins performed on many TV shows. So Cherie ran with the idea of two blonds are better than one, and changed the band name from Cherie Currie to Cherie and Marie Currie. With Marie Currie, she recorded Messin' with the Boys for Capitol Records and Young and Wild for Raven. Messin' with the Boys was released in 1980. Messin' with the Boys received more radio play than Beauty's Only Skin Deep and, the song ""Since You Been Gone"" off Messin' with the Boys charted number 95 on U.S. charts. Both the single ""This Time"" and the album Messin' with the Boys made the top 200 on U.S. charts. Cherie and Marie performed on television shows in the 1980s including Sha Na Na, The Mike Douglas Show,The Merv Griffin Show among others. Along with the album recordings with Marie, Cherie and Marie sang, wrote, and produced songs for The Rosebud Beach Hotel and its soundtrack called, The Rosebud Beach Hotel Soundtrack. In the film, they acted and sang together. In 1991, Cherie and Marie Currie performed a tribute concert to Paula Pierce, a member of The Pandoras, at the Coconut Teaser. For the final performance, the remaining Pandoras backed the Curries. Currie performed at the Runaways' reunion in 1994 with other Runaways Fox and West. Her sister Marie joined the three Runaways on stage and performed with the band. In 1998, Cherie and Marie held a concert at the Golden Apple, in support of their re-released version of Messin' with the Boys. Cherie's ex-bandmate West joined Cherie on stage to perform some of the Runaways songs. The Curries and West signed autographs after the show. Young and Wild was released in 1998. It was Cherie and Marie's first compilation album. It contains tracks from Beauty's Only Skin Deep, Messin with the Boys, Flaming School Girls (the Runaways' compilation album), and one new track co-written by Marie.

"Currie struggled with drug addiction for much of her younger life, a major factor in the abrupt ending of her career.

"In 1979 an alternative cover photo of Currie's album Beauty's only Skin Deep appears in the background of the feature film Rock 'n' Roll High School. It appears when the Ramones are backstage. The sisters Dot, Helen, and Darby (played by Chloë Sevigny, Carisa Glucksman, and Darby Dougherty) are characters in the 1997 film Gummo,  written and directed by Harmony Korine, who has mentioned that ""Dot and Helen were based off [sic] a combination of Cherie and Marie Currie, home schooling, and The Shaggs.""In 2006 the teen drama The O.C., in the season 3 episode ""The Man of the Year"", Marissa makes an entrance to ""Cherry Bomb"", while dressed in a provocative schoolgirl outfit, to Kaitlyn's boarding school.
