"Kevin Devine grew up in Brooklyn and Staten Island and has spent significant time in Manhattan and Queens. Devine graduated from Fordham University at Lincoln Center in 2001, majoring in journalism and writing for the school newspaper, The Fordham Observer. He first played in the band Delusion, which later changed its name to Miracle of 86 (referring to the 1986 New York Mets). At Fordham he was able to hone his solo, acoustic style by playing at various open-mic and college events. Devine released his first solo album, entitled Circle Gets the Square, in 2002 under the record label Immigrant Sun Records, as well as being produced by Bill Manoudakis. During this time he also appeared in regular stints at the Wetlands Preserve venue in New York City.

"Although still relatively unknown, Devine gained some popularity with his 2003 album, Make the Clocks Move. This album's songs reflect Devine's political views and a growing introspective style, inspired by recent death of his father to a stroke. These two styles would become a staple in Devine's music that followed.

"It is the first of two albums released on Triple Crown Records. It is also the first of three albums produced by Chris Bracco and Mike Skinner (ex-Miracle of 86). In 2005, Devine released his third full-length album, Split the Country, Split the Street. He signed with Capitol Records, who released his fourth album, Put Your Ghost to Rest, on October 17, 2006. Only four months after his major label debut, Devine was dropped from Capitol Records due to EMI merging Virgin and Capitol Records.
",7,== History == | === Increased success (2002–2007) ===
"Devine was able to gather a strong fan base as a result of his exposure through touring with Brand New (who were also formerly signed to Triple Crown Records). First appearing as their opening act on their 2004 spring tour, Devine made a small splash among their fan base; however, opening for them again in April 2006 and joining their 2007 Spring tour with Manchester Orchestra greatly increased his fan base and affected his career. Devine also toured solo with Jesse Lacey of Brand New and singer-songwriter Grace Read.

"After negotiations with Capitol Records, Put Your Ghost To Rest was re-released on April 20, 2008 by Procrastinate! Music Traitors. Several new demos were featured on Devine's MySpace page around this time. A majority of the demos would later be properly featured on Brother's Blood and a single for ""Another Bag of Bones"" was released in August 2008. The tours throughout 2008 were in support of both the Put Your Ghost To Rest re-release and his new material.

"In December 2008, Devine announced in an interview with Popwreckoning that his new album Brother's Blood would be released on April 28 on Favorite Gentlemen records. He also announced a tour with Manchester Orchestra and the release of the I Could Be With Anyone EP in support of the upcoming album. He toured extensively in 2009–2010 for Brother's Blood, including dates with Manchester Orchestra, Brand New, Thrice, and Nada Surf. He also played a number of major music festivals, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, The Bamboozle and Bonnaroo. On July 6, 2010, Devine released the She Stayed As Steam EP, featuring outtakes from Brother's Blood.
",11,== History == | === Brother's Blood and Bad Books (2008–2010) ===
"In an interview with Manchester Orchestra's Andy Hull, Hull confirmed that Manchester Orchestra and Kevin Devine would be releasing a split EP entitled ""I Could Be The Only One"". He later confirmed in a January 2010 interview with AbsolutePunk that Manchester Orchestra and Devine had finished a currently untitled album featuring eight songs, with four songs written by Devine and the other four written by Hull. The album was to be released under the band name Bad Books. In August 2010, the band officially announced their self-titled debut album Bad Books would be released on October 19, 2010.  A 4-date east coast tour in support of the album was also announced. Another short acoustic tour followed in December 2010, with only Kevin Devine and Manchester Orchestra frontman Andy Hull playing Bad Books songs, as well as solo songs.

"On August 26, 2010, Devine announced on his Facebook page that he had begun writing his sixth album. A post made on his Facebook page also revealed tentative song titles which included ""Between the concrete & clouds,"" ""The first hit,"" ""Off-screen,"" ""A story, a sneak,"" ""The city has left you,"" ""11–17,"" ""I used to be someone,"" ""Sleepwalking through my life,"" ""Wait out the wreck,"" and ""Merry Levov"". (The song ""Merry Levov"" was possibly renamed ""Awake in the dirt"", as it does not appear on the album yet would explain the lyrical content of the later renaming.) Several rough draft lyrics of these songs were added to his Facebook notes page. Recording was completed on March 6, 2011. Between the Concrete and the Clouds is the first record made by Devine that is fully backed by a band, featuring musicians Brian Bonz (keyboard), Chris Bracco (a.k.a. Plosive) (bass, keyboard), Mike Fadem (drums, percussion), Russell Smith (electric guitar), and Mike Strandberg (guitar, mandolin). It was recorded in 10 days over a span of a month, produced by longtime collaborator Chris Bracco and mixed by Rob Schnapf.

"In March 2011 Devine toured with River City Extension, and released a split 7"" EP. Devine's songs on the EP are an acoustic version of ""Between the Concrete and Clouds"" and ""Walls"", a Tom Petty cover. Two 7"" singles, ""Luxembourg"" and ""Part of the Whole"", were released on May 17, with the album Between the Concrete and Clouds to follow later in the year. During an Alt Press interview on July 6, 2011, Between The Concrete and the Clouds was officially announced for a September 13, 2011 release in the US on Razor & Tie/Favorite Gentlemen Records. He performed some of his new material on tour starting in spring 2010. A few songs on the album (most notably ""Awake in the Dirt"") are influenced by the book American Pastoral by Phillip Roth.

Devine opened for The Get Up Kids on the first leg of their Fall 2019 tour. Devine launched a Patreon titled the ""Social Club"" on April 2, 2020.
