"Erak attended Kamiak High School and graduated in 2003. While there, he met fellow Fall of Troy member Andrew Forsman while participating in the Kamiak Show Band drumline. Along with classmates Mike Munro and Tim Ward, they formed a band called The 30 Years War. Munro left the band during their late high school years, and in 2003 the remaining members renamed the band to The Fall of Troy.

"After forming in 2003, while in high school, the band released their first album through Lujo Records. Erak remained with the band until their 2010 hiatus, and joined again in 2013 when the band announced its reunion. The band has since released OK in 2016 independently to critical and fan acclaim alike. The band has been hinting at new material in 2019 that is rumored for release in 2020. The band recently announced a weekend of shows on the east coast, as well of a handful of shows in California to close out 2019, potentially to garner attention for an early 2020 release from the band.

"During The Fall of Troy's hiatus, Erak played in the rock band Just Like Vinyl. They released two albums that are still available, the first being Self Titled and the second being Black Mass released by Superball Records. Erak has said in many interviews he believes that Black Mass is one of his personally favorite albums he has had a part in making. The band is currently on Hiatus as Erak works on new music/The Fall of Troy.

"During the Fall of Troy's original run, he was the lead vocalist in local Seattle Hardcore band ""The Hills Have Eyes"". He also spent a brief period of time as the drummer for The Monday Mornings. The Fall of Troy bandmate Andrew Forsman replaced him when he left. In early 2015, Erak performed with instrumental progressive rock band Chon at SXSW for Audiotree, and played a variety of songs from The Fall of Troy, Just Like Vinyl, and a cover of Nirvana's ""Heart Shaped Box"". Despite being called a one-of-a-kind performance, Erak has since played two other shows with Chon. At the Audiotree Music Festival 2016 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, members of Chon featured with The Fall of Troy in multiple songs. Then, on Chon's ""Super Chon Bros"" tour stop in Detroit, Michigan, Erak performed on Chon's song ""Can't Wait"" and then the group proceeded to play The Fall of Troy's song ""F.C.P.R.E.M.I.X."" In 2018 Erak released an EP titled The Whole Story under the name ""Thomas Erak and The Shoreline"" which was music all written and recorded by Erak himself with help from former bandmate Jake Carden of Just Like Vinyl, and a couple other friends. The EP was released by Blue Swan records. Interestingly, Erak recorded the music in a very interesting and difficult format. Where he would start with the drums, and basically improv drum tracks to a chosen BMP or ""click track"" until the drums made up a song. He would then repeat this with bass, then guitars, and finally vocals. Erak stated in his biography ""the making of the Whole Story"" that he wanted to challenge himself, and used this opportunity as an experiment to ""see if he could even do this by myself"". The EP is full of experiments in genre for Erak as it both harkens back to his post-punk/hardcore roots with tracks like ""Sick and Tired"" as well as prog-rock, ""Silver Tongue"". The EP also explored genres yet explored by Erak, that tend to be some of the most interesting moments of The Whole Story such as ""Payday Loans"" An almost Alt-County anthem. As well as almost straight forward Pop-Rock with songs like ""He Said, She Said"" and ballad, ""Heartpoon"". Erak has said in the future he hopes to experiment more with ""The Shoreline"" moniker, but for now is hard at work on a brand new project that is yet to be named, but will be released in 2020, as well as a long-rumoured upcoming release from The Fall of Troy ""Mukiltearth"" once again.
