",1,== Biography ==
"Paula Schopf was born in Santiago, Chile. The daughter of academics Federico Schopf and Marta Caballero Santacruz, Paula and her family were exiled to Frankfurt Germany when she was three years old after the coup d'état of 1973 and the political persecution that followed.
",2,== Biography ==
"Paula returned to Chile at the age of seven though her brothers and father stayed in Germany. Despite this, she maintained contact with the rest of her family, especially her older brother, who used to mail her electronic music cassette tapes.
",3,== Biography ==
"The tapes sent by her brother were part of Paula's formative musical influences. Her brother introduced her to some of the electronic music that would strongly influence her and she was turned on to the genre by acts such as Depeche Mode, Kraftwerk, Chris & Cosey and Cabaret Voltaire. Other influences came from the classical and psychedelic music that she heard at home. ""I have always listened to classical music. My stepfather was a German hippie and I got to know a lot of psychedelic music from his old records. Not like ""The Doors"", more cutting edge, more underground: Soft MachinePaula studied in the ""Colegio Latinoamericano de Integracion"" or ""Latin American Integration School"", known for its opposition to the military government. She says: ""I loved my school, but hippie music quickly started to bother me, all these ""peñas"" (“in Chile, Folk music encounters”) seemed boring. The Left identified with that kind of music: ""Canto Nuevo"", ""charango"" and ""guitar"". I love Brazilian music, I've heard amazing modern Latin American stuff. I love cumbia. By then I started to develop my own taste"". Paula was more interested in the avant garde electronic music sent by her brother than the politically charged music of her peers, and found little else to interest her in the limited music scene under the military dictatorship. In 1990, Paula went to university to study philosophy, but before the end of the first year she was back in Germany, attracted and fascinated by the development of what would become techno culture. It was her first time visiting Germany since she moved to Chile with her mother.
