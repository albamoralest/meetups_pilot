"Fishman was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Syracuse, New York. Fishman had a passion for the drums from an early age and emulated John Bonham, the drummer for Led Zeppelin, Bill Bruford of Yes, and Keith Moon of The Who. He went to Jamesville-Dewitt High School in a suburb of Syracuse. After graduation in 1983, he attended the University of Vermont to study engineering. Shortly after his arrival, he met Mike Gordon and Trey Anastasio and founded the band Phish. Deciding against engineering, he and Anastasio transferred to Goddard College.

"The band Phish was named after him (he is commonly referred to as ""Fish"" among many other nicknames) though other explanations for the name have been given. In addition to drumming, he also sings back-up vocals and occasionally lead-vocals (usually on cover songs, most of them humorous – the best examples are Prince's ""Purple Rain"", Syd Barrett’s ""Love You"", and ""Terrapin"", Neil Diamond's ""Cracklin' Rosie"", Will Smith's song ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit It"", and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd's ""Bike"").  Worthy of note are his more serious vocal efforts, including lead vocals on Phish's cover of the Talking Heads song ""Crosseyed and Painless,"" and his vocal duties on the Phish originals, ""The Moma Dance,"" ""Taste,"" and ""Ghost.""  He is well known on tour for his Electrolux vacuum cleaner solos and playing while wearing a donut-printed muumuu dress. He has admitted to taking acid before playing early in the band's career.
