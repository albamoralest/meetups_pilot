During this time, he became internationally recognized as a major soloist and chamber musician. He was also one of the founding members of the Bläser der Berliner Philharmoniker (""Berlin Soloists""), which made a number of masterful recordings – including Brahms's ""Clarinet Quintet in B Minor, Opus 115"". Additionally, he co-founded the Ensemble Wien-Berlin.
