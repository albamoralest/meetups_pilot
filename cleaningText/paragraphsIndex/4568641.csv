",1,== Biography ==
"Born Edinburgh, Scotland, Paton grew up in the south-eastern suburb of Gilmerton, Edinburgh, where he attended Liberton High School. His first band was called 'The Beachcombers' and they signed a recording contract in 1968 with CBS Records. They changed their name for The Boots and published their first single, ""The Animal In Me"". This was soon followed by ""Keep Your Lovelight Burning"", but after about two years, the band split because of Financial problems in 1970. He then replaced a guitarist in the Bay City Rollers for a short period of time but never recorded with them. After leaving them in October 1970, he became a member of another Band called 'Fresh', which changed their name for Christyan and published a single, ""Nursery Lane"", in 1971. While still playing with the band, he took a job as a musician in a nightclub called Tiffanys where he met Ian Bairnson.
",2,== Biography ==
"In 1973, Paton was a co-founder of Pilot. With Ian Bairnson, Billy Lyall and Stuart Tosh, they recorded several demos with EMI Records and recorded their first album From the Album of the Same Name which was published in 1974. On it was included their first major hit, ""Magic""  and Bairnson, who was still not an official member of the band, joined them after the recording of the first album. They released their second album Second Flight in 1975, and its single ""January"" topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, ironically beginning week ending 1 February. and it was followed in 1976 by their third, Morin Heights which was recorded at Le Studio in Morin Heights in Quebec, Canada, and produced by Roy Thomas Baker. 
",3,== Biography ==
"The same year, he and Bairnson started working with producer Alan Parsons and published a first album under the name Alan Parsons Project, Tales of Mystery & Imagination. Paton played bass and sang with the band until the 1986 album Stereotomy as he continued to work with other artists as a session musician. He also played on the first two albums by Kate Bush in 1978, The Kick Inside and Lionheart. 
",4,== Biography ==

In 1984, he was a member of Keats. In 1985, he participated to the original score for the movie Ladyhawke which was written, composed and played by Andrew Powell and produced by Alan Parsons.
",5,== Biography ==
"His first solo album was released in 1991, titled Passions Cry (under the name of Davie Paton), and the second album Fragments in 1996, that was also under the same name. In 1980, Paton already recorded an album with the title No Ties No Strings at the Abbey Road Studios, which was never released. In 2003, however, the album The Search was released, which was a new recording of the ""lost album"" from 1980. In the following years, David Paton released other solo albums.
