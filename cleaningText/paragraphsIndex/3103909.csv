"Born Ewa Alberstein in Szczecin, Poland, her name was Hebraized to Chava when she moved to Israel with her family in 1950. She grew up in Kiryat Haim. In 1964, when she was seventeen, Alberstein was invited to appear at the Hammam Nightclub in Jaffa. She sang four songs, accompanied by herself on guitar and her brother Alex on the clarinet. The program was broadcast live on the radio. After a guest appearance on Moadon Hazemer, recorded on Kibbutz Beit Alfa, she signed a recording contract with CBS. Early in her career, she appeared at the Amami Cinema in Haifa's Neve Sha'anan neighborhood. Haaretz columnist Neri Livneh described her as ""a little slip of a thing in a blue youth movement shirt, her face covered by huge glasses"". Alberstein was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1965 and became one of many Israeli artists to rise to stardom by entertaining the troops.

"Alberstein is a champion of liberal causes. Throughout her career, she has been an activist for human rights and Arab-Israeli unity. In 1989, her song ""Had Gadya"" (a spin-off on the traditional song ""Chad Gadya"", sung at the Passover seder), in which she criticizes Israel's policy towards Palestinians, was banned by Israel State Radio. The song was later used in the film Free Zone by director Amos Gitai in Natalie Portman's seven-minute crying scene. Alberstein is also a champion of the Yiddish language, both in her recordings and in a video titled ""Too Early to Be Quiet, Too Late to Sing"", which showcases the works of Yiddish poets.
