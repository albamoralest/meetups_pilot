"Derakh is of Iranian, Irish, Austrian, Hungarian, and Russian ancestry. He attended UCLA and earned his certificate in producing/engineering. Derakh is an avid guitar designer. He has worked with Grover Jackson of Jackson Guitars and has personally designed several of the guitars he currently plays (the most famous being The Disruptor). One of his motivations for designing his own guitars is his desire to create something unique yet functional, and having the public wonder ""Wow, what is that guy playing?"" He also designed a signature model for Yamaha called the AES-AD6 which was made in a very limited factory run and is highly collectable.
",6,== Personal life ==
"Derakh has a son named Michael Melody-Davidson. According to Metal Sludge, his stage name is meant to imply the phrase ""I'm Here to Rock,"" with the spelling of the last name as a tribute to his Iranian heritage.
