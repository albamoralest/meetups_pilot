",1,== Biography ==
"West was born in Leicester. He learned to play guitar in his youth, but later switched to electronic production, studying music technology at De Montfort University. He initially used the stage name Aparatec, releasing an EP of material under that name in 2007. His first release as Rival Consoles was issued later in 2007 by Erased Tapes Records, which has released all of his albums and EPs.
",2,== Biography ==
"West has remixed tracks by Jon Hopkins, Vessels, Ólafur Arnalds, Nils Frahm, Max Cooper, Noisia, Sasha and Toydrum. Rival Consoles' style is a combination of ambient, shoegaze, minimal techno and cinematic—often created with analogue synths, pedals and degraded processes. Pitchfork described Rival Consoles' sound as ""high-brow, avant-garde electronic music in the vein of Jon Hopkins and Nils Frahm"". West has also scored work for contemporary dance such as Alexander Whitley's Overflow and has scored an episode of Netflix's Black Mirror (""Striking Vipers""). His track ""Recovery"" was used in a 2020 television commercial for Blue Dragon foods.
