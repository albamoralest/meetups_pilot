"Sven Thomas Magnusson was born 1963 in Gävle, Gävleborg County, Gästrikland, Sweden. At 14 years of age, he changed his name from Magnusson to Di Leva, inspired both by his mother's Italian maiden name and idols like Leonardo da Vinci and Charlie Chaplin. Thomas started his career with the band The Pillisnorks, debuting with the EP 4 Visitors on 1 January 1980. Later, Di Leva formed the band Modern Art, which subsequently became Modærn Art. In autumn 1981 Di Leva signed a record contract as a solo artist with the recently started company Adventure. The following year, Di Leva released his debut album, Marginal Cirkus. After a short time at the company Stranded, Billy Bolero took Di Leva to the newly started company Papa Records, and with the release of the album På ett fat Di Leva became known throughout the country. Di Leva said ""I want to create great art in the form of simple music for the large audience."" With the song ""Kom till mig"", recorded with strings from Fläskkvartetten and Raj Montana Band, Di Leva reached the Trackslistan ranking in 1985 for the first time and made his first hit. The following year he released his third album, Pussel.
