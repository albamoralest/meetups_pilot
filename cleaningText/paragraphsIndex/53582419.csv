Besides taking lessons, he attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he also played with Nick Brignola and Bob Mover. He is self-taught on double bass and performed with musicians at hotels in the Catskill Mountains. He continued to play bass in New York City with Freddy Cole and Buddy DeFranco. Beginning in 1984, he played guitar for several years in the Artie Shaw Orchestra led by Dick Johnson in addition to learning the trumpet. He recorded and toured with his father, saxophonist Al Cohn. In the 1990s, he was a member of the Carmen Leggio quartet with Bill Crow. His daughter Shaye Cohn plays cornet with Tuba Skinny.
