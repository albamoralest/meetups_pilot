"She suffered a hiatus starting in 2010, after a series of medical conditions: she was first diagnosed with burnout after a series of anxiety episodes. After a year of recovery, she was discovered with a melanoma and had her lymph glands removed. After the operation, she had pain in her shoulder, as a result of a pinched nerve, and she was diagnosed with nerve damage, causing a constant pulsating pain in her left arm. After two and a half years, she returned to the last Thunderdome festival, where she performed a set using mostly one arm.
