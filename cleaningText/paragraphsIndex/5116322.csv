"Scott Shiflett joined Face to Face in 1995 replacing original bassist Matt Riddle. Shiflett became both a co-songwriter and co-producer of the band's records along with bandmate Trever Keith. Shiflett and Keith also formed Viva Death, a side project of Face to Face, as a vehicle for their baritone guitar driven experimental rock. Viva Death features contributions from Shiflett's brother Chris, drummer Josh Freese, and longtime Face to Face producer/mixer Chad Blinman. Shiflett plays all the instruments on Viva Death's later recordings. Shiflett also performs with his brother Chris in Jackson United, and has filled in for Chris as lead guitarist in Me First and the Gimme Gimmes on several tours since 2004.
