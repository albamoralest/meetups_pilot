"Family Fodder is an English post-punk group revolving around songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer/producer, and guitarist/keyboard player Alig Fodder. Formed in London in the 1970s, it has had a sporadic existence ever since, disbanding in the 1980s then reforming. NME described their song ""Dinosaur Sex"" as a ""forgotten post-punk classic"". The first Family Fodder single, ""Playing Golf (With My Flesh Crawling)"", a joint release between Parole Records and Fresh Records, was released in 1979. In the same year a 12"" single was released on Small Wonder Records by the same musicians as Frank Sumatra And The Mob. A series of Family Fodder singles and 12"" EPs followed on Fresh together with the album Monkey Banana Kitchen, often featuring French singer Dominique Levillain. The best-known singles were the indie chart entries ""Debbie Harry"", ""Savoir Faire"" and ""Film Music"". Also released were the mini-albums Sunday Girls and Schizophrenia Party on Fresh, and later the All Styles double-LP on Jungle Records, which Trouser Press hailed as ""consistently enjoyable and infused with invention, cleverness, talent and a totally open outlook""Alig Fodder continued to record and perform as Family Fodder over the years with evolving line-ups as well as under various alter-egos such as DJ Katface, Johnny Human, Vox Humana and The Lo Yo Yo.

Allmusic called it ""one of the better reunion albums of the post-punk generation.""In 2010 Family Fodder released Classical Music, featuring the singing of Darlini, daughter of original vocalist Dominique Levillain. It was followed in 2013 by Variety.
