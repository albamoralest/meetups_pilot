"Cunnigan grew up in Compton, California and attended Crenshaw High School with Ice-T. Cunnigan was one of the few students attending the school who was interested in rock music. His uncle was an important influence. He introduced Cunnigan to different groups and a diverse number of styles in the genre. Cunnigan became an enthusiastic fan, eventually buying a guitar from his local music store. He dedicated himself to learning, starting at 12. He was entirely self-taught. Cunnigan's guitar playing and showmanship earned him respect among his fellow students, including members of the Crips gang. He also taught guitar to fellow students, including D-Roc the Executioner, who later joined Body Count.
