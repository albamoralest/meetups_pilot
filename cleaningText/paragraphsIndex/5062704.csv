In 1984 KAT was considered the favourite act at Jarocin festival. The tour with Hanoi Rocks quickly led the band to the top of polish rock. In 1985 KAT released their debut album 666 and its English version Metal and Hell. After several spectacular shows, KAT released another album, Oddech Wymarłych Światów, and then, after several arguments between the members, KAT stopped playing.
