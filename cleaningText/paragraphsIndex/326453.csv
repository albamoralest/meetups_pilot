"Tim Skold was born on 14 December 1966 in Skövde, a small city in Västergötland, Sweden. He grew up in Timmersdala, 21 kilometres northwest of Skövde.
",3,== Biography == | === Early life ===
"He has a sister named Linda. Skold grew up in a very liberal setting as the son of a 15-year-old mother named Åse and a father trying to get by as a semi-professional drummer. At age 11, Skold joined a playback band (where the band mimes over recorded material). Skold's band would play for people at school meetings with Kiss, Bowie and Sweet songs playing on a cassette player. Skold first rented a bass guitar at age 12, and by the time he was 13, he was playing and singing in his first real band. Skold later met guitarist Harry Cody at a New Year's Eve party, and they formed a creative partnership that would last for many years to come. Their dream was to go to the US to be rock stars. At age 17, after 2 years of studying Process Engineering at a boarding school, Skold moved into his own apartment and took a factory job making military equipment. A half-year later, he was drafted into the army. He brought his bass to the base and sneaked into the shower stalls to practice after everyone went to sleep. Skold also kept rehearsing with Cody on the weekends, and once out of the army he took on many odd jobs including library assistant, Volvo employee and as a gardener at a bathhouse. At age 19, Skold and Cody talked a Swedish record company into allowing them to make a record, which they could use as a demo to reach the American market. Starting off as Shylock, their determination soon paid off in the form of Kingpin.

"During the early '80s, bassist Skold and guitarist Cody formed the glam metal band Kingpin in their native Skövde, Sweden. They were inspired by the flamboyant hard rock bands flowing out of Los Angeles at the time, as well as the UK acts such as Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Zodiac Mindwarp.
",6,== Biography == | === Kingpin ===
"The band kicked off their career with a 7"" single titled ""Shout It Out"" (which hit #1 in Sweden) in 1987. They then drafted vocalist Zinny J. Zan and drummer Stixx Galore a short time later. Kingpin released their only Swedish album, Welcome to Bop City, the following year, and then moved to Los Angeles.

"=== Shotgun Messiah ===
",8,== Biography == | === Shotgun Messiah ===
"Signed by Cliff Cultreri at Relativity Records, Kingpin changed their name to Shotgun Messiah (due to a San Francisco-based band holding the rights to the name Kingpin), remixed and re-packaged Welcome To Bop City as a self-titled album, and released it as their international debut in 1989. After having MTV smash hits such as ""Don't Care 'Bout Nothin'"" and ""Shout It Out"", whilst the band was in progress of making a follow-up to their debut self-titled album, Zan was let go. They hired a new bassist, Bobby Lycon, from New York City, and on Cody's suggestion, Tim Tim switched to lead vocals. At this time, Tim Tim, whose role was now frontman, went by the name Tim Skold. They released Second Coming in October 1991, which was enthusiastically received by the media and was their most successful album to date. The album featured two singles, ""Heartbreak Blvd."" and ""Living Without You"".
",9,== Biography == | === Shotgun Messiah ===
"November 1992 saw the release of the 5-track EP, I Want More, which featured two new punk cover tracks and the re-recorded ""Babylon"" punk cover, along with the re-recorded ""I Want More"" edit and an acoustic version of ""Nobody's Home"", all three from their previous album Second Coming. Soon after came the departure of Stixx and Lycon.
",10,== Biography == | === Shotgun Messiah ===
"Still under contract with Relativity Records, Skold and Cody returned to Sweden for the recording of the third Shotgun Messiah album, Violent New Breed, which leaned towards the industrial end of heavy metal. The album was released in September 1993 and is now considered a cult classic due to the ""before its time"" incorporation of industrial influences. However, at the time of release, it received mixed reviews and continued public indifference, which eventually convinced Skold and Cody to end the band, leading Skold to embark on his solo project, Skold.

"After the break-up of Shotgun Messiah, Skold went on to pursue a solo career. Writing all songs and playing all instruments himself, his self-titled debut album, Skold, was released in 1996 by RCA. The album was co-produced with Scott Humphrey.
",13,== Biography == | === SKOLD ===
"Promoting his debut album, Skold and the rest of the live SKOLD band went on a short tour with Genitorturers.

During his solo career, Skold also provided remixes for several bands, such as Prong, Nature and Drown. He also met KMFDM front-man Sascha Konietzko during his time in the studio.
",14,== Biography == | === SKOLD ===
"Around 2002, Skold recorded a follow up to his 1996 self-titled album. These songs have never been officially released. Skold stated in an interview with The Sychophant that he had made a demo with 10 copies ever made. The demo had 10 songs on it. Six of the 10 were released on file sharing networks without Skold's permission: ""Burn"", ""Dead God"", ""I Hate"", ""Believe"", ""The Point"", and ""Don't Pray"". The demo is known as the Dead God EP, although Skold says that it was called Disrupting the Orderly Routine of the Institution. The original artwork was made with an inkjet printer and was the title written in drippy letters. This demo was given to several friends that Skold considered trustworthy, but his songs appeared on the internet from one of them. Skold said that ""someone suggested to me that I should go back to them and finish it off and release it. And maybe I will one day, who knows?""On 3 November 2009 ""I Will Not Forget"", ""A Dark Star"", and ""Bullets Ricochet"" were released on iTunes and Amazon as new SKOLD singles. Also that November, Skold's official website announced that he was to release his second solo album in early 2010. However, the album remained unreleased in 2010.
