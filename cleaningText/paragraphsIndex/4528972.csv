"Cummings started playing the five-string banjo at the age of twelve, he started learning basic chords and progressions, and became a fan of bluegrass music. In his late teens, he encountered the early recordings of Stevie Ray Vaughan. While in college, in 1987, he saw Vaughan perform. His first public guitar performance was in 1997 when he played at his friends wedding reception. In his late twenties, he formed a band, Swamp Yankee, and, in 1999, he released an independently produced album, The Long Way. The trio spent two hours in a recording studio to record the nine songs for the album.

"After the release, the band went on the Northeast blues circuit. In 1998, he walked into a Northeast Blues Society open jam, which led to Cummings’ winning the right to compete in the Blues Foundation's 1999 International Blues Challenge, in Memphis. The following year he released his debut recording, The Long Way. Bluesprint magazine said it was ""a barrage of guitar pyrotechnics that calls to mind a grand mix of the styles of past masters like Albert King, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Jimi Hendrix"".

Bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton volunteered to play on and produce Cummings' solo debut recording, 2003’s self-released From the Heart. Recorded in Austin, Texas, it featured Cummings fronting Double Trouble (including Reese Wynans) in their first recording project since Stevie Ray’s passing.

"The blues is best served up live, with an enthusiastic audience and a killin' band, and that's exactly what guitarist Albert Cummings does[...]. Cummings effortlessly shifts from chimney subdued stylings to raucous roadhouse raunch to soaring yet stinging lead lines, driving his audience to frenzy in all the right places.

"In February 2020, Cummings released his 11-track Provogue Records debut titled Believe, produced by Grammy Award-winning producer Jim Gaines. Recorded at the iconic FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Cummings notes the influence the location had on the process of creating this project, “If I had recorded those same songs anywhere else, then Believe would have sounded like a completely different album.” Arguably one of the most notable tracks on the album is a cover of the song Hold On by legendary soul duo Sam & Dave, illustrating Cummings' ability to fuse genres while remaining stylistically unique and fresh.
