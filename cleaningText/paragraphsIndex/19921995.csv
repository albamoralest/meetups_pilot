"Smith helped co-found The Pop Group in 1977 and would play with them until they disbanded in 1981.  Smith was also part of the line-up when the band re-formed in 2010. While the Pop Group was still active, Smith also joined The Slits in 1979, replacing Budgie, and would play with them until they disbanded in 1981. After the Pop Group and the Slits, Smith teamed up with Adrian Sherwood and performed with the New Age Steppers and various other acts on Sherwood's On-U Sound Records label.  He married Neneh Cherry, who was also involved with the New Age Steppers, during this period.  Smith and Cherry then went on to form Rip Rig + Panic with former Pop Group guitarist Gareth Sager. This band performed from 1981-1983. In 1986 Smith joined PiL for the tour to support their Album release and became a permanent member of the band, playing on their next two studio albums Happy? and 9.  Smith left PiL in 1990 a few years before the band broke up.  However, Smith re-joined the band when John Lydon reformed it in 2009. In addition to working with his regular bands, Smith has also done a lot of session work, recording with artists such as Terrence Trent D'Arby, The The and Björk. Bruce Smith's father was the celebrated Avant-garde artist Hassel Smith.
