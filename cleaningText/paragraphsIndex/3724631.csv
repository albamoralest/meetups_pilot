"As a child, Syntek began his artistic career by acting in television commercials during the late 1970s, subsequently participating in the Pinwheel program produced by RTC, and then as a comedian in Alegrias de medio día (infantil) in 1979 which later led to the hit TV show ""Chiquilladas"" broadcast on Televisa in the first half of the decade of the 1980s. After leaving the program he decided to devote himself to the world of music and began working as an assistant and programmer in music recording studios. He was nicknamed ""Syntek"" by his friends because of a peculiar event: Syntek at that time did not have enough money to buy a keyboard, so he would borrow them from friends; this situation led him to be known as ""El sin Teclados"" (The Keyboard-less, in Spanish) after which he derived the name Syntek. After having participated with members of the group Caifanes to form the band ""Pistolas de Platino"" and then joining ""Kenny y los Eléctricos"" until 1989, he formed his own group called ""Aleks Syntek y la Gente Normal"".

"Throughout 2017 and 2018, Syntek became the subject of controversy as a result of his strong criticisms of reggaeton music. He has called it a ""vulgar"", ""misogynist"", ""cheap"" and ""generic"" genre which promotes ""wrong values"" in society, and on one occasion he stated that listening to reggaeton could induce people into committing crimes. In early 2018, Lemon Brick, a British teenager, accused Syntek on his Instagram page of making unwelcome sexual advances towards him. After the accusation, Syntek wrote, “It was an in[n]ocent joke and I apologize.” The Mexican singer asked Brick to take the post down. “I have a family, 2 beautiful kids and a lovely wife, and you are putting us in danger,” he said. Lemon replied by further posting on his Instagram videos showing the private messages he and Syntek exchanged.
