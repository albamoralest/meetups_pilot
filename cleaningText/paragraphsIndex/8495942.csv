"In his childhood, Aute studied at the De La Salle School, where he learned English and Tagalog, which is used within his family. At an early age, he showed unusual ability as a painter and sketcher.

"At the age of eight, he made his first trip to Spain. In Madrid, he sang for the first time in public with the Hotel Aveneda orchestra, interpreting the song ""Las hojas muertas"" (""The Dead Leaves""). At age 9 he watched On the Waterfront, a movie that had a powerful influence on him and inspired him to write his first poems in English. Another cinematic influence at that age was the movie Niagara, where he discovered the eroticism and sensuality of Marilyn Monroe.
