"Elephant Micah is a musical band or stage name of southern Indiana songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joseph O'Connell.  Recording mostly at home, Oâ€™Connell has produced an eclectic body of work since beginning the project in 2000.  Elephant Micah's inconsistently available music has become a cult favorite among some lo-fi/indie and folk rock audiences. O'Connell has released recordings with BlueSanct Records, the experimental-leaning Time-Lag Records, and a number of other very small labels. In addition, he has issued several short-run CDs on his own LRRC (Luddite Rural Recording Cooperative) imprint, also home to music by collaborator Jason Henn.
