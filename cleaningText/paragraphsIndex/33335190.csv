"Fjeld's first recording contract was with the Jonas Fjeld Rock 'n' Rolf Band, a comedy band which included Herodes Falsk, in 1972.  He switched to acoustic folk after listening to Eric Andersen's album Blue River. His first solo album, Take Two Aspirins and Call Me in the Morning, was released in 1975. The album Svært nok for meg (Big Enough for Me), released in 1990, went gold in Norway. It included Engler i sneen (Angels in the Snow), a duet with Lynni Treekrem. Fjeld was introduced to Rick Danko by Andersen in 1990. Danko, Fjeld, and Anderson started doing concerts in September 1990, and recorded the eponymous Danko/Fjeld/Andersen album in Norway in 1991. This album included a bilingual version of Engler i sneen (Angels in the Snow) and two more songs co-written by Fjeld, When Morning Comes to America and Blue Hotel.
