I’m older now, I have a child, a career. Everything is essentially great to the eye but I’ve sincerely missed doing what I do best- playing music. By resurrecting my own personal project that I started 20 years ago, I’m finally making it happen on my own terms and under my own rules. My back is fixed and I’m playing better than I ever have. Here we come.”
