"Harold Joseph Singer was born in Greenwood, an African American district of Tulsa, Oklahoma to father Charles and mother Anna Mae. His father was employed by an oil drilling tools manufacturer and his mother was a caterer. He was a survivor of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre during which his family's home was burnt down. Singer and his mother were helped to travel to Kansas City during the riot by his mother's white employer. There they waited out the violence with family until they could return. The official records of Singer's birth were destroyed during the violence. Singer studied violin as a child but later switched to reed instruments. He ultimately settled on the tenor saxophone influenced by hearing Ben Webster and Lester Young. On the advice of his father to pursue a ""proper"" career, Singer attended the Hampton Institute and graduated in 1939 with a degree in agriculture. While studying, Singer regularly took time off to tour with local bands.

"From the late 1930s Singer began performing in local bands, including Ernie Fields', before joining Jay McShann's orchestra in 1943 and then moving to New York. After working in other bands, he joined Oran ""Hot Lips"" Page's band in 1947 and began working as a session musician with King Records.

"In early 1948, he left Page, formed his own small group, and was signed to Mercury Records where he cut his first single ""Fine As Wine"" with a B side ""Rock Around the Clock"" (not the same tune as the Bill Haley recording), co-written with Sam Theard. For the Savoy label, he recorded the instrumental ""Corn Bread"", which made No. 1 on the R&B charts in September 1948, and raised Singer's profile and his nickname. His follow-up the following year, ""Beef Stew"", was a much smaller hit.
