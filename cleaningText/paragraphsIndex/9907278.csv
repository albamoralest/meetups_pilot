"His music exists in almost all genres, including solo and chamber music, orchestral music, music for theatre and film, pop, hip-hop, jazz, as well as electro-acoustic music. His works always tend to favour the bizarre or fantastical elements of the imagination and his pieces always tend to look for a new form of expression, whether through turntables in an orchestra, to live electro-acoustic music for electric bass and turntables, to kitchen utensils as musical instruments. A fascination with Hip Hop music and culture, as well as the historical interest in many other musical forms (Jazz, Soul, Funk) and his interest in Film, has been a strong influence on his music.

"At the age of 20 he wrote his first symphony – Symphony No 1 for Orchestra and Turntables (which has been performed by the APO, NZSO, WYO, DYO and NZSSSO). This is the first symphony to be written including modern turntablist techniques. He also released his first album through his production and pop music identity of ONE FAT MAN. The album 'a typical day in suburbia' received excellent reviews. It features styles that span the musical continuum from jazz to pop, to soul and hip hop. The album featured a range of local performers from Remy's home town of Hamilton, NZ. It contains tracks by local singers (Stephie Christian, Linda Dee, Landy Tyrell, Silua Fifita); rappers (Hitz, Ptt); and instrumentalists (Mike Mello, Rat Daddy, James Sutherland, Black C).
