"Robert Earle Spencer (born 26 June 1925 Welborn, Kansas – 19 September 1973 Fillmore, Utah) was an American trombonist and leader of a progressive swing big band bearing his name — Earle Spencer and His Orchestra.  He formed the band in 1946 and disbanded in 1949.  The band recorded for Black & White Records — a label so named by its founder, Les Schreiber, to reflect the races of its recording artists.

",1,== History of the Earle Spencer Orchestra ==
"Spencer was a trombonist who, after playing in the band that he led from 1946 to 1949, gave up playing entirely, due partly to a heart murmur, due partly to the hard economics of big bands in that began in the late 1940s, and due partly to the band's record label, Black & White Records, which went out of business in October 1949.
",2,== History of the Earle Spencer Orchestra ==
"Towards the end of World War II, a conscious movement towards the creation of a new style of big band jazz became apparent on America's west coast. The longest established of these self-styled ""progressives"" was Stan Kenton; then came Boyd Raeburn, and finally Earle Spencer. In 1946, Spencer formed his band in Los Angeles after being discharged from the U.S. Navy. Its compositions were progressively styled in the spirit of Stan Kenton, Johnny Richards, and Boyd Raeburn.  High-note trumpeter Al Killian, trombonist Tommy Pederson, tenorman Lucky Thompson, trumpeter Buddy Childers and altoist Art Pepper, were among the notable members.  Spencer apparently dropped out of music altogether by the end of 1949 – when he was still just 23 – and nothing much has been heard from him since. When Kenton was in his Artistry in Rhythm phase, Earle Spencer was running a roadshow version of the same thing. The evidence is on Concert in Jazz,  Tops 1532, dimmed by relatively inadequate recording. The March 5, 1949 Billboard magazine listed the Earle Spencer Orchestra as a ""B"" Band — one that grossed less than $200,000, but more than $100,000 during 1948.  Its booking agent firm was General Artist Corporation. Big bands were finding it difficult to survive in the late 1940s and were faced with limited bookings; so Spencer disbanded after a gig in Dallas. Edward Franklin Gabel (""Gabe;"" 1924–2014) left Kenton as Kenton's bandboy to work for Earle Spencer as manager in 1947.

"""Box Lunch (at the Factory),"" arranged by Paul Nelson (Black & White 875–A): The always interesting Earle Spencer has a potent, futuristic, impressionist work here.  Complex working, stratospheric brass figures, intricate rhythms, and a terrific scream trumpet chorus make this a sure bet for amateurs of the super modern.

For example, Bob Lively is listed on alto sax along with Art Pepper. The personnel listed here are found in the Lord discography and the liner notes to Fresh Sound 2501. According to jazz historian Noal Cohen, Geller remembers being on this session: ""I remember that because it was the first time I met and played with Art Pepper. It was around 1947, and perhaps my first recording as a sideman,"" — email from Geller to jazz historian Noal Cohen, October 4, 2011. The 1947 date is mentioned in other sources including the famous 11-volume Jepsen Jazz Discographies, but seems unlikely given the number of Stan Kenton musicians present (Childers, Pepper, Almeida, Betts). Historian Cohen feels that 1949 is more reasonable because Kenton had disbanded in late 1948 after which these musicians joined Spencer (reported in Down Beat Magazine).
