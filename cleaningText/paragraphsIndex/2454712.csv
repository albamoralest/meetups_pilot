"After the demise of Far, Jonah began to perform with a tape recorder and touring under the name onelinedrawing, which had been the name of a cassette he had released on Kevin Seconds's Pop Rockit Records. He released two EPs in 1999 (Sketchy EPs #1 and #2) of bedroom demos. He put out two further EPs in 2001 – ""Always New JanJun00"" and ""Always New JulDec00"".
",6,== Biography == | === Solo career and New End Original ===
"In 2000, he formed and fronted New End Original, a band that primarily formed full-band versions of onelinedrawing songs. With the lineup completed by Texas Is The Reason alumni Scott Winegard (bass) and Norman Arenas (guitar), and drummer Charlie Walker (ex-Chamberlain), they released one album Thriller and a single for Lukewarm.
",7,== Biography == | === Solo career and New End Original ===
"Much of his solo material has also been self-released, though often subsequently distributed through labels such as Crank! and Corrupted Image. However, his two full-length onelinedrawing albums, Visitor (2002) -a mixed bag of acoustic-based home recordings spanning a few years- and The Volunteers (2004) were released by Jade Tree Records.
",8,== Biography == | === Solo career and New End Original ===
"The Volunteers possessed a more polished sound – courtesy of mixer Dave Sardy, who had previously worked with Matranga on Far's Water and Solutions.
",9,== Biography == | === Solo career and New End Original ===
"Matranga retired the onelinedrawing moniker in 2004 and now intends to put all future solo releases under his name. In December 2004, Jonah began offering custom-made recordings of songs by himself or others through his website, in order to offer a one-of-a-kind musical artpiece. Information about this and his many other ideas can be found on Matranga's website, where he can also be contacted personally.
",10,== Biography == | === Solo career and New End Original ===
"In 2005, Matranga put out Sketchy EP #3, as well as a DVD, There's a Lot in Here, both of which are available on a sliding scale (""pay what you can"") from ([1]) Matranga's personally-maintained online store. The DVD There's a Lot in Here was re-released with a bonus CD on February 21, 2006, through Equal Vision Records.
",11,== Biography == | === Solo career and New End Original ===
"Matranga's song ""Crush on Everyone"" was featured in the score to the 2008 John Humber film Dakota Skye and ""Got My List"" was sung by the movie's protagonists.

"Jonah has contributed backup vocals to War All the Time (by Thursday) on the track ""Steps Ascending"", and to the Deftones's acoustic remix version of ""Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)"" and a cover of Sade's song ""No Ordinary Love"", both of which the Deftones released as b-sides (also, several Deftones members contributed to Far's cover of the Jawbox song ""Savory"").
",14,== Biography == | === Guest appearances ===
"He has also contributed to previous Matt Nathanson releases, a song called ""Swamp"" for tweaker (a.k.a. Chris Vrenna, former member of Nine Inch Nails), which ended up a b-side for the album The Attraction to All Things Uncertain, and to two Fort Minor songs for the album The Rising Tied: ""Red to Black"" with Kenna; and the single ""Where'd You Go"" with Holly Brook, where he also appears in the video. ""Where'd You Go"" managed to reach the #4 spot at the Billboard Hot 100.
",15,== Biography == | === Guest appearances ===
"Matranga's name does not appear on the title card before and after the video, though he is credited on the album. He attributed his video anonymity (jokingly) to his name being too long and ""music biz yuck"". He often expresses his negative opinion of the music industry's business ethics.

"In 2005 he co-wrote ""Calling"" for Taproot, the first single from their album Blue-Sky Research. He also appeared on Food & Liquor, the debut album for Lupe Fiasco, on the track entitled ""The Instrumental"", which appeared on the Madden 07 soundtrack. Jonah sings a hook (""And he never lied, 'cause he never said anything at all"") directly taken from the lyrics from ""Nestle"", a song from the Far album Water & Solutions. The track was produced by Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park and Fort Minor.
