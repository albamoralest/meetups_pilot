"Yuri began her musical career at 19 years old when she appeared on the idol talent program Asayan. She advanced to the finals, signed to Avex's Cutting Edge label, and released her first single, “PARADISE”, in early 1997. Soon after releasing the single, she met record producer t-kimura (Takashi Kimura) and rapper motsu (Mototaka Segawa), and together, the trio formed the band m.o.v.e in the summer of 1997. The trio are best known for the opening and closing themes of anime Initial D. Largely distancing herself from the public eye after m.o.v.e disbanded, she began working on solo work in 2018, and released her first solo album, “Eternity”, in July 2019.
