"Goren was born in The Bronx, New York City, but grew up in Oreland, Pennsylvania with his friend Brian Sokel, an inspiration for many of his songs. He played in several local bands as a youth. In 1991, Goren joined the punk band Fracture, and he remained with them until 1995. While Goren was still in school, friend and musician Andrew Dick introduced him to music sequencers, and he began writing music with one in his spare time. Later he started performing shows under the moniker Atom & His Package, consisting of himself, a B.C. Rich guitar, and his QY700 music sequencer, although exactly what ""the package"" consisted of changed throughout the years as Goren cycled through various sequencers and laptops.

"The songs of Atom and His Package generally consist of punk rock music put together with a sequencer and guitar. A few songs are purely instrumental, and as Goren's career went on, he started writing occasional songs that were more introspective or political in nature, yet still retained his classic tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and sarcastic wit. In a documentary on the Hair:Debatable DVD, Goren is on record explaining that he writes about whatever he happens to be thinking about at the time, whether its observations of the world around him, events that happen to him, or people he is close to.
