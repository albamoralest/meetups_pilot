"After disbanding Northstar, Roberts recorded a twelve track demo, ""Brother Down"", which formed the basis for the EP, The Inhuman Condition released in 2002. Recorded with Jordon Zadorozny, Roberts ""recorded a song a day"". Roberts signed with artist manager Dave Spencer and began to perform live. With the assistance of Linda Bush at Universal Music Publishing Canada, he signed a publishing contract with UMPG and a record contract with MapleMusic Recordings. MapleMusic released the six track EP culled from the demo with Roberts noting that ""it is not something I had intended to be my first real foray into the music world but I couldn't turn my back on such a chance"". It included two breakthrough singles, ""Brother Down"" (released in mid-2002) and ""Don't Walk Away Eileen"" (released in late 2002) which were heavily promoted in the Canadian market.
