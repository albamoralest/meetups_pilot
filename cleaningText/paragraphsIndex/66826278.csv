"Fernández returned to Chile in 1971. He moved to Santiago where he recorded his music and shared the stage several times with Victor Jara. He was also active with the Juventudes Comunistas de Chile. However, unlike other singers of the Nueva Canción Chilena, Fernández also had followers within the military and right wing. After the military coup in 1973, he was assigned to deliver Victor Jara's wedding ring to his widow. Fernández was himself detained by the military after the coup and imprisoned for a short time at the Escuela de Aviación, where he had studied in his youth. He was given the work of being a waiter serving the military personnel at the school. He was released after a short time and remained in Chile rather than living in exile. However, he was not permitted to perform live, and his more left-wing albums were censored. Over the years, he became close to members of the Central Nacional de Informaciones (CNI). This led to disagreements with artists of the Nueva Canción Chilena who no longer considered him to be part of their musical movement. Fernández claims to have had an encounter with UFOs on a highway while traveling to Antogagasta in 1974. In 1988, he founded the Centro Integral de Estudios Metafísicos (CIEM). In 2018, a member of CIEM accused Fernández of raping her. He was charged with rape in July 2020.
