"Redman was born and raised in Watford, England. The family had moved to a small commuter town named Chorleywood when he was around the age of two. His father died when he was just seven years old, and he and his brother were raised predominantly by his mother. His mother later remarried into an abusive relationship that took a great toll on the family. At the age of 10, he converted to Christianity after attending a mission service by Luis Palau at London's QPR football stadium and was encouraged by Mike Pilavachi, an Anglican Church youth leader to lead worship in his teens. He married Beth Redman, who is also a songwriter and author. The couple have five children.
