"Originally from Montreal, Silver became interested in electronic music at an early age. Self-taught, he cites Peter Gabriel, DJ Shadow, the Yellow Magic Orchestra and Talk Talk as important influences. His first 7"" single ""You Hear Colours"" / ""Invitation to Love"" was released on March 8, 2009, on the Acéphale label. The title of his first EP Panesian Nights was chosen in reference to the developer of Japanese erotic video games. In addition to his own recordings, Silver has also remixed songs for other artists, including Holy Ghost!, Crystal Castles, Sally Shapiro, The Presets, Health, Azari & III, Harald Grosskopf and Owen Pallett.
