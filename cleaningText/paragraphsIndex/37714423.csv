"Peaking Lights are a husband-and-wife music duo who met in San Francisco in 2006 and moved to Spring Green, Wisconsin in December 2007 where they lived until 2009. The couple then moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where they stayed until their return to the West Coast in 2011 to live in Los Angeles. Currently they are based in Amsterdam. Peaking Lights' music has been described as psychedelic pop. The band originally formed in 2008, performing live in order to fund a road trip to Texas, at which point they self-released the cd-r Clearvoiant (later released on cassette via Night-People). The couple's son Mikko contributed vocals to their third album, Lucifer. In 2013 their second son Marlon was born.
