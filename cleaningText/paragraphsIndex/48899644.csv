"In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, area school districts reduced funding to music programs, specifically middle schools. Rebirth Brass Band member, Derrick Tabb and Allison Reinhardt co-founded The Roots of Music, a non-profit after-school program for Orleans Parish at-risk children ages 9–14. The students are mentored in music by local New Orleans music educators and professional musicians. Academic mentoring and tutoring is provided by volunteers and graduate students from Tulane and Xavier universities. Tabb stated that his goal in starting Roots was ""to do for a new generation of kids what his own middle school band did for him.""Monday through Thursday, the organization's school buses pick up students from 40 Orleans Parish middle schools and transports them to its facility in the Tremé neighborhood in New Orleans. For the first hour and a half, the students receive homework assistance and academic tutoring by volunteers. After homework, the students receive music instruction and field practice. Before the students are transported home via school bus after practice, the students receive a hot meal. The program is entirely free for the students and relies wholly on private and corporate donations and volunteers to cover operating expenses.

"On October 1, 2007, Derrick Tabb and his brother, trombonist Glen David Andrews, were arrested for ""parading without a permit"" and ""disturbing the peace by tumultuous manner"" in the Tremé neighborhood of New Orleans during a gathering honoring fellow musician, Kerwin James. James, the younger brother of Rebirth founders, Phil and Keith Frazier, had died following complications from a stroke in 2006. A crowd of musicians and spectators had gathered to honor James in music and song that night. Police officers, after asking the crowd the disperse and being refused, arrested Tabb and Andrews. This incident, witnessed by resident news journalists, stirred the small community and sparked outcry against the police department, as street parades are inherent to the history and culture of New Orleans. The community, viewing the pair of brothers as advocates for their voice in the city, dubbed the pair with the nickname, ""The Tremé Two"". After several weeks of unrest and protest by neighborhood residents to the New Orleans Police Department and city council, in February 2008, the District Attorney dropped the charges without comment. A fictional adaption of the incident featuring Tabb and Andrews as themselves was incorporated into an episode of the HBO television series, Treme (Season 3, Episode 1, Knock with Me, Rock with Me).
