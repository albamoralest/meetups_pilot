"Yasuno was born in Miyagi Prefecture on July 9, 1989. About a week after she was born, her family moved to Hakodate, and after some time they moved back to Miyagi Prefecture. From an early age, she had an interest in anime, particularly after watching Sailor Moon and Magic Knight Rayearth as a child. She became aware of voice acting at a young age, while watching the anime series Saint Tail. To further her interest, she watched videos of dubs being recorded. During her sixth year of elementary school, Yasuno moved to Tokyo. In high school, she became part of her school's theater club. Although she had been looking for a voice acting school, her parents told her that they would allow her to pursue a voice acting career only if she paid with her own money. Around that time, the talent agency Avex was holding auditions for its voice acting school, so she decided to apply. She passed the audition and began attending voice acting school. She played a number of background roles in anime beginning in 2009, and in 2011 played her first lead role as Kizuna Todoroki, the protagonist of the anime Kizuna Ichigake, which was produced as part of the Young Animator Training Project. Yasuno continued voicing primarily supporting roles until 2013, when she was cast as the character Sakura Kitaōji in the multimedia franchise Aikatsu! The following year, she played the roles of Tina Kobayakawa in Wake Up, Girls! and Yuko Tachikawa in Parasyte. In 2015, she was cast as Megumi Katō, the main heroine of the anime series Saekano: How to Raise a Boring Girlfriend. That year, she also voiced Kaori Murasaki in Triage X and Mayuko Inoue in Ushio and Tora. In 2015, she joined the popular idol multimedia franchise iDOLM@STER, taking on the role of  THE iDOLM@STER CINDERELLA GIRLS character Natsuki Kimura and has attended many of the franchise's live concerts to represent the character.
