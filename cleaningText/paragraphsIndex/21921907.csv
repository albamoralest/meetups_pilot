"Reith's musical career began when he released an independent album, Urgent Message, in 2003. Christian singer and Gotee Records manager TobyMac discovered his music in 2006. TobyMac reportedly pulled his car off to the side of the road when he first heard Reith's music, later stating: ""Brian is just naturally gifted from God vocally and his lyrics [...] sort of just ease into your heart."" In 2008, Reith signed to Gotee Records and released his EP The Forecast in May 2008. At the end of the year, he guested on TobyMac's annual 2008 Winter Wonder Slam tour, which ran through November and December 2008.
