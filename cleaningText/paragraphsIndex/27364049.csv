"MX Machine was formed in 1985 by bass guitarist Diego Negrete with vocalist Lee Kaiser, guitarist Mitch Rellas and local drummer Sam Monarez. Drummer Danny Anaya (formally of Abbitior) joined soon after and the original MX Machine started. The band's first demo, ""Fatal Mistake"", was produced by Bill Metoyer. The demo and a few sold out Hollywood shows led them to sign with Sharon Murley and Restless Records in 1987.

"They released their first album, Manic Panic, in 1988, gaining critical recognition and touring in support of the album Manic Panic. MX Machine became notorious in the Los Angeles underground scene for wildly staged drunken antics and powerful fast three-minute songs. They quickly rose to popularity but were banned from most local clubs at the same time, which became a problem as no promoters wanted to book the act for fear of destroyed property. So the ""AfterParty"" became a common practice. Songs from the album made it to the large screen with ""Psychotic Killing Machine"" used in the soundtrack to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. ""Kick You In The Face"" appeared in the feature Under The Boardwalk. After the tour, MX Machine began work on a new album in 1989 for Restless, but the results of these sessions remain unreleased as the record contract was dissolved and MX Machine disbanded. Soon later John Ayala a drummer from other bands like Lace and Bastard Son joined the band, during his short journey they  played at the House of Blues in Los Angeles.
