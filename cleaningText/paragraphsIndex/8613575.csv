"Martin Gold (December 26, 1915 â€“ January 14, 2011) was an American composer, pianist, and bandleader born in New York City, New York, United States. He was the pianist and arranger for the Korn Kobblers, a popular 1940s novelty group billed as ""America's most nonsensical dance band"", but was probably best known as the composer of the song ""Tell Me Why"", which was a hit for The Four Aces in 1951.

While at RCA, he had the distinction of playing on pre-Columbia signed Barbra Streisand's RCA audition demo in March, 1962.
