"Hudson was born in Grimsby, Ontario, March 8, 1908. Print-media biographies state that he was born in Barstow, California. However, Hudson's U.S. Naturalization application indicates otherwise. Grimsby, then of Lincoln County, the county of which, in 1970, became amalgamated into a county-like governmental body known as the Regional Municipality of Niagara. Hudson, with his parents, immigrated to the United States November 13, 1909 — at the age of 1 year, 8 months.  He grew up in Detroit and graduated from Southeastern High School in June 1926. Hainer put together his first big band in Detroit in the early 1930s. Hudson became a United States citizen on April 14, 1941.

"Biographical sources for Will Hudson (né Arthur Murray Hainer; March 8, 1908 Grimsby, Ontario –  July 16, 1981 Isle of Palms, South Carolina) often incorrectly state that he was born in Barstow, California.  He changed his name sometime between 1931 and 1933 — after his marriage to Eleanor Radtke (born 1912) in Detroit on August 15, 1931, and before his compositions were copyrighted under his new name.

"At some point during the early 1930s, Hudson became a staff arranger for Irving Mills, writing stock arrangements.  Mills — notable in various roles in the development of swing and jazz — was as much a promoter of songwriters, arrangers, and big bands as he was a publisher.  Mills was known to have included his name as co-author of works that he did not write, but published. This was a common method of including music promoters in royalties.

"Hudson was a dance-band arranger, and co-leader with Eddie DeLange of the Hudson-DeLange Orchestra. Singers with the Hudson-DeLange Orchestra included Ruth Gaylor, in 1936; Mitchell Ayres (né Meyer Agress; 1910–1969), in 1937; Georgia Gibbs (formerly Fredda Gibson; née Frieda Lipschitz; 1919–2006); and Nan Wynn. When the Hudson-DeLange Orchestra was at the height of its popularity, around 1940, Hudson had to withdraw for health reasons. Hudson led his own band, the Will Hudson Orchestra, from 1939 to about 1941. Singers included Kay Kenny; Elisse Cooper, who, in 1944 married saxophonist Joseph Gabriel ""Gabe"" Gelinas; Jayne Dover (née Jane Rappaport), while signing with Van Alexander Orchestra; and Ruth Gaylor.
