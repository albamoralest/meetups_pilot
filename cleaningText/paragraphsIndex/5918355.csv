"Samuel Lloyd ""Sam"" Duckworth (born 30 January 1986) is an English musician who performs as Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly. He is also sometimes referred to as Get Cape, Cape, GCWCF and Slam Dunkworth (the latter title apparently first coined by Emmy the Great). According to Duckworth, his original stage name came from Retro Gamer magazine, from an article about superhero games such as Batman containing the heading ""Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly"", although a Calvin & Hobbes cartoon by Bill Watterson has also been cited. In addition to the Get Cape name, and his given name, Duckworth has released music under the moniker Recreations.

"Duckworth grew up in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. Get Cape was signed to Atlantic Records in March 2006, after playing many gigs, both with punk rock band Silverskin and as Get Cape. As Get Cape, Duckworth has collaborated with Billy Bragg, Nitin Sawhney, Shlomo, Killa Kela, Baba Maal, Flea, Kate Nash and many others with his participation in many events for Africa Express. Duckworth co-organised The Demolition Ball – the last night at the London Astoria venue before it was knocked down in January 2009. He had previously headlined at the Astoria for his 21st birthday party. After 10 years, Duckworth decided to end Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly and to continue making under his own name. The ""last ever"" show under the Get Cape moniker was held at The Forum, Kentish Town on 12 September 2014. In May 2017, Duckworth announced that he was resurrecting the Get Cape name, with the release of the single Optimist, and subsequently announced a new full-length album, Young Adult, due for release in January 2018.
