"The most famous of Raoul's songs is unquestionably Quant li rossignols jolis (""When the pretty nightingales""), which is probably the song Johannes de Grocheo (c.1300) describes as a cantus coronatus (crowned, meaning probably that it had received a prize in a competition). Unfortunately, this song is ascribed to the Chastelain de Couci in another manuscript. It was used as a model for the anonymous L'autrier m'iere rendormis. Musically, it starts at the upper octave, flows downwards, and establishes a centre on d.

"All of Raoul's melodies, including Quant li rossignols, were recorded in bar form, save two readings Si sui du tout a fine Amour (possibly later revisions). None are recorded in mensural notation. Most of the melodies are in the D modes (authentic and plagal), but three are in the authentic G mode. Poetically, all but one of Raoul's compositions use the ABABBAAB rhyme scheme and all of his works are also octosyllabic, with the heptasyllabic exceptions of Quant ivers a tel poissance and Quant li rossignols and the mixed octo- and heptasyllabic verses of the disputed Quant il ne pert fueille ne flours.
