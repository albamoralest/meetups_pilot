"Meg Lee Chin was born on 16 March 1960 in Taipei, Taiwan, to a US Air Force electronics engineer and a Taiwanese mother. She worked as a sound engineer while studying experimental art and video production at San Francisco State University, forming her first band, Felix Natural, during the early 1980s. Chin went on to co-found the short-lived Teknofear with Lunachicks drummer Becky Wreck and Swans guitarist Joe Goldring; frustrated with American life, she spent the late 1980s living in London, and eventually formed the all-female band Crunch. Crunch had the distinction of being one of the first Western bands to perform in Ukraine just after the breakup of the U.S.S.R. After the tour the band gifted their Russian hosts with a DAT tape of an album's worth of their music to be distributed throughout the USSR copyright free. She has been recording since her college days in San Francisco, when she recorded Faith No More's first-ever demo on her 4-track, and the vocalist was briefly one Ms Courtney Love. In 1990, her home-produced music video entitled ""The Ocean"" was featured on MTV Europe's regular rotation. It may have been the first MTV Europe music video to be home-produced in super8 and transferred to video on a budget of £200. When asked by the producer how she managed to create a £200 video which was in his opinion ""better than Duran Duran's £200,000 videos"", Chin simply replied, ""I've got pretty good taste"". The video was later featured in an Institute of Contemporary Arts festival of film shorts.

"After appearing on Pigface's 1997 LP A New High in Low as well as its follow-up, Below the Belt, in 1999 she released the solo debut Piece and Love on ex-Public Image Ltd, Ministry and Killing Joke drummer Martin Atkins' Invisible Records label. Recorded in her Soho, London flat and released in September, ""Piece and Love"" achieved critical acclaim on the darkwave, industrial underground scene and was hot-tipped in Billboard (magazine) magazine's ""Heatseaker"" section. The album peaked at #60 on the CMJ Radio 200 in the U.S. The track ""Nutopia"" paints an apocalyptic vision of the future as a twist on Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Howl"". Other tracks have appeared on Showtime's ""Queer as Folk"", Warner Bros. Records ""Witchblade""  and ""Sleeper Cell"". An album of remixes, titled Junkies and Snakes, was released the following year again on Invisible Records.

"Chin's work has become increasingly political. In 2014 she released an anti-war music video using Vietnam-era war footage. ""I Can't Pull the Trigger"" was produced by Chin in London, England. Chin has released 5 homegrown music videos.[2] True to her DIY underground ethic Meg produced, filmed, directed, and edited all videos and music. A highly controversial political video ""England's Mask"" was featured in a talk at the Tate Gallery in London where she appeared on a panel of artists speaking on the topic ""Artists Explore Brexit"". In 2019, she created a political documentary/cartoon entitled ""England's Mask"" which expands upon the song of the same name. The video demonstrates why Britain is in danger of losing its status as global creative leaders in street art, fashion and pop music. Solutions include an unconditional basic income, land tax, legal reform and doing away with income tax and VAT by taking money printing powers away from central banks and allowing the government to print the cost of running the country. Chin created a genre called ""Word Drops"" which are short spoken word and commentary pieces, often of a political nature and mixed with an assortment of beats and sound effects.
