"Sledge was born on March 28, 1994 where she was raised on the South Side of the Chicago, Illinois. Throughout her childhood, Sledge  moved to a number of locations throughout the city of Chicago. To escape issues that a number of teens face (blended families, constantly having new friends, and problems at home) Sledge looked into the fine arts, which helped her deal with some of the realities of her life. She explored scatting, poetry writing, and drifted towards singing at the age of 10. Sledge always felt like music was her internal escapism, and by the age of 14, she found interest in becoming a rapper. Sledge has cited rappers J. Cole and Lil Wayne as her biggest musical influences, referring to the former as her favourite rapper of all time. Sledge was putting more time into rapping, she became good friends with fellow Chicago native rapper Sasha Go Hard, and made a guest appearance on Sasha's song, ""I Ain't No Hitta"" in 2012. Sledge later released a song with a fellow rapper Lil Durk, called ""Ghost"". In February 2013, Sledge released a collaborative mixtape with fellow Chicago native rapper Mikey Dollaz, titled Business N Pleasure. In February 2014, she released her first solo mixtape, titled Schizo through AOE Music, along with a song, which features guest verse from a fellow Chicago rapper Common, called ""No Good"".
