"As a composer, his music is complex and rich, which allows him to demonstrate his playing ability. He has composed a large number of pieces for one of his best artistic partners, Carmen Cortés. He also made a version of El Amor Brujo, for four guitars, and he has attempted fusion with other kinds of music, especially jazz, but without ever leaving out flamenco as its foundation.
