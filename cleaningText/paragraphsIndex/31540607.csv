"Heart Healer is a project with the intention to create the first metal opera only with female singers, with Magnus Karlsson on songwriting and production. Self-named album Heart Healer released on 12 March 2021 via Frontiers Records. Current band members: Magnus Karlsson, Erika Sävström Engman, Daniel Tengberg, Anders Köllerfors
",11,== Biography == | === Heart Healer ===
"The invited singers are Adrienne Cowan (Seven Spires, Sascha Paeth's Masters of Ceremony, Avantasia, Winds of Plague), Netta Laurenne (Smackbound, Laurenne/Louhimo), Youmna Jreissati (Ostura), Ailyn (Her Chariot Awaits, ex-Sirenia), Noora Louhimo (Battle Beast), Margarita Monet (Edge of Paradise) and Anette Olzon (The Dark Element, ex-Nightwish). The album's plot follows the title character (performed by Cowan) after she wakes up with no memory and with the ability to heal people with the touch of her bare hands, though that comes at the gradual cost of her own strength. As the story progresses, she meets people wiling to help her, use her powers or hunt her. The album has been released on CD, color vinyl and digital formats. On 25 January 2021, a video for ""Into the Unknown"" was released. Karlsson explained in his words, ""my interest in orchestral music has been growing increasingly during the years. I wanted to mix the epic and dramatic orchestral sound with metal and produce something without any limits and rules. At the end of 2019, I started to work on ideas and tried new sounds and arrangements with the goal to create something dramatic, epic, and beautiful. This is easily my biggest and most demanding work ever. First the music with big arrangements and orchestra. Then all the singers and the need to find the right parts for everyone to make it as good as possible. Finally, mixing it all together in an interesting story about the 'heart healer'. I have to say, if I didn’t work with such great and professional people it would be impossible to make this happen!”
