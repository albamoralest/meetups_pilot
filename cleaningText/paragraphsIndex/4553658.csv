"Breedlove is the founder of the San Francisco based non-profit Homobiles, a California NPO 501c3 committed to providing secure and reliable transit to the SF Bay Area LGBTIQQ community and its allies. Homobiles is credited by Sidecar Co-Founder Sunil Paul as the first peer-to-peer ridesharing service in the United States and the inspiration for Sidecar's business model. Homobiles officially launched their donation-based community mutual aid service in 2011 after Breedlove first began giving rides in 2010 - to protect drag performers and people who didn't feel safe or wouldn't be picked up by traditional taxi services.
