"Marissa Nadler (born April 5, 1981) is an American musician and fine artist based in Boston, Massachusetts. Active since 2000, she is currently signed to Sacred Bones Records and Bella Union, and released her eighth full-length studio album, For My Crimes, in September 2018. As a singer-songwriter, her music has been characterized as blending ""traditional folk, Gothic Americana, and dreamy pop into an original musical framework"". Her music ""is rooted in old-school country and folk but brings in elements of experimental and black metal"". Sometimes the term ""dream folk"" has been invoked to describe her work. Singing in a mezzo-soprano, Nadler has received acclaim for her vocals. Her voice was described by Pitchfork as one ""you would follow straight into Hades"", and also ""textured and angelic, with just a hint of pain captured within her iridescent falsetto"". The Boston Globe said, ""She has a voice that, in mythological times, could have lured men to their deaths at sea, an intoxicating soprano drenched in gauzy reverb that hits bell-clear heights, lingers, and tapers off like rings of smoke"".

"Marissa Nadler was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Needham, Massachusetts. She was raised Jewish. As a teenager, she taught herself to play guitar in a style similar to fingerpicking, playing a steady bass pattern with the thumb and filling out syncopated rhythms with the index finger. It was described as having an ""unorthodox, dusky sound"". Also while in her teens, she began to write songs as a hobby. She studied painting at Rhode Island School of Design, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in illustration in 2003, and a master's degree in art education a year later. During her studies, she began to perform at open mic events around Providence. While exploring artistic techniques such as illustration, painting, bookbinding, wood carving and encaustic painting, she also honed her songwriting craft. She subsequently recorded an album titled Autumn Rose (2002) as well as the four-track EP Somber Ghost Recordings (2003), neither of which have ever been released. Nadler also contributed to the Pearl Before Swine tribute album For the Dead in Space - Volumes II & III in 2003.

Nadler's quiet songwriting and ethereal sound give July a sound that's, at times, almost sinister"". Steven Rosen of Blurt wrote that Nadler managed to achieve an ""almost-hallucinatory effect out of her singing, often multi-tracking the voice to create a ghostly pillowing effect"". In July 2014, Nadler collaborated with Father John Misty, releasing a split 7"" on Bella Union. Father John Misty covered Nadler's ""Drive"", while Nadler covered ""Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings"".

"Nadler's eighth studio album, For My Crimes, was released by Sacred Bones on September 28, 2018.

It was her first album cover to feature her fine art, an untitled painting. The album included guest vocals by Olsen, Sharon Van Etten and Kristin Kontrol. The album's first video, ""Blue Vapor"", was directed by Thomas McMahan, who ""utilizes various experimental and mixed media animation techniques, merging the mood and imagery of the song with hallucinatory visuals..."" Nadler's wardrobe in the video for ""Blue Vapor"" was created and put together by New York-based costume designer and stylist Jenni Hensler, who also styled Nadler's Pitchfork.tv performance clip for the song ""Dissolve.""

",20,== Music career == | === 2021: Instead of Dreaming and The Path of the Clouds ===
"Nadler released her ninth solo album, The Path of the Clouds on October 29, 2021. Like others, the album found its origins in the Covid-19 pandemic: “Gripped by wanderlust while suddenly housebound at the start of the pandemic in 2020, Nadler escaped into writing, and came back with a stunning set of songs about metamorphosis, love, mysticism, and murder."" A review from the magazine UNCUT notes that, ""[e]scape is a central theme of the album, and several songs recall historical cases of mysterious disappearances, but infused with personal experience, blurring the line between fact and fiction."" This self-produced album contains the most sonically elaborate work of her discography. Various guests make an appearance on The Path of the Clouds including harpist Mary Lattimore and former Cocteau Twins bassist Simon Raymonde. Emma Ruth Rundle contributes a guitar solo to “Turned into Air” and Amber Webber of Black Mountain provides backing vocals on “Elegy”. Milky Burgess played various instruments throughout the album. The Path of the Clouds has received critical acclaim. NME gave the album a positive review, writing, ""This is a departure for Nadler in a number of ways, with more sophisticated production, unusual storytelling, and a firm look ahead to her future as an artist (more piano, more power vocally)."" Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 7.5, comparing the album favourably to the true crime genre that inspired it: ""The thrills of The Path of the Clouds are far richer than most true crime fiction, but like the best examples of the genre, it leaves you breathless."" The album received four stars from  8/10 from UNCUT, MusicOMH, Rock n Reel, MOJO, and Record Collector. Other reviewers were even more positive, with All Music Guide (4 ½ stars) praising the “epic, aching songs, which refuse to keep tragedy at arm’s length” and Sputnikmusic (superb: 4.5) noting that it “sounds so lush, sweeping, and powerful that all the subtle, intricate melodies are merely the cherry on top.” In its five-star “essential” review, Contact Music called the album “exquisitely crafted and utterly beguiling” and recommended that, “The Path of the Clouds … should be listened to, uninterrupted, in its entirety.”
