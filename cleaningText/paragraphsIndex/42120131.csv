"A comedic rivalry between Darden and fellow accomplished radio personality Charlamagne tha God of Power 105.1 has been ongoing for years. In May 2017, Darden clarified their relationship, stating, ""The stuff we do on the radio is stupid. It's for fun. I make fun of you for fun. That's it. It's not that deep... me and that dude don't have a personal problem... a personal relationship"".
