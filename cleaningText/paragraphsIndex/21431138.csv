"Birchard is the son of actor and singer Paul Birchard. At the age of 15, Birchard (under the name DJ Itchy) was the youngest UK DMC finalist. His earliest gigs as a club DJ were with Glasgow University's Subcity Radio where he first appeared as part of the culture city kids show and later as part of other shows including Turntable Science with Pro Vinylist Karim and Cloudo's Happy Hardcore show, under the alias DJ Mayhem. During this period, Birchard formed the Lucky Me collective with childhood friends. He adopted the stage name ""Hudson Mohawke"" after seeing the name engraved on a statue in the hallway of his accommodation. In 2007, Birchard applied to the Red Bull Music Academy and was invited to attend the event in Toronto, where he first met Steve Beckett of Warp Records, who was giving a lecture there, and was to sign Hudson Mohawke two years later. In addition to his solo work, Hudson Mohawke collaborated with Mike Slott as Heralds of Change, releasing a series of 12"" EPs including Show You (2006), Sittin' on the Side (2007), Puzzles (2007) and Secrets (2007) on All City Records. Hudson Mo was also DJ/Producer for the now defunct hip hop group Surface Emp alongside MC's Dom Sum and sometimes 2 Can Dan. Surface Empire released the LuckyMe EP in 2005 on Far Cut Records.

"In 2008, Birchard met Canadian producer Lunice during the first LuckyMe Records tour of North America, with Hudson Mohawke performing at the Pop Montreal festival and Lunice playing support. Following a successful performance headlining Warp Records' 2012 SXSW showcase, the duo's collaborative project TNGHT debuted their TNGHT EP, released via Warp X LuckyMe on 23 July 2012. TNGHT has performed at multiple venues internationally, including The Opera House, the Coachella music festival and Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg, which featured an appearance by rapper/producer Kanye West during a remix of West's ""Cold"". In 2009, Hudson Mohawke signed to Warp Records, despite a very limited track record of official releases; in fact, the bulk of his releases were unofficial tracks and DJ mixes circulated on the Internet. His first official release to get major notice was entitled ""Spotted"" on the Rush Hour beat compilation Beat Dimensions Vol 1. In 2008 his 12"" EP Ooops! on LuckyMe/Wireblock became an underground sensation, particularly once word spread of his recording contract with Warp. In 2009, Hudson Mohawke released his first studio album, Butter. In that year, he contributed a cover of a Jimi Tenor song, titled ""Paint the Stars"", to the Warp20 (Recreated) compilation. He would follow with several EPs, including 2011's Satin Panthers. He produced the debut EP for UK band Egyptian Hip Hop at Club Ralph Studios in London, which was released in August 2010. One of his songs, ""100hm"", has been featured as a track on the video game Grand Theft Auto V, while ""Fuse"" was featured in Sleeping Dogs and Dirt 3.

"In 2012, Hudson Mohawke began a series of collaborations with Kanye West, resulting in production credits on the GOOD Music label album Cruel Summer.  On 17 January 2013, it was announced that Mohawke had officially signed with GOOD Music as a producer, whilst remaining with Warp and LuckyMe as a recording artist. TNGHT announced their hiatus on 27 December 2013. Mohawke co-produced two tracks on West's 2013 album Yeezus (""I Am a God"" and ""Blood on the Leaves"") and contributed to West's 2016 follow-up The Life of Pablo, in addition to working with various other hip hop and pop artists, including Drake, Pusha T, and Future. In 2015, he released his second studio album, Lantern. In 2016, he collaborated with singer Anohni on her 2016 album Hopelessness. Mohawke announced on 26 October 2016 via Twitter that he was creating the original soundtrack for the 2016 video game Watch Dogs 2 titled ""Ded Sec"" and that Warp Records would release it on 11 November 2016.

"Following early acclaim for his turntable work, Hudson Mohawke has gone on to receive praise for his ""genre-smashing"" production approach, in which styles of music are ""incorporated, manipulated and bounced against each other."" In 2009, during Birchard's debut Essential Mix, Pete Tong proclaimed ""Hudson Mohawke is doing for hip-hop what the Aphex Twin did for techno"". In 2011, The Guardian characterized his trademark sound as ""a vivid, psychedelic melange of J Dilla-esque instrumental hip hop, space-age R&B, bass boom and oldskool rave euphoria, garnished with effervescent FX from unexpected sources."" Following the formation of TNGHT, Birchard and partner Lunice attempted to strip down their production styles and avoid ""all over the place"" tracks. In 2015, Exclaim! wrote that ""in the six years since Glaswegian producer Hudson Mohawke released his debut full-length, Butter, Mohawke's music has gone from a glitch-y, turntablist jitter to a euphoric, multicolored trap-hop pound and everywhere in between.""
