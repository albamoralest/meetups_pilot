"In the 1980s, Paley was singer, front man, and writer for post-punk blues-band-from-hell The Five, which he founded in Pittsburgh, PA. In the first year of the band's existence The Five released limited pressings of a vinyl single ""Napalm Beach b/w Excite Me"" and an EP Act of Contrition. The band later moved to Boston and spent several years headlining clubs and playing to enthusiastic crowds before breaking up in the late 1980s. A vinyl LP entitled The Five was released posthumously.

"Returning to Brooklyn in the early 1990s, Paley continued writing and began performing solo in rock clubs on the Lower East Side, singing his songs and playing a 1955 Gretsch archtop guitar plugged into a 1965 Fender Super Reverb amplifier.

"After a series of self-released tapes available only at shows, Sub Pop released his solo debut, the vinyl single ""Time For You"" b/w ""The Best Of All"".  Paley's first solo album Lucky's Tune was produced by Frank Black (formerly and again Black Francis), and released by GoodNoise in 1999.  This was followed in 2000 by the album Revival, featuring Paley accompanied by Robert Lee Oliver on the three-string bass and James Murray on the trap kit, and produced by Eric Drew Feldman, who along with Jim Duffy also guests on the album. The album was released by eMusic, and is the first recorded appearance of the Reid Paley Trio.

"Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Paley played across the US and Western Europe, including numerous tours as support for Frank Black. Paley and Black have also collaborated on the writing of a number of songs, some of which appear on the Frank Black albums Honeycomb (""Another Velvet Nightmare""), Fast Man Raider Man (""I'm Not Dead (I'm in Pittsburgh)"", ""Golden Shore"", ""Dog Sleep"", ""Down To You""), and Christmass (""Don't Get Me Wrong""). A Frank Black & the Catholics recording of Paley's ""Take What You Want"" appears on their limited edition single ""Everything Is New.""

"""Everyone has a favorite drinking album, be it Sinatra's Only the Lonely or the Old 97's' Too Far to Care. Right now, mine is Revival (on emusic), the second full-length by Reid Paley."" – Seattle Weekly (Kurt B. Reighley)

"""Just another impossibly excellent piece of work flying low, under the radar...""—Ink 19 (James MacLaren)
",20,== Reviews ==
"""It's so distinctive that it takes a while for your listening organs to balance the gruff, hoarse voice with the excellent playing but the vocals fits perfectly with the honestly drunk blues of ‘Stay Awhile’ or the funny/profane ‘Yr Polish Uncle’. That song displays the other good thing about this record, the foul-mouthed and dark wit that produces lines like ""shut your mouth and you’ll piss yourself a story/ about the spastic monkey and the whore"" over a frenetic rock’n’roll rhythm that will have your spitting your dinner over the stereo in mirth."" – Sounds XP UK (Ged)

"""The Reid Paley Trio is simply rock and roll distilled to its purest form – a form that harkens back to when parents feared it, before Disney marketed it to pre-pubescents, before more people bought video games simulating playing a guitar than actually picked up a recording of someone playing a guitar..""—Jezebel Music (Brian Salvatore)
",22,== Reviews ==
"""So many critics wax how Reid Paley is underrated, undiscovered talent – but it's actually true. He's an immensely talented singer-guitarist-songwriter. When you listen to that subtly swinging rock and his deep bellow, it's easy to tell something special is afoot. This is the ""real thing"", but it doesn't comfortably fit in any category to reach the masses."" --Cheap Thrills (Rob V)Paley & Francis

"""Their voices and dark humor blend wonderfully—Francis' mid-range singing lifts Paley's deeper, more resonant sound, and the former's wit and word play are anchored by the other's irony and sarcasm...every song's a gem.""  – - Valley Advocate

"""Despite the speed with which they were written and recorded the album never feels rushed or half hearted. There is a clear chemistry between the pair and without it they would not be able to pull off an album of this calibre in such a short space of time ...a strangely compelling listen."" – - Tape to Tape UK
