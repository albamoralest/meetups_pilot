"John Molo was born in Bethesda, Maryland of mostly Irish descent. His surname is Swiss-Italian but his other three grandparents all emigrated from Ireland. He was raised Catholic in Washington, D.C.. His father was an oceanographer who became increasingly concerned about the safety of the inner city and, when Molo was 12, the family moved to suburban Virginia, where Molo attended Langley High School in nearby McLean, Virginia. While at Langley Molo played in the school's nationally renowned jazz ensemble, the Langley High Jazz Lab, under the direction of band director George Horan.
