"Karie moved to Tokyo after graduating high school and entered a vocational college to study photography. After graduating college, she made a short career as a freelance photographer. In the late 1980s, Karie became an avid listener of French musicians such as Serge Gainsbourg, Françoise Hardy, and Jane Birkin, who would serve as formative influences on her own music. In 1990, at the suggestion of her then-boyfriend Keigo Oyamada (later known as Cornelius), Karie began her musical career performing vocals for a house band signed to his friend's record label. She later performed vocals alongside Takako Minekawa as the duo Fancy Face Groovy Name. In 1992, Karie issued her first solo single, ""Mike Alway's Diary"", which was produced by Oyamada. At this time she was referred to as ""Shibuya-kei Princess"", and her personal relationship with Oyamada was highly publicized.

(1998) and Tilt (2000) for Crue-L Records and Polydor Records, working with a variety of collaborators, including Momus and Philippe Katerine. In 2003, Karie released her fourth studio album Trapeziste on her new record label Victor Entertainment. The album found Karie pursuing a more experimental musical direction.
