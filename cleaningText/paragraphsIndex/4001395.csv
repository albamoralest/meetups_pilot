"Williams was born in Baltimore, Maryland on March 17, 1948. She started playing the piano at age four, began music lessons with a private teacher at five, and at age seven was enrolled into the Peabody Preparatory. She studied classical music and ear training with Richard Aitken and George Bellows at the Peabody Conservatory of Music.

"Williams showed an ability to see each note's color as she heard it, consistent with synesthesia. She discussed how this inspired her early interest in the piano in a televised interview with the BBC. Williams also had the ability to play anything she heard. At age twelve she was listening to Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Charles Mingus. She knew she was destined to become a jazz pianist.

"Williams began performing jazz in her teens, playing with Richie Cole, Buck Hill, and Mickey Fields. In a rare radio interview with Marian McPartland on NPR's Piano Jazz, she states that her main influences were not pianists, but horn players, most notably Miles Davis and John Coltrane.
