"The industrial rock band Stayte was co-founded by guitarist/programmer Clayton and singer/lyricist Joshua Bradford in 1997. They released Growing Pains on Nefer Records in 1999.

They collaborated in 2005 with Ministry's Paul Barker on an EP titled Cognitive Dissonance – The Art of Lying to Yourself. Originally destined for a 2008 release on 13th Planet, The Two Sisters was finally released in 2010 on Spiralchords in Europe and independently in North America.
