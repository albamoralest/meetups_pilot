"Silvestre Francisco Dangond Corrales (born May 12, 1980 in Urumita) is a Colombian singer. He attributes his talents to his father, the singer William José ""El Palomo"" Dangond Baquero, who during the mid-1970s recorded 10 singles with Andrés ""El Turco"" Gil; and his mother, who comes from a musical family and passed down her charismatic nature to him, while also playing a major role in his formal and personal education.

"By pure coincidence and through friend in common, manager and promoter Carlos Blum, Dangond officially met accordionist Juancho De la Espriella during a serenata (De la Espriella was grouped with singer Peter Manjarrez). Both of them knew who the other was but had never crossed words. Since that day they became good friends. Blum then convinced them to become a musical duo and arranged their first gig together at the Alfonso López Michelsen Building in a celebration of the Cesar Department foundation.
