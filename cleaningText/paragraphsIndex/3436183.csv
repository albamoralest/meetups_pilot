"He has a high baritone type voice and possesses almost 4 octave vocal range, with a melodic and aggressive vocal, always using the voice mix, a common technique in the musical style, but with a lot of drive, giving the impression of a torn voice in heavy songs, and a soft voice in slow songs.

"Deris was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, and started to sing in his first band, Paranoid, when he was 15. Two years later, they changed the band's name to Nameless. In Nameless, Deris stayed along with his school friend, drummer Ralf Maurer, who also played on both Deris' solo albums. In late 1984, Deris joined a band called Dragon with the two brothers Bruno and Oscar Di Blasio (""Di Blasio BrOs"") on guitar, and Bernd and Stefan Lüddemann (bass and drums).

"After playing live concerts in the Karlsruhe area, they went to Edo Zanki's studio in Karlsdorf and to Arco Studio, Munich, to record their first demo with producer Tony Monn. The following songs were recorded: ""I Was Made to Be With You"", ""Call Me Up"", ""Woman"", ""I Hear the Angels Singing"", ""Ballade of Glory"", and ""Rock Your Body Down"". During the production of the demo, drummer Bodo Schopf (ex-Michael Schenker Group) recorded some drum-parts. In 1986, when Bruno and Oscar Di Blasio, together with Deris (who had just finished military service), met Italian bass player Daniel De Niro, Kymera was born. Ralf Maurer alias ""Ralph Mason"" was again recruited as the new drummer of the band.

"Soon after, Kymera went to the Katapult-Tonstudio in Karlsruhe to record new songs for Francis, Day and Hunter GmbH Publishing. The following songs were recorded: ""Hello U.S.A."", ""Hot Looking Romeo"", ""Send Me a Letter"", and rearranged versions of ""I Was Made to Be with You"", ""Call Me Up"", and ""Woman"". After a few concerts, Maurer quit Kymera to go to university and was replaced by a young Kosta Zafiriou, and the line-up of Kymera was complete again. Soon, the band went to a studio in Mainz to record ""Shadows Are Falling"", ""Lonely Would Be Loving You"", and a new version of ""Ballade of Glory"", and played many live dates in Germany until the end of 1986. In the beginning of 1987, Deris and Kosta Zafiriou left Kymera to form the band Pink Cream 69.

"Deris was hired for the recording sessions for No Mercy, a band-project based in Appenweier/Offenburg in South Germany, founded by three locals: Bobby Benz (bass), Rüdiger Föll (drums), and Uwe Ulm (lead guitar). He also played two gigs with No Mercy. On the second and last gig, Pink Cream 69 played as a support band for No Mercy; on that evening Deris was the lead singer for both bands and hit the stage twice, opening with the very first lineup of Pink Cream 69.

"In 1993, Helloween was undergoing lineup changes. Gone was Ingo Schwichtenberg, replaced by ex-Gamma Ray drummer Uli Kusch, and Michael Kiske, replaced by Deris. The new lineup recorded Master of the Rings. Deris immediately became a songwriter for the band, resulting in tunes like ""Why?"", ""Perfect Gentleman"" and ""In the Middle of a Heartbeat"". The Time of the Oath in 1996 further lifted up the band's album sales, culminating in a world tour and a concert DVD along with double-CD live album, High Live, set from three concerts in Spain and Italy. While Helloween would go on a break, Deris would record his first solo album, Come In from the Rain. Deris sang and played guitar, accompanied by Peter Idera (guitar), Ralph Maison (drums and backing vocals), and Gisbert Royder (bass).

"Deris has a son born in 1990 or 1991. Since 1996, he has resided in Tenerife, Spain, but intends to move to the Seychelles one day. Commenting on the differences between Tenerife and Germany, Deris said:
",17,== Personal life ==
"""I remember when we first came there, like some 18 years ago, there was [sic] so many things not regulated. Much more freedom and now with Brussels doing stupid laws in each and every corner of our lives, I feel for me personally it's going too far and probably they are bored there. Otherwise, I can't explain all these stupid laws they are committing, and they are actually doing. Life is still great on Tenerife, but not as great as it used to be some 18 years ago. So if it goes on like that in the next 10 years with regulations and even more Europeanizing the shit out of it, then I'm off to the Seychelles.""
