"Holmes began playing also saxophone at age 16 and emulated the style of his childhood friend, Johnny Hodges. He began playing professionally a week later. After moving to New York City he worked for a variety of groups, including Luis Russell in 1928. Between 1929 and 1930, he recorded with Red Allen, and is best known for composing ""Sugar Hill Function"". He would work with Russell again a few times and in 1932 joined the Mills Blue Rhythm Band.
