"Dame Maroie or Maroie de Dregnau de Lille (fl. 13th century) was a trouvère from Arras, in Artois, France. She debates Dame Margot in a jeu parti, or debate song, ""Je vous pri, dame Maroie."" This song survives in two manuscripts, which each give separate and unrelated melodies. In two manuscripts she is credited with a fragment of a song, ""Mout m'abelist quant je voi revenir."" Dame Maroie is the addressee in a grand chant by Andrieu Contredit d'Arras. She was identified as the Maroie de Dregnau de Lille from whom a single strophe of a single chanson remains, ""Mout m'abelist quant je voi revenir"" (in a typical trouvère form, ABABCDE), along with its music.
