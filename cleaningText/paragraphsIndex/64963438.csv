",1,== Early life ==
"Reza Shirmarz was born in Khoy and raised in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. His mother, a kind-hearted housewife as well as an art lover, although not highly educated and his father a ground forces general who had no interest in art despite of his hidden artistic talent, taught him synchronously love and discipline. Reza is a born bilingual. He has been speaking Persian and Turkish since his birthday. He is left-handed.
",2,== Early life ==
"Reza has been influenced profoundly by great modern and classic writers and thinkers since his childhood. In a way, he was raised in an intellectual milieu, since his siblings were all well-educated. He was at the beginning influenced by his brother who was a movie fan and now is a script-writer and film director as well as by his sister who was into social sciences especially sociology. He began to read Persian classic literature, especially Rumi, when he was a teen. He also was quite fascinated by modern short stories, particularly the works of great modern Iranian writer, Sadegh Hedayat. He began to read intensively the non-Persian literature after a couple of years. This was the first step for him to get familiar with western literature. Later on, Reza began to read more of ancient and modern drama which strengthened his creative imagination. Such an intensive reading assisted him in his playwriting and translation career in the coming years. He said once: ""Reading and translation were like workshops I attended in order to learn how to create drama."" Poetry is another branch of literature that the Iranian author and artist has pursued throughout his life. In addition to Iranian classic and modern poets, Reza attempted to go meticulously through the eastern and western poetry as well. In the coming years he wrote a book on modern English poets T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats.

He received a scholarship from the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the effort and assistance of Konstantinos Passalis, the cultural deputy of Greek embassy in Iran in 2009.
