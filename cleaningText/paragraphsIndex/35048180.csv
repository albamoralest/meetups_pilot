"In 2009 he recorded Never Pet a Burning Dog with the band douBt with guitarist Michel Delville and pianist Alex Maguire. The album received four stars from Down Beat magazine. In the annual poll by Arnaldo DeSouteiro, Bianco was one of the top five drummers and douBt was the third best instrumental group. In 2011, Bianco and Delville created the electro-jazz project Machine Mass, which was joined by Dave Liebman in 2012. Bianco is known for his ""mercurial"", ""octopusian"" drumming style, which combines the sounds of free jazz and straight jazz and reflects Bianco's ""musical creed â€“ to be ""loose and tense, free and strict"".
