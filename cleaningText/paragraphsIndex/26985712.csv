"In May 2013, Vice Ganda was widely criticized for making several jokes about gang rape during his I-Vice Ganda Mo Ko! comedy concert show. One of them was directed towards respected news anchor Jessica Soho, whom he mentioned in a joke regarding several personalities starring in a hypothetical pornographic film. Philippine women's rights group GABRIELA condemned the joke as being distasteful in light of rape victims. GMA reporter Arnold Clavio, a colleague of Soho, defended the news anchor and expressed his disapproval of Vice Ganda's body-shaming remark in one of the former's radio programs. Although Vice Ganda initially defended his stance, saying that the brand of humor he uses is based on his roots doing stand-up in comedy bars and karaoke lounges, the comedian issued an apology over the issue during an episode of It's Showtime.

"Actress Nora Aunor also took umbrage at Vice Ganda's style of humor when she pulled out of her appearance as a special guest judge for the Tawag ng Tanghalan grand finals at the last minute. Aunor believed Vice Ganda's brand of insult comedy was against her moral beliefs, and was perturbed with the idea of being on the show alongside Vice Ganda.

"On one of his daily comedic discussions following a performance by Gian Magdangal on Tawag ng Tanghalan: Celebrity Champions, Vice Ganda made a joke after the founder of Kingdom of Jesus Christ, Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, among other claims of being responsible for stopping calamities, claimed that he was responsible for stopping the earthquakes in Mindanao. Vice Ganda jokingly challenged Pastor Quiboloy to stop one of the longest running and undying ABS-CBN television series, Ang Probinsyano and the common Philippine problem which is the constant traffic on EDSA. Members of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ took offense and expressed their dismay for Vice Ganda. Radio broadcaster and SMNI anchor, Mike Abe, a friend of Quiboloy, defended the founder and launched his foul-mouthed tirade on Vice Ganda about the controversial ""stop"" joke on Quiboloy. Two days after the joke, Quiboloy instead threatened that he will not only stop FPJ's Ang Probinsyano and shut down ABS-CBN as a whole within 4 months. Before saying these threats by Quiboloy, however, the company's contract, originally expiring on March 30, 2020, ended on May 4, 2020 based on Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra's speech during the Senate hearing on alleged violations made by ABS-CBN. Two weeks after the shutdown of ABS-CBN, Quiboloy delivered the message to Vice Ganda on his show, Powerline, that he prophesized the network and Ang Probinsyano's end. However, the show (Ang Probinsyano) and all ABS-CBN shows and programs are still ongoing on other TV stations and social media platforms.
