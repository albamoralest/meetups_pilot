"The first single ""I Don't Wanna Know"" was based on a sample of the Fugees' 1996 hit single ""Ready or Not"", which itself was based on a slowed-down sample of the instrumental track ""Boadicea"" by Enya from her 1987 self-titled album. Enya and her representatives said yes to Winans and P. Diddy for her approval of the sample. She even re-recorded Boadicea for the song, although Winans had no idea that the Fugees sample he had used was a sample itself. They even gave enya herself credit for the single as ""Mario Winans featuring P. Diddy and Enya"". The song features a rap by P. Diddy. The song was released as the single in early 2004 and became a worldwide hit, reaching number 1 in Germany and the United Kingdom and on the rhythmic top 40 radio chart in the United States; to number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the US R&B/Hip-Hop singles chart; and to number 3 on both the Australian and Norwegian singles charts. It also reached the top ten on a composite European singles chart.
