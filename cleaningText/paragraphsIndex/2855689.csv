"Ralf Scheepers (born 5 February 1965) is the vocalist for German heavy metal band Primal Fear. He has a relatively high-pitched tenor-esque singing voice and sometimes uses a shriek reminiscent of Judas Priest's Rob Halford, although it is his baritone lows which give him a near four-octave range in the modal register. He has also sung in Gamma Ray and Tyran' Pace. Scheepers has also done guest vocals for the bands Scanner, Therion, Ayreon, and Shadow Gallery, and worked with Tom Galley on Phenomena's Blind Faith album. He currently provides instruction for all around singing, music, studio and recording/processing techniques at RS Vocal Works in Baltmannsweiler, Germany. Writer Paul Stenning has described Scheepers as ""the greatest example of strength in metal.""
