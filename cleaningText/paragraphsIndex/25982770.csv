From there, Louis went on to form his own record label ""Ever After Records"", on which he released the EP's ""Me & Her"" (2009), ""Super Soaker"" (2010) and ""Number One"" (2011), a collaboration with German producer Patrick Alavi. He followed this with the single ""My Turn"", which featured guest vocals by Yann Destal of Modjo.
