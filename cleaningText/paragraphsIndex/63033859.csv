"de Witte was born in Ghent, Belgium on 21 July 1992. Around 2009, she started to explore Ghent's underground nightclub scene, where she was drawn to electronic music. She started DJing in 2010, mainly playing electro music; her production work commenced about two years later. Winning a Studio Brussel DJ contest in 2011, she subsequently performed at the Tomorrowland festival. She adopted the alias Raving George to avoid negative preconceptions against female DJs, releasing her debut EP in 2013. Following the release of a string of EPs on Bad Life and Crux Records, her 2015 single ""You're Mine,"" which featured Oscar and the Wolf, became a hit. In 2015, de Witte dropped her alias and started using her real name.  Her debut EP under her name, Weltschmerz, was released on the same year on Turbo Recordings. These were followed by a string of 2017 EPs, as well as 2018's Heart of Mine and The Healer EPs. de Witte has performed at various notable electronic music events, including Junction 2 Festival, Boiler Room and Printworks. In 2019, she launched her own label, KNTXT. Artists such as Chris Liebing, Monoloc, Alignment have been welcomed to KNTXT. On December 31, 2020, she performed at Tomorrowland, which was held online virtually due to COVID-19. On February 5, 2021, she announced her engagement to Italian techno DJ and producer Enrico Sangiuliano via social media. On February 25, 2021, she performed online on open space at the ancient stadium of Messene, after being invited by the  Onassis Foundation. On April 29, 2021, she streamed in collaboration with Formula 1, from the Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello racetrack, ahead of her Formula EP.
