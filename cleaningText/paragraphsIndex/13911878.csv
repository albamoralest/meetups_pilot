"Doria has consistently received positive reviews. The Stranger praised him as ""all solid...  omni present... (and the) backbone holding it all down,"" and stated that he ""never lets his immense chops get in the way of momentum or soul."" All About Jazz says his ""deft... tasteful roadhouse temperament never allows the pieces to veer off course.""Performances in Fall of 2007 include The Joe Doria Trio with Chris Spencer on guitar and Byron Vannoy on drums and McTuff with Skerik on saxophone, Andy Coe on guitar and Dvonne Lewis on drums. Tarik Abouzied eventually joined McTuff, replacing Dvonne Lewis on drums.
