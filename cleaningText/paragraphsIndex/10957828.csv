"The Advisory Circle's first release was Mind How You Go, issued as a 3"" CD in 2005. An extensive feature in The Wire magazine explored Brooks' fascination with public information films from the 1970s. They describe their sound as ""Everything's fine, but there is something not quite right about it.""Cate Brooks also releases music, under her own name and a variety of alter-egos, with similar musical influences (such as soundtrack music and library music), emotional atmospheres, and conceptual themes to The Advisory Circle material, through the Clay Pipe Music label and her own label Caf√© Kaput.
