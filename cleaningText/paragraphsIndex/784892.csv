On August 2, 2007, it was reported that Bier filed a lawsuit against Manson for unpaid ""partnership proceeds"". Bier claims Manson spent the band's earnings on ""sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy (including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl)"" and on various other luxurious items. Bier claimed that Manson ""devised a campaign to drive Bier out of the band and rob him of his entitlement"". On December 19, 2007, Manson filed a counter suit against Bier, accusing him of breach of contract.  According to metalunderground.com, the lawsuit was settled for a sum far less than what was originally sought by Bier with the total being $380,000.  $175,000 was paid out by Marilyn Manson while the rest was ordered to be paid by Stephen Bier's former business managers.
