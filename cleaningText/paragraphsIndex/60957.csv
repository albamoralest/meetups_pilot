"Ginn was born June 8, 1954 in Tucson, Arizona.  He began an electronics company in Hermosa Beach, California, called Solid State Tuners, when he was 12 years old and an amateur radio operator.  Ginn became a vegetarian at 17 years old in 1971 and has been a vegan since 1998.  Ginn is the older brother of artist Raymond Ginn, who goes by the pseudonym of Raymond Pettibon.

"On October 10, 2014, Ginn's ex-wife Marina filed a motion in court to prevent Ginn from having access to their children, claiming Ginn was ""routinely denying them food and threatening them,"" ""abusing alcohol and drugs in front of them,"" had ""forced [the children] to do cleaning chores until 2 a.m."" ""locked [them] in a room alone with no contact with the outside world through cell phone or emails,"" and had ""throw[n] cups of water in their face."" She also claimed he had told his daughters ""you're hot"" and ""whistled at them,"" and told them ""they are getting fat and need to lose weight and that their diets will have to be more strenuous."" Ex-Black Flag member Ron Reyes later submitted an affidavit to the court supporting Marina Ginn's statements.

"Black Flag is an American hardcore punk band formed in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California.  The band was established by Greg Ginn, the guitarist, primary songwriter, and sole continuous member through multiple personnel changes in the band.  They are widely considered to be one of the first hardcore punk bands.  After breaking up in 1986, Black Flag briefly reunited in 2003 and again in 2013.  Black Flag's sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with atonal guitar solos and frequent tempo shifts.  The lyrics were written mostly by Ginn, and like other punk rock bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Black Flag voiced an anti-authoritarian and non-conformist message, in songs punctuated with descriptions of social isolation, neurosis, poverty, and paranoia.  These themes were explored further when Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer in 1981.  Most of the band's material was released on Ginn's SST Records.

"""Dale Nixon"" is a pseudonym and multiple-use name originally used by Ginn to obfuscate the fact that he played bass on the later Black Flag albums, My War and What The...  It has since been used by other artists (typically punk) to appear on albums without being in breach of record label contracts that stipulate label exclusivity.  Other artists using the ""Dale Nixon"" moniker include Dave Grohl, who filled in on drums for the Melvins' 1992 album King Buzzo, and Brian Baker, a founding member of Minor Threat, credited as Nixon on the 1992 Dag Nasty album Four on the Floor.  The name appears once again, listed as a bass player, on the Ryan Adams album Orion; it is likely Ryan himself.
