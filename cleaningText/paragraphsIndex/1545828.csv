"From 1964, Andrews supported his nascent career as a singer-songwriter by working as a schoolteacher, before becoming a full-time professional musician in 1966. He collaborated on a successful musical depicting life growing up in Birmingham in the 1940s and 1950s. Go Play Up Your Own End has been well received across the Midlands, especially in its production in 2006 featuring Jasper Carrot in a major role, but has yet to make the transfer to London. The musical has played at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, the Birmingham Hippodrome and the Alexandra Theatre, thus setting a record of having been staged at every one of the second city's major theatres.
