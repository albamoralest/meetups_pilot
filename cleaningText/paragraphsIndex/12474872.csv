"Isidro grew up in Marikina along with her parents and siblings. She is the youngest among the girls and considered herself as ""daddy's girl"". Growing up, she never saw herself as beautiful because of her ethnic features as a child. Isidro was skinny, dark-skinned, black hair, and has knobby knees compared to her siblings who were light-skinned and brown-haired. Because of her looks, she was teased a lot by her siblings and relatives, which left her emotionally scarred. After graduating college in UP Diliman, she left home and pursued a degree in Fashion Buying and Merchandising in the prestigious Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. New Yorkers were fascinated by her ethnic features, which gave Isidro a boost of confidence and self-esteem. Living alone, she felt homesick and struggled to make ends meet with her allowance given by her parents. However, Isidro was determined to prove that she could live alone in the Big Apple. She focused on school and graduated magna cum laude. When she entered show business at age 25, she was like a breath of fresh air to the Filipino audience. Her beauty and talent stood out and was given the title as ""crush ng bayan"" or ""people's crush"" because of her girl-next-door persona. Isidro continued to rise as a talent and was given numerous projects including recording albums, movies, television, and theater. Up to this date, she is considered to be one of the most beautiful women and best dressed celebrities in the Philippines.
