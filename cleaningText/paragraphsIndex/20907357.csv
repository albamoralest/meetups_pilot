"Caligula is a practitioner of LaVeyan Satanism, and while he has on one hand distanced himself from National Socialist black metal, as well as the Nazi ideology and the ""attitude at that time,"" he has also said that aspects of Nazi ideology were ""not that wrong"" and that the Nazi concentration camps were bad, but not ""that horribly bad."" Like many other black metal musicians, he has generally assumed an apolitical stance, although he expressed disdain for former Islamic terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, with his audience when playing live. He has also denounced Roman Catholic priests due to widespread child molestation allegations.

"Caligula was quoted as being ""somewhat impressed"" by the premeditated murder of Fr. Faustino Gazziero, a Catholic priest, by Dark Funeral fan Rodrigo Orias at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Santiago, Chile, further stating that ""He deserves some credit. You're not supposed to say that, but I don't care."" Although he suggested the possibility that ""the music triggered him somehow,"" he denied Dark Funeral's music being the direct cause of Orias' murder of Gazziero.

"Caligula also recalled having met Orias at a Dark Funeral concert in 2003, where he burnt a cross on Orias' arm at his request with a Cuban cigar.
