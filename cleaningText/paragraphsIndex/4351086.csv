"According to most sources, Michael David Rock was born in 1948 in Hammersmith, London, the son of David and Joan Rock, although in a 2017 interview he stated that his birth name was Michael Edward Chester Smith, and his birth was the result of his mother's relationship with an American airman. He was educated at Emanuel School in London, and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating with a degree in Medieval and Modern Languages. While at Cambridge, he developed an interest in 19th century Romantic poetry—principally the works of Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Shelley, and Byron—and his first appearance in the press came after he was arrested for marijuana possession.

This was Barrett's first promotional activity in decades, after he retired from music in the early 1970s.
