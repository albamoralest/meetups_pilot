"Derek Watkins was born on 2 March 1945, in Reading, Berkshire England. His great-grandfather had been a brass player in Wales with the Salvation Army. His grandfather taught brass at Reading University and was a founding member of the Reading Spring Gardens Brass Band, which he conducted until he was succeeded by Watkins' father. Watkins learned to play the cornet when he was four years old. He played in the brass band and with his father's dance band at Reading's Majestic Ballroom until he became a professional musician at age 17. Beginning his professional career in London, Watkins was a member of Jack Dorsey's band at the Astoria Ballroom for two years (1963–65), and then joined Billy Ternent's orchestra at the London Palladium. He then became a freelance musician. Watkins played in dance bands and big bands led by Ted Heath and John Dankworth, and in 1969 he toured and recorded with Benny Goodman. From 1970 to 1974 he worked as a studio musician in Los Angeles and recorded with The Beatles, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Frank Sinatra, and Barbra Streisand. He often performed at Dante's jazz club with Louie Bellson and Don Menza, and he played with Count Basie, Oscar Peterson and Dizzy Gillespie, who nicknamed Watkins ""Mr. Lead"". He was a longtime member of the James Last Orchestra.
