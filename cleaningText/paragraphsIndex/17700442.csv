"Christian was born in Chicago, Illinois. His ""father was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, into a share-cropper's family. Realizing the futility of that life, Christian's grandfather sold his livestock and sent his family to Chicago, where Christian was born in 1932 on 44th Street and Prairie Avenue."" Christian's mother, a church pianist, helped him with music. When she became director of the church choir, he took over on the piano; sometimes they played organ–piano duets in the church. His father ""also sang and played the blues on piano in speakeasies and rent parties, but ultimately stopped performing and followed his wife into the church"". Christian attended Wendell Phillips High in Chicago.
