"In 2019, Miller began releasing singles from his debut studio album with ""The Come Down"" and ""Show Your Skin"" with ""Bitterness"" released in April 2020. In February 2021, Miller released his debut studio album Little Love. Miller worked with producer Alex Henriksson and sound engineer Matt Neighbour. On making the album, Miller said ""There is truth in every lyric, meaning behind every melody, feeling in every hum. Little Love is an album that wraps itself around my life for the last 3 years. There is an honesty in the album that I never truly sang or wrote about until this album. Giving myself up in a way that has always terrified me. There were truths I had to confront and lessons that needed to be learnt. I had to own who I was but most importantly own who I wasn't and truthfully, at times that hurt.""
