"Sumner began writing songs at the age of 15, and signed a multi-record deal with Island Records at age 17. They spent six months writing and recording a debut album, The Constant (2010), in Sweden with producer Klas Åhlund, keyboardist Emlyn Maillard, and multi-instrumentalist and producer Al Shux under the band name I Blame Coco. The album included elements of pop music, electronic music, ska, and punk. The first single, ""Caesar"", featured Swedish pop singer Robyn. The next single, ""Self Machine"", was released in July 2010. According to Christian Wåhlberg, Sumner's manager, Åhlund, had been keen to work with Sumner because they saw the ""punk rocker"" in them. Wåhlberg said that the electropop sound of the album was influenced by Darcus Beese, president of Island Records, and that if Sumner had signed to a different record label, the music would have been different.

"Eliot Paulina Sumner is the child of musician Sting (Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner) and actress Trudie Styler. Sumner was born in Pisa, Italy, grew up in Wiltshire, England, and was educated at Bryanston School and then the Fine Arts College in London. They grew up at Lake House, the family estate near Stonehenge. Eliot has two brothers (Jake and Giacomo), a sister (Mickey), an older half-brother (Joe), and a half-sister (Kate). The family gave Sumner the nickname ""Coco"". Drawn to the outdoors, Sumner spent a lot of time alone in the woods. Their family gave them their first guitar at age four or five, they wrote their first song at age 13, and signed a record deal four years later. After recording and touring with I Blame Coco, they lived alone in a cottage in the Lake District of England and became interested in house music. Sumner also works as a DJ in European dance clubs under the moniker ""Vaal"". Sumner's sense of smell was lost after a brain injury in 2009. In December 2015, Sumner said that they did not believe in gender labels and did not identify with a particular gender. They use gender-neutral pronouns.
