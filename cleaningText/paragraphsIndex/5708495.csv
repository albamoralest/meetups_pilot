"After moving to the Serbian city Kruševac in the 1980s, Rešić converted from Islam to Serbian Orthodoxy and changed his Muslim name Amir to the Christian Nikola, as his then-wife followed the Serbian Orthodox faith. He converted back to Islam in 2004 and changed his name back to Amir. Rešić was married and divorced three times, with the marriages resulting in daughters Amela, Sandra and Tamara. Sandra Rešić competed in the 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons of the televised singing competition Zvezde Granda.

"Rešić complained of severe stomach pain on the morning of 18 October 2007 and was taken to a Bijeljina hospital by friend Siniša Kajmaković, manager of the Bijeljina-based record label Renome. Rešić soon left the hospital, against doctors recommendations, fearing the reaction of the media to his illness. Throughout the day, Rešić complained of intense pain, and at 10 PM an ambulance was called. Rešić lost consciousness during the ride to the hospital and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. He died that night aged 43 of pancreas perforation caused by prolonged alcoholism.
