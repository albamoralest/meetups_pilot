"Jimmy Ryan formed Upheaval with Brian Allen (Bass), Jeremy King (Drums), Nathan Stambro (Guitars) and Ben Parrish (Guitars) (also in Demiricous) in 1997. The band recorded their debut EP, Downfall of the Ascendancy of Man in 1997. In 1999, Ryan left the band along with Allen, and were replaced by Drew and Bryan Grimes. In 2002, Ryan joined Christian metal outfit, Haste the Day. He recorded on their first Three release and decided to leave in 2005, being replaced by ex-New Day Awakening vocalist Stephen Keech. A year after leaving Haste the Day, Ryan formed Trenches with Phil Hook, Eli Larch Chastain, Bill Scott, and Joel David Lauver. In 2008, the band released their debut album The Tide Will Swallow Us Whole through Solid State Records. The band stated on their Facebook page they were working on a New EP that was to be titled, Reckoner, but Lauver's personal page stated that Trenches had disbanded. In 2012, the band stated they had reunited and were working on the Reckoner album. In 2014, he later rejoined Haste the Day, being featured on the band's 2015 release, Coward.
