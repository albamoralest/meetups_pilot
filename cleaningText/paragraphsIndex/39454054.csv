"In September 2014, she had her debut as a solo singer with the release of her first single. In February 2015, Nitta's talent agency announced she would be suspending activities for two months to receive treatment for her vocal cord polyps. She returned to work mid-April after non-invasive treatment. In 2016, Weekly Asahi Geinou ran an article accusing Nitta of appearing in an adult video prior to her voice acting debut, due to similarities in looks and the placement of certain moles between Nitta and the AV actress in question. In response, S-inc published a statement denying Nitta's involvement. Nitta's weekly livestream Nico Nico broadcast Emint Night was also postponed.
