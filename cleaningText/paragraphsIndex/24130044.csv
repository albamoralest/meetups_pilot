"Jackie Robinson became the lead singer of The Pioneers in 1967. Robinson recorded extensively with The Pioneers for the next twenty years and still performs with the group. He also recorded solo material, including the ""Over & Over"" single in 1968, and ""Heart Made of Stone"" in 1970. In the 1970s, his partner in The Pioneers, Sydney Crooks, moved into production, and worked with Dennis Brown while he was in the United Kingdom. The results of this included the album Dennis Brown Meets Harry Hippy, which was split between Brown and Robinson, Robinson taking on this pseudonym after recording a cover version of the Bobby Womack hit of the same name. He went on to work with other UK-based producers, including Clement Bushay (""Don't Leave Me This Way"") and Lloyd Charmers (""Jamaican Child""). Robinson also recorded the track ""Don't Do the Crime"" with UB40 on their 2002 album UB40 Present the Fathers Of Reggae.
