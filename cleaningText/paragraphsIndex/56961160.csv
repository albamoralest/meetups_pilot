"Alexa's interest in music began at age three when she disappeared from a birthday party and was discovered in the basement playing melodies to simple songs on a toy piano. She soon expressed a preference for the violin, and began taking lessons. Although she began to sing during this period, she believed the violin to be her primary instrument and considered pursuing it vocationally. After elementary school, Alexa's family moved back to Croatia. She began singing songs in English as a way of maintaining her connection to her mother tongue and her childhood in the United States. In Zagreb, Alexa took voice lessons at the Rock Academy. Musician and club owner Boško Petrović mentored her – she began attending regional jazz workshops and performing professionally, including at Croatian festivals. Alexa studied psychology at Northeastern University before transferring to the New School in New York City; she completed her psychology degree and received a fine arts degree in jazz performance. She cites drummer Bernard Purdie as a mentor during this time.
