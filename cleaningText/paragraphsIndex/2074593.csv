"Rasmussen was born in Sandnes, Rogaland County, Norway. His first musical ventures were with the black metal band The Childmolesters, which he founded in 1990 alongside his future Carpathian Forest bandmate Johnny ""Nordavind"" Kr√∏vel.

During Carpathian Forest's first years of existence, Nattefrost used the pseudonym Lord Nosferatu; he would not be known as ""Nattefrost"" (Norwegian for ""Night frost"") until 1995, when the band released its first EP, Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods.
