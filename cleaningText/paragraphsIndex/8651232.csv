"In Immortal, he is known for his lyrics which, unconventionally for black metal, focus on icy landscapes and a fictional land called Blashyrkh. The story of Blashyrkh is gradually told throughout Immortal's albums. When writing lyrics he often takes long walks in the Norwegian countryside near his hometown of Bergen for inspiration. He was known for his simplistic but extremely fast guitar parts which always featured power chords. He and frontman Abbath comprised the core of Immortal in its early years, with other members fluctuating and little stability until drummer Horgh joined the band in 1997.

"Demonaz played guitar on the albums Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism, Pure Holocaust and Battles in the North, with his last musical contribution to Immortal being the 1997 album Blizzard Beasts. That same year, he was diagnosed with acute tendinopathy and could no longer play guitar at the speed required for Immortal. Instead, he continued to write lyrics for the band and often took the role of manager. He often accompanied the band on tour and was still seen by Abbath, Horgh and Apollyon as a member of the band. After having surgery to correct his tendinitis in 2013, he was able to play guitar again and has returned to that role in the band since Abbath's departure.
