"Marcelle Soulage was born in Lima, Peru, to French parents. Her father was a mining engineer and had been appointed Professor of Mineralogical Chemistry at the Instituto de Ingenieros de Minas del Perú. The family returned to Paris when Marcelle was four-and-a-half years old. She began piano lessons at the age of five, and subsequently entered the Conservatoire de Paris studying with Georges Caussade, Paul Vidal, Vincent d'Indy and Nadia Boulanger. Soulage served as professor of piano at the Conservatoire d'Orléans (1921–1925) and professor of music theory at the Conservatoire de Paris (1949–1965). Soulage composed orchestral works, chamber music and songs, sometimes writing under the pseudonym Marc Sauval. Her Suite for violin, viola and piano won the Prix Leaulle in 1918, and Cello Sonata the Prix des Amis de la Musique in 1920. Soulage's music is published by: Evette & Schaeffer; Buffet-Crampon; Max Eschig; Rouart, Lerolle & Cie; L. Philippo.
