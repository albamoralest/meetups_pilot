"In 1984 Belan formed the band Đavoli (The Devils), which performed music inspired by the 1950s rock and roll. The band successfully performed until 1991. In 1991 appeared Belan's first solo release, EP Rock galama (Rock Noise), recorded with the members of Đavoli. In 1991 Đavoli disbanded due to the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars, and 1991 Split Festival, where Belan and Anja Šovagović-Despot were scheduled to perform the song ""Ljubav postoji zbog nas"", was canceled. Belan appeared on the Split Festival in 1992 performing song ""Zaboravi"". In 1993 he released his first solo album, Vino noći (Night Wine). The album vas recorded with members of Daleka Obala. Vino noći featured hits ""Zaboravi"", ""Sunčan dan"" (written by Zdravko Bajan, a former member of Narodno Blago), ""A gdje si ti?"" and ""Ljubav postoji zbog nas"" (previously unreleased duet with Anja Šovagović-Despot). The album also featured English language versions of ""Vino noći"" and ""Sunčan dan"". In 1994 he released EP Mama (Mum), and the title track was a candidate for the Croatian representative at the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest. The EP also featured songs ""Beat na moru"" (a cover of the 1960s Delfini hit) and ""Ne pitaj za nju"" (a duet with Tony Cetinski).

"In 1998 Belan reunited Đavoli when Vedran Križan joined the band as the keyboardist, thus finished the gathering of the group, soon to be known as ""Fiumens"", but not before they tried to revive old ""Đavoli"" brand so the band released the album Space Twist. However, Đavoli disbanded once again, and Neno, Olja, Leo and Vedran formed the band Neno Belan & Fiumens, and they released albums Luna & Stelle in 2002 and Rijeka snova (The River of Dreams) in 2007 as Neno Belan & Fiumens, as well as ""Dream factory"" in 2009, double CD, live from ""Tvornica"" (factory), for which they got many discography awards in Croatia (Porin).
