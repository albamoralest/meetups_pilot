"He was born Floyd Westerman on the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation, home of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, a federally recognized tribe that is one of the sub-tribes of the Eastern Dakota section of the Great Sioux Nation, located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. His Indigenous name Kanghi Duta means ""Red Crow"" in the Dakota language (which is one of the three related Siouan languages of the Great Plains). At the age of 10, Westerman was sent to the Wahpeton Boarding School, where he first met Dennis Banks (who as an adult became a leader of the American Indian Movement).  There Westerman and the other children were forced to cut their traditionally long hair and forbidden to speak their native languages.  This experience would profoundly impact Westerman's development and entire life. As an adult, he reclaimed his heritage and became an outspoken advocate for Indigenous cultural preservation. Westerman graduated from Northern State University with a B.A. degree in secondary education. He served two years in the US Marines, before beginning his career as a country singer.

"Before entering films and television, Westerman had established a solid reputation as a country-western music singer. In his songwriting he explored and critiqued the European influences on Native American communities. In addition to several solo recordings, Westerman collaborated with Jackson Browne, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Harry Belafonte, Joni Mitchell, Kris Kristofferson, and Buffy Sainte-Marie.  In the 1990s, he toured with Sting to raise funds to preserve the endangered rain forests. After years performing as a singer, Westerman became interested in acting.  His film debut was in Renegades (1989), in which he played ""Red Crow"", the Lakota Sioux father of Hank Storm, played by Lou Diamond Phillips.  Additional film roles include ""Chief Ten Bears"" in Dances with Wolves (1990), and the ""shaman"" for the singer Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's The Doors (1991). Westerman appeared as Standing Elk, alongside his long-time friend Max Gail, in the family film, Tillamook Treasure (2006). He appeared in Hidalgo (2004), as Chief Eagle Horn in Buffalo Bill's circus. In September 2007, Westerman finished work for the film Swing Vote (2008). Television roles included playing ""George"" on Dharma & Greg, ""Uncle Ray"" on Walker, Texas Ranger (in the pilot and first regular seasons), ""One Who Waits"" on Northern Exposure, and multiple appearances as ""Albert Hosteen"" on The X-Files.  Westerman also did numerous Public Service Announcements for television including for the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.
