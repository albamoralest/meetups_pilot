"She practiced fencing in high school, and ranked 3rd in a tournament in Tokyo in 1991. She began her career as a model in commercials, notably for the confectionery company Lotte (ロッテ), then debuted in acting in 1992 in the drama Sono Toki, Heart wa Nusumareta. She became a swimsuit model for the swimwear company Unitika in 1993, and got popular as an idol, partly due to her then unusual tomboyish look with short hair and husky voice. She began to get large exposure in commercials and media, and hosted her own weekly 30mn late radio show, Yozora ni YOUKISS!, from April 1994 to March 2001 on Nippon Broadcasting.

She went on a successful singing career for the next two years, her first album ranking number 1, with hits written by Tetsuya Komuro (notably ""Only You"" and ""Baby's Growing Up""), a career which she stopped in 2000 to concentrate on acting.
