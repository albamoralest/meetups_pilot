"His marches were published throughout the world and the Americans acclaimed him as 'the Sousa of the Antipodes'.  Lithgow produced approximately two hundred marches, as well as numerous pieces for band, orchestra, piano and voice.  He acquired no copyrights and many of his pieces, in his immaculate notation, were lost or unpublished. Music dominated his existence, but time for composing was scarce when after a long day's work he cycled home to change for an evening performance or a musical gathering.
",23,== Later life ==
"He died on June 12, 1929 at the age of 59 a few months short of his 60th birthday Lithgow died of a Stroke at Launceston. At his funeral massed bands played The 'Invercargill'.  He is buried in Carr Villa cemetery. He was survived by his wife, son and two daughters. One of the granddaughters Pat Ward wrote a book on him. In 1953 a memorial plaque was unveiled at Paterson Street Barracks and a Band Rotunda built in City Park, Launceston. Still today in Tasmania they continue with Lithgow-only concerts. Tasmanians regard him as theirs but to Kiwis he is from Invercargill.

",25,== Later life ==
