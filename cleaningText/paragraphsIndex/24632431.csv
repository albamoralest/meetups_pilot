"Stevens was born in Alum Creek, West Virginia. At age nine, he and his brother Warren entered a talent contest and won first place. Eventually, they and cousin Terry Dotson formed a band called Jeff Stevens and the Bullets, with Jeff on lead vocals and guitar, Warren on bass guitar, Dotson on drums, and Jim Mayo on rhythm guitar and harmonica. The band recorded Bolt out of the Blue for Atlantic America Records in 1986, which accounted for the singles ""Darlington County"" (a cover of the Bruce Springsteen song), ""You're in Love Alone"" and ""Geronimo's Cadillac."" A fourth chart single, ""Johnny Lucky and Suzi 66,"" led off a second self-titled album. In the mid-1980s, Jeff Stevens and Dotson co-wrote Atlanta's singles ""Atlanta Burned Again Last Night"" and ""Sweet Country Music.""The Bullets broke up in 1990 and Stevens remained on Atlantic as a solo artist, working with record producer Keith Stegall for a solo debut album which was never released. From there, Stevens found work as a songwriter, writing a string of hits including the singles ""I Fell in the Water"" by John Anderson, ""Down in Flames"" by Blackhawk, the number one hit ""Reckless"" for Alabama, and ""Big Love"" and ""I Wanna Feel That Way Again"" for Tracy Byrd. George Strait also recorded Stevens' ""Carried Away,"" ""Carrying Your Love with Me"" and ""True,"" the first two of which went to number one as well. Stevens had another number one in 2004 with Tim McGraw's ""Back When.""In 1999, Stevens began work as a record producer, co-producing Jerry Kilgore's debut album Love Trip. Among other acts Stevens produces  Luke Bryan, and co-wrote Bryan's singles ""All My Friends Say"", ""Someone Else Calling You Baby"" (which went to number one in early 2011), and ""Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"", also a number one hit for Bryan in late 2012.
