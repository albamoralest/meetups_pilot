"Bryden was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England, on 11 May 1920 and was the only child of Amos and Elsie Bryden.  Bryden's enthusiasm for jazz music started during her teenage years. She became a member of the National Rhythm Club when she was 17 and became secretary of the local branch in 1941. An ardent jazz fan she established a Nat Gonella fan club in her teens, before taking up the washboard and singing. Her vocal style was influenced by Bessie Smith but she avoided affectation of an American accent. She was a friend of Black Anna Hannant who ran the Jolly Butchers pub in Ber Street, Norwich. In 1942, aged 22, she moved to Cambridge. In 1945, after the war had ended, she moved to back to London, hoping to start a music career. She also worked with Mick Mulligan and George Melly at London jazz venues such as the Cook's Ferry Inn, Walthamstow and became a supporter of visiting American jazz acts when the Musicians Union ban was lifted and befriended, amongst others, Buck Clayton, Louis Armstrong and Bud Freeman, with whom she recorded.
