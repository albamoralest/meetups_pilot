"Baby Gramps plays a mixture of styles and eras including traditional blues, children's and labor songs, and his own compositions.  His busy and unusual guitar style includes flat and finger picking, and ""chording"" with the back of his hand and his elbow.  His singing styles include throat singing.  His performance is based in part on improvisation and he often encourages audience participation.  Baby Gramps has performed as a street musician, and has toured with Artis the Spoonman, Béla Fleck and the Flecktones and Phish. His rendition of ""The Teddy Bears' Picnic"" was featured in Martin Bell's Academy Award-nominated documentary film, Streetwise.

"Writer Patrick Ferris said he has ""a mass appeal in the sense that any audience between the age of 2 and 102 are captivated by his vaudeville antics, hilarious lyrics and animated guitar playing... His voice is a cross between Popeye the Sailor and a Didgeridoo and the plinkity plink of his VERY worn National steel guitar, sounds like a wind up jack in the box. If you listen closely and know anything about music, you'll realize Gramps is an absolutely incredible guitar player. Being a professional musician for over 40 years can't help but give you some sort of chops, but Gramps is a modern day Robert Johnson; a revolutionary guitarist that, like Thelonious Monk on piano, can play the notes 'between the cracks.'""

"This video was stitched together from three performances that were filmed at ""Funhouse"": A Contemporary Theatre, in conjunction with TheatreVision and ShadowCatcher Entertainment. Conceived and directed by Paul Magid and Ron W. Bailey. Stage show written by Magid; teleplay written by Magid and Alex Metcalf; musical direction by Mark Ettinger. ""Funhouse"" starred vaudevillians Dmitri Karamazov of the Flying Karamazov Brothers, Rebecca Chace, Cathy Sutherland and the UMO Ensemble, and featured Baby Gramps and Christian Swenson, among others. A psychedelically inspired feast was served by Chez Ray Sewal.
