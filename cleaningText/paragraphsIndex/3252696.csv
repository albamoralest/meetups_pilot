"Thomas was born in Breslau, Silesia. In the 1950s, he played as a musician for the RIAS broadcaster, typically live. The restored Brandenburg Gate in Berlin was re-opened in 2002 with a live version of the main theme of the Raumpatrouille soundtrack. In his directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002), actor George Clooney used three tracks of Peter Thomas' music originally composed for Edgar Wallace movies of the 1960s (in their original mono versions). The 1990s avant-garde band Mr. Bungle performed his piece ""Love In Space"" on several dates of their 1995/1996 tour for Disco Volante. UK Plunderphonics and avant-garde band, The Perrinormal, name Peter Thomas as one of their main influences, alongside John Barry and Lalo Schifrin.

"For some of his exceptional scores, Thomas used a self-developed musical instrument called ""ThoWiephon"", today being exhibited in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, standing near the famous Theremin, also being used in many movies.  According to UCM. ONE, a Movie company currently releasing a movie with the Soundtrack composed by Peter Thomas, he died on 17 May 2020 in Lugano.
