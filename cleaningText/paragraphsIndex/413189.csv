"An agent, Richie Lisella, heard her sing and took her career in hand, and soon she was signed to a contract with London Records. In 1949 she recorded the song Copenhagen (a jazz perennial) with the Dixieland All-Stars. For the B side she recorded the song ""Music! Music! Music!"". Unexpectedly, it was not the A side but the B side which took off, selling over a million copies and becoming Teresa's signature song. Another novelty song, ""Choo'n Gum"", hit the top 20 in 1950, followed by ""Molasses, Molasses"". Although she preferred to sing ballads, her only recorded ballad to make the charts was ""Longing for You"" in 1951.

"In 1951 Brewer switched labels, going to Coral Records. Since she never learned to read music, she had demos sent to her to learn the melodies of the songs she would record. She had a number of hits for Coral. In 1952, she recorded ""You'll Never Get Away"" in a duet with Don Cornell, followed in 1953 by her best selling hit, ""Till I Waltz Again with You"". In the mid-1950s she did a number of covers of rhythm and blues songs like ""Pledging My Love"" and ""Tweedle Dee"". She covered some country songs including ""Jilted"", ""I Gotta Go Get My Baby"", and ""Let Me Go, Lover!"". In 1956 she co-wrote ""I Love Mickey"", about New York Yankees center fielder Mickey Mantle, who appeared on the record with Brewer. It was also reported that the two had developed a mutual attraction. Another 1956 hit was Brewer's syncopated rendition of ""Mutual Admiration Society"". In the same year her hit ""A Sweet Old Fashioned Girl"" demonstrated in one song her ballad and rock talents. In 1957 she recorded more covers: of country song ""Teardrops in My Heart"" and R&B songs ""You Send Me"" and ""Empty Arms"".
