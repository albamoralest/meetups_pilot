"Priester was born in Outjo, South West Africa (now Namibia) to Brazilian parents. His first exposure to the instrument was at age four while watching a jazz ensemble perform on television. Priester moved to Brazil in 1977, and played football in teams like Foz do Iguaçu in Paraná, ABC, and Guairacá Flamenguinho until 1985. In 1985 he attended the Rock in Rio festival where he decided to become a drummer. Although he began playing on cans, he would eventually assemble a set consisting of a snare, tom (which he borrowed from his school), bass drum, hihat, and a cymbal, which he hung from his roof. His biggest influences are Nicko McBrain of Iron Maiden and Deen Castronovo of Journey. A local television band called The Tropical Band observed his performances and invited him to play a couple of songs; later the band Stylo Livre (freestyle) recruited him. Priester would struggle for years to come, but eventually find success with metal outfits throughout Brazil, and eventually receive the chance to audition for Angra, in 2000.

"He continued to play with Angra until their hiatus at the end of 2007 but eventually left the band to focus on his other band, Hangar. In 2010, he auditioned, along with six other drummers, for the chance to replace Dream Theater's former drummer, Mike Portnoy. The band ultimately decided to hire Mike Mangini as their new drummer. In 2013, it was announced that Priester had joined the prog metal band Midas Fate. On September 9, 2014, Priester was announced as Primal Fear's new drummer on the band's official Facebook page but left the band only months after.
