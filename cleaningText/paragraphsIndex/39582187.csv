"Hailing from Lake Forest, California, Tapia's parents migrated to the United States before his birth. Tapia was born in San Diego. His family then decided to relocate to Mexico. Tapia spent much of his youth in Culiacán, Sinaloa, where, at age 9, he entered the Difocur School of music in Culiacan, now known as the Instituto Sinaloense de Cultura (ISIC). Tapia specialized in clarinet, but also learned guitar and percussion instruments. During this time, Tapia gained public playing experience by performing with acts such as the Symphony of Sinaloa.
",2,== Early life ==
"At 13, the Tapia family again migrated to the US. Initially reluctant, Tapia was convinced by family and friends to perform at local venues such as dance halls and receptions. Before signing with a professional label, Tapia went door to door at record shops attempting to sell his recordings. At 17, Tapia's professional debut performance came in Tijuana, Baja California alongside fellow Sinaloan artist, El Lobito de Sinaloa. Tapia signed with Sony International and began his first album, blending his regional Norteña music with hints of electronica and hip hop.
