"On March 10, 2014, Showtek and Ookay released a single titled ""Bouncer"" via Showtek's label Skink Records. An official music video was uploaded by Spinnin' Records' YouTube channel two weeks later. On November 7, 2014, Ookay released his debut EP Ghost via Steve Aoki's label Dim Mak Records. When asked about his inspirations of creating the EP, Ookay said ""I really wanted to push the boundaries of my skill. It's kind of a punch in the shoulder to my fans who get mad when I make anything other than trap. So I made an entire EP that's pretty much not trap (except Egg Drop Soup). Really trying to convince everyone that i'm not a one-trick-pony"".
