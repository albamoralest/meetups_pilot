"Of Earth is a four-piece psychedelic/progressive band from NYC fronted by Rob De Luca on vocals and bass. Their self-titled debut album was mastered by Howie Weinberg and released on February 14, 2010. The album was reviewed by New York Music Daily and referred to as an ""Art-Rock Masterpiece"". In a 2012 interview with Music Legends, De Luca confirmed that he is working on the follow-up album. On February 21, 2013, Of Earth released the lead off single ""Prototype"" from their sophomore album The Monarch. In March 2013 Classic Rock magazine nominated ""Prototype"" for Track of the Week in a poll that also included David Bowie's song ""The Stars (Are Out Tonight)"" from his album The Next Day. Of Earth won the competition collecting more than two times as many votes as Bowie, who ranked No. 2. In June 2013 Classic Rock magazine again nominated Of Earth for Track of the Week, this time for the song ""Heart of the Hard Drive"". Of Earth won for the second straight time, gaining almost one third of all votes and beating Nine Inch Nails, Shinedown, Megadeth and Queensrÿche. In February 2015, Of Earth's song ""Sweep the Fire"" was chosen as Classic Rock magazine's Track of the Week. The song, from the album The Monarch, marks their third consecutive single being picked as Classic Rock magazine Track of the Week.
