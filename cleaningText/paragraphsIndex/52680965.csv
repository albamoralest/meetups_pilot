The album was recorded over a span of several years while on tour with Alt-J, and reflects Green's medical problems with anxiety and major hearing loss due to Alport syndrome.

"Green plays without any type of cymbals, instead replacing the usual hi-hat with a muted cowbell, and the cymbals for a tambourine. He has however added a small Chopper cymbal for the song ""Pleader"" used on tours after the release of Relaxer. He also uses a small 10-inch snare as his main piece for a more electronic sound.
