"Max Edward Dinning was born in Manchester, Oklahoma, the youngest of nine children, and was raised on a farm near Nashville, Tennessee, after his family relocated from Kansas.

"His recording efforts met with limited success until 1959, when ""Teen Angel"" became a hit. The lyrics, which told of the death of a teenage girl, were deemed by British radio stations to be too morbid to be aired, but it reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. In the U.S., it reached number one on the Billboard charts in early February 1960. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. He also was the original artist to record ""What Will My Mary Say,"" a song later popularized by Johnny Mathis in 1963.

"Dinning had an alcohol addiction, which restricted his performances, and caused promoters to stop booking him as he faded from public view. Although Dinning never duplicated the success of ""Teen Angel"", he had three minor hit records in the ensuing years.
