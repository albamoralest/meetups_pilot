"In a radio interview, in 2002, Sexton said that the version of the film Black Hawk Down, in which he briefly appeared, which made it onto theater screens was significantly different from the one recounted in the original script. According to him, many scenes asking hard questions of the U.S. troops with regard to the violent realities of war, the true purpose of their mission in Somalia, etc., were cut out. Sexton has said in interviews that speaking out against the film led to him getting ""blacklisted"" and prevented him from getting work in major films.
