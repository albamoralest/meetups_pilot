"Whitman studied computer music at Berklee College of Music, where he was exposed to modern electronic music composition and synthesis (Whitman claims that before this he was initially drawn to making music by listening to the radio in the New York city suburbs in the early 1980s). His moniker ASCIII has released music distributed with an academic journal. His studio and live setup usually consists of a PowerBook running Max/MSP or Logic Pro, and other analogue instruments, such as guitars, ouds and synthesizers.
