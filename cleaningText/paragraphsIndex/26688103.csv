"At 13, Saller was invited by his older brother Ryan to join a band started by some of his friends, Dan Jacobs and Alex Varkatzas. The three of them formed a street punk band called Retribution, which by 1998, had adapted a heavier sound and changed names to Atreyu after the main character of The Neverending Story. The band signed to Victory Records in 2001 and released 3 albums under the label, Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses in 2002, The Curse in 2004, and A Death-Grip on Yesterday in 2006. The band later joined major label Hollywood Records and released 2007's Lead Sails Paper Anchor and 2009's Congregation of the Damned.  After over 10 years of worldwide success, the band embarked on hiatus, but returned in 2014. They released their sixth studio album, Long Live in 2015.

"Saller did not sing on the band's 1998 EP, Visions, as he only played drums for the band at that time. Between Visions and  Fractures in the Facade of Your Porcelain Beauty, Saller learned to sing while playing drums and became the band's clean vocalist. On Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, his vocals were largely confined to choruses, however, as Atreyu's career went on, Saller's vocals would get more and more frequent, and they would become a major part of Atreyu's sound. After the departure of Atreyu vocalist Alex Varkatzas, Saller began performing as the band's primary vocalist.
