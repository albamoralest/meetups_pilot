"Richards began playing classical piano at age ten and concentrated on jazz from age sixteen after hearing Fats Waller. His first major professional gig was with Tab Smith at the Savoy Ballroom in New York City from 1945 to 1949. Following this he played with Bob Wilber (1950–51) and Sidney Bechet (1951). He toured Italy and France in 1953 with Mezz Mezzrow's band alongside Buck Clayton and Big Chief Moore, also accompanying Frank Sinatra in Italy. He played with Muggsy Spanier intermittently from 1953 through the end of the decade and with Fletcher Henderson in 1957–58. In 1958, he performed as a solo act in Columbus, Ohio, then played with Wild Bill Davison in 1958–59 and again in 1962. In 1960 he formed Saints & Sinners with Vic Dickenson, playing with this band until 1970. He joined jazz drummer Chuck Slate and his band in 1971 and stayed with him most of the year. He recorded an album with Slate called Bix 'n' All That Jazz.  Following this he worked with Eddie Condon (1975–77), then led a trio in 1977–78. He played with Panama Francis and the Savoy Sultans worldwide from 1979 through the 1980s. He recorded with Bill Coleman in 1980. He continued to tour near to the time of his death in March 1998, in New York.
