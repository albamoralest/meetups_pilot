"In 1987, Bourgeois Tagg recorded the record ""Yoyo"" with esteemed producer Todd Rundgren. When it was released in the autumn of that year, the band had what would prove to be their biggest hit with its first single ""I Don't Mind at All,"" written by Workman and band co-founder Brent Bourgeois, which peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100. A shimmering, melancholy ballad of resignation, the song's catchy melody, offbeat rhythm, and dramatic use of strings has been said to be reminiscent of classic Beatles songs such as ""Yesterday"" and especially ""Across the Universe."" Although the single just briefly made the Top 40 in the United States, it was a Top Five hit on the Adult Contemporary chart, and a major hit worldwide. Its success was fueled by an innovative video directed by David Fincher that received heavy airplay on MTV and other music video outlets.
