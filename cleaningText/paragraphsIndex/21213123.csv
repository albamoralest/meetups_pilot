"Roth received much international critical acclaim for his 2004 solo debut Someone Somewhere.... Throughout the nineties he had an ongoing collaboration with poet rocker Jim Carroll, resulting in two songs on Carroll's Pools of Mercury and Carroll's EP Runaway. Roth also collaborated on Carroll's Kill Rock Stars in 2000, which coincided with a sold-out show at the Seattle Opera House. Their song ""Falling Down Laughing"" was added to the soundtrack to the 2008 film Obscene alongside Bob Dylan, the Doors and Patti Smith. Roth also played Mellotron on Built to Spill's Perfect from Now On. Roth is working on the first new Truly record in over ten years as well as new solo material and continues to play live shows with Truly, his solo band as well as alone on acoustic guitar and piano.
