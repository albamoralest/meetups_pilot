"At age 14, Taube began playing guitar. While traveling throughout Europe, he developed an interest in folklore and folk music. He performed in concerts on Swedish radio while a student at the Royal Beskow School in Stockholm. Taube graduated in 1954 from the Cherry Lawn School in Darien, Connecticut.  While he was a student at the school, Folkways Records invited him to record an album of Swedish folk songs. Taube has been married four times, and has four children, born in 1960, 1965, 1979, and 1994. He belongs to an untitled branch of the Baltic German noble Taube family, introduced at the Swedish House of Nobility in 1668 as noble family No. 734.

"Taube released his first album in 1954; it included a cover of one of his father's songs. He has since released many albums which include songs written by his father. Several of his most well-known versions of Evert Taube songs come from albums recorded in the 1970s, but he recorded more of them at later stages, including his 2007 album Alderville Road.  Referring to that album, reviewer Peter Dahlgren said, ""Evert had the yarns and Sven-Bertil had the voice.""

"He has recorded songs from both Fredman's Epistles and Fredman's Songs by the popular Swedish 18th-century songwriter Carl Michael Bellman, Paul Britten Austin wrote in his 1967 biography of Bellman that Sven-Bertil Taube's two Bellman albums (released in 1960 and 1963) ""have sold more copies than any other disc, popular or classical, ever released in Sweden"". Göran Forsling wrote that Taube helped to start ""a new era in Bellman interpretation around 1960"", like Fred Åkerström giving the songs ""a hitherto unheard earthbound realism"". Taube recorded work by the poet Nils Ferlin (1898–1961), whose poems were mostly put to music by Lille Bror Söderlundh. Taube also recorded an album with songs by the Swedish songwriter and musician Ulf Peder Olrog, one with Swedish translations of songs by French songwriter Léo Ferré, and one with Swedish translations of songs by Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis.
