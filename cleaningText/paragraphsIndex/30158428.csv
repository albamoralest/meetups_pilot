"DELS was described as the ""Future of UK Hip Hop"" by British national newspaper The Times in their ""Ones to Watch 2011"" list in January 2011. Paul Lester of The Guardian has complimented Dickins for his ability to set himself apart from many homogeneous hip-hop artists by sounding both languid and urgent. Lester has described Dickins as ""Dizzee mixed with the Bj√∂rk of Vespertina"". DELS has received positive media coverage from BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music DJs such as Zane Lowe, Annie Mac, Huw Stephens, Reggie Yates, Huey Morgan and Lauren Laverne.

"I met most of the people that contributed to this album on MySpace back in 2005. We had a page called ""Loners"", where myself and the likes of Kwes, Micachu, Ghostpoet, Sampha, Coby Sey, Elan Tamara and others were all featured. We always said that we'd do a proper album together eventually. Petals Have Fallen is probably the closest thing to that happening to date.
