"The Daily Telegraph's Ivan Hewett wrote on the originality of Trotignon's style in 2009 that ""Any references are only subliminally present in a style that's very much his own. He has certain favourite devices such as rapid-fire repetitions of single notes, and machine-gun alternations of the hands"". The Guardian's John Fordham, commenting on a Trotignon duo concert with percussionist Minino Garay stated that the pianist's playing contained ""startling chordal exclamations, plaintively romantic lyricism and [...] a collage of liquid lines and stuttering drumlike invitations to his partner"".
