"Ginny has appeared at Birmingham's SHOUT Festival of Queer Arts and Culture. They appeared on The X Factor in 2017. While competing on Ru Paul's Drag Race UK, Ginny Lemon eliminated themself from the competition in a lip sync round with fellow competitor Sister Sister. They have since said that they felt uncomfortable with some of the judges' comments, arguing that RuPaul and Michelle Visage did not understand British humour, and pushed Ginny towards a female-orientated concept of glamour. Ginny Lemon also criticised RuPaul's emotional outburst on the show, where RuPaul criticised Joe Black's outfit (which occurred after Ginny had left), tweeting: ""Screaming and swearing at desperate out of work queens for being too regional and unable to afford costumes after 7 months of jobless despair... Nah babz Iâ€™m better off at home fank u very much"". In February 2022, Lemon will embark on RuPaul's Drag Race UK: The Official Tour alongside the entire cast of the second series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, in association with World of Wonder and promoter Voss Events. In January 2022, Lemon appeared alongside fellow cast member and friend Sister Sister on series 7 of E4's Celebrity Coach Trip, joining fellow celebrity travellers in Portugal like Matt Richardson, Honey G, Paul Danan, The Honeyz and Birds of a Feather stars Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph.</ref>
