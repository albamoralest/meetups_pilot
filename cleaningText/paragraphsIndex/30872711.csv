"Mononc' Serge (real name Serge Robert) is a Québécois musician and poet who sings in French. He is best known for his vulgar lyrics and his irreverent songs making fun of local celebrities and politicians. He is also quite sardonic with the Quebec federalist movement, and their counterparts in the Rest Of Canada (R.O.C.). ""Mononc' Serge"" is French for ""Uncle Serge"".
