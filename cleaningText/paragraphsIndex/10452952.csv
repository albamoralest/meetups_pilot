"Chin's ""activist driven"" work has garnered praise in various publications. Of her one-woman show Border/Clash, The New York Times wrote that Chin ""is sassy, rageful and sometimes softly self-mocking."" The Advocate wrote, ""With poems that combine hilarious one-liners (""I told her I liked the way she made that pink push-up bra look intellectual"") with a refusal to conform (""I want to be the dyke who likes to fuck men""), Chin is out to confront more than just the straight world."" In the book, Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam, author Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz referred to Chin as ""definitely the prize to win"" among the three New York City Poetry Slam venues during the years she competed, adding:

"To watch Chin perform is to watch the very essence of poetry manifested: her performances are imperfect, volatile and beautiful. Chin's poetry is passionate and well-written, sure; but it's her ability to communicate that passion in performance that is unparalleled. She becomes the poetry.
