"On January 4, 2013, it was announced that he had left Anthrax, reportedly in order to focus on studio production work for a while until he figured his next move as an artist. He said of his decision to leave ""This is an extremely difficult and emotional decision for me to make but my heart is just steering me in a different direction right now. I've always been one to follow my heart in everything that I do and while this might be one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make, it feels like the right one for me at this time.""On February 4, 2013, it was announced that Caggiano had officially joined Danish band Volbeat as lead guitarist. Originally called on as the record producer for Volbeat's new album Outlaw Gentlemen and Shady Ladies, Caggiano was asked to join as a full-time member two weeks into the recording process due to the chemistry between him and the other band members. In addition, Caggiano has also recently joined forces with singer Dani Filth, bass player King ov Hell as well as drummer John Tempesta in a new band, Temple of the Black Moon, which is actively recording.
