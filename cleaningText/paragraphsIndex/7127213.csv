"Travis Shook (born March 10, 1969 in Oroville, California) is a jazz pianist who made his eponymous Columbia Records debut in a quartet that included Tony Williams and Bunky Green. He received much critical acclaim for this first effort, but failed to hold on to the contract when Sony purged a large percentage of the Columbia jazz roster upon acquiring the label in 1993.  After spending some time as a member of the Betty Carter Trio, he dropped out of the public eye for a number of years.
