"Originally known as the Timex Crew, members included Marcus Thompson (founder), Gregory ""Greg B"" Thomas, Michael Marshall, Craig Samuel, and Darrien Cleage. By 1986, Samuel, Cleage, and Thomas had departed, Alex Hill and Kevin Moore were added, and the name Timex Social Club was adopted (despite the group's name, Timex Group USA bears no sponsorship of the group). Later in 1986, Ocea Savage was added on keyboards and background vocals. They fused funk and urban R&B with Washington go-go beat.
