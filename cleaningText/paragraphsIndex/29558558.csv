"Known first by the moniker Beyond and later as Musab, Sab the Artist was a member of the Headshots crew before he, along with Slug (Sean Daley), Ant (Anthony Davis) and Siddiq (Brent Sayers), founded indie hip hop label Rhymesayers Entertainment. In 1996, Beyond had the label's very first release Comparison. In 1999, he released Be-Sides. Dynospectrum's self-titled debut album was also released that year. In 2002, Respect the Life, his first studio album as Musab, was released on Rhymesayers. The 2007 album Slicks Box was Sab's first official project not released by Rhymesayers, instead coming on Oakland-based Hieroglyphics Imperium Recordings. Long known as a hip hop artist, Sab's recent projects, including his 2010 EP Sab the Artist and the full-length album H.G.H. (Heaven, Girls, Hell) he is currently working with Ultra Chorus of Minneapolis, MN are instead a fusion of ""Hip Hop, Pop, R&B, and Electronic sounds"".
