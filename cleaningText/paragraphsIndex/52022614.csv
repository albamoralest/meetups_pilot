"In 2012, rock band CKY announced that they were hiring Davies to replace founding vocalist Deron Miller after disagreements with Miller had put the future of the band in uncertainty. Davies fronted the group as a touring member in 2012, and fronted the group again in 2015 for a performance at Amnesia Rockfest in Montebello, Quebec. The band initially stated their intentions to record with Davies as vocalist, however announced in 2016 that they would be recording a new album as a trio, presumably without Davies.

"In 2014, Davies' godfather, director John Carpenter, began work on an album of instrumental music entitled Lost Themes.  The initial work was a collaboration between Carpenter and his son Cody, but after the younger Carpenter went to Japan to teach, Carpenter brought in Davies to continue collaboration on the album, with Davies playing guitar and contributing as a songwriter and co-producer to the project.  The album was released by Sacred Bones Records in 2015. In 2016, Carpenter followed up Lost Themes with the album Lost Themes II.  The album again featured Davies' contributions, as well as Cody Carpenter's. While recording the album, the trio also scored the main titles for the CBS television series Zoo. Carpenter toured to support Lost Themes II throughout 2016, with Davies as a member of his touring band. He composed the music for the 2018 film Halloween, with Carpenter and his son Cody.
