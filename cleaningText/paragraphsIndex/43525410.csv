"Shea had been friends with comedian Lenny Bruce and had photographed Bruce on more than one occasion. One photograph taken in 1966 of Lenny and Kitty Bruce was used without attribution and without copyright notice by Fantasy Records on the album, Live at the Curran Theater, recorded in 1961 but not released until 1971. Shea discussed the violation with Fantasy representative Ralph J. Gleason in 1972, but he did not seek a copyright remedy in court until 2002. At that time Shea's claim was dismissed after a successful laches argument by Fantasy lawyers . Shea died in 2004 from metastatic esophageal cancer.
