"Musa's debut novel Here Come The Dogs was published by Penguin Books (Australia) in 2014. The story centres around the lives of three disaffected young men in small town Australia. The Guardian Australia described it as examining ""race, identity and the unrealised dreams of disempowered Australian youths"". The Los Angeles Times said it was ""rousing"" and ""searing"", and that ""with compassion and urgency, Here Come the Dogs excavates the pain of those who struggle to remain part of a ruthless equation that has been determined by others."" Here Come the Dogs was nominated for numerous awards, such as the Miles Franklin Award and the International Dublin Literary Award, and won the People's Choice Award at the ACT Book of the Year Awards. Musa was named one of the Sydney Morning Herald's Young Novelists of the Year and short-listed for the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards in 2015.

Musa's work often deals with the themes of migration, Australian racism, violence, masculinity and loneliness.
