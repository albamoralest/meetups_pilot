",1,== Biography ==
"Walker grew up in Stamford, Lincolnshire, England, attending Stamford School.  His first live performance was at the local Methodist youth club with trumpeter Ian Starsmore.  Then, with guitarist Peter Banks, fronting the 'Slendermen' at school dances, their first major concert in December 1964 included a song by Sam Cooke, during which news came on the radio of Cooke's murder in Los Angeles. While studying at university and qualifying as a secondary schoolteacher, Walker became a church organist, wrote a number of choral settings and chants, dabbled in folk with a residency at King's Lynn Folk Club, and led several small bands (Shades of Harmony, Tristars, Millionaires).  He made his first pop singles for independent labels, including 'GCE for Love', 'First Class Faker' and 'Jane', collaborating with Parisian songwriter Nicolas Bensaid.  Teaching in Victoria, Australia, Walker continued writing and performing across the state with rock group 'Apollo 5', led by guitarist Geoff Stobie.
