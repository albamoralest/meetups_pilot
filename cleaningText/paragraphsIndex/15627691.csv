"Born in Alberta, Canada on January 10, 1979, but raised in California, he resided in Texas and currently lives in Atlanta. Sho Baraka was introduced to hip hop at a young age. Living in Southern California during the height of gangsta rap presented its challenges to many youths, as well as Sho. In high school Sho and some friends from his neighborhood formed a rap group that began touring with major recording artists. But his life took a different turn after the rap group fizzled out and close friends were killed or incarcerated due to the gang life they led. He decided to heed his father's advice and apply to college, pursuing education instead of the streets. There he came into contact with Lecrae and Tedashii and eventually the 116 Clique and Reach Records were formed.
