"Icey was born in Florida. Originally named DJ Icee, he had to change his name because a local Orlando ice cream manufacturing company by the same name threatened to sue him. Known for marrying the diverse strands of Chicago Hip house and English break-beat house, he rose to prominence DJing for the now defunct Orlando club ""The Edge,"" a position he held from 1991 to 1996. In 1993, he created his own label, Zone, named in honor of the UK labels O-Zone and D-Zone. In 2000, CMJ New Music Monthly described him as ""an expert in funky, sped-up hip-hop"", and by 2001, Billboard was listing him along with Crystal Method, DJ Micro and Ãœberzone as ""perennial figure[s] in the burgeoning funky breaks underground scene.""DJ Icey released his own music under his name and City Wide Allstars, and also remixed music for Groove Armada, Paul Oakenfold and Kosheen.
