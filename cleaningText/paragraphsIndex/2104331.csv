"On January 27, 2005, while on tour in London, England, Summers suffered an emotional breakdown and reportedly tried to commit suicide by jumping from a hotel window while under the influence of PCP. When people in his entourage stopped him, he was restrained and locked in a first floor room. While in that room, Summers gouged his left eye out with a plastic fork. After the incident, Summers was arrested by London police and was sent to a rehablitation facility. After a two-week stint in rehab, Houston went home to Los Angeles and apologized for the incident. Houston attributed the incident to stress caused by the music industry, saying ""Everything was clobbering down on me. Everything was going a little bit too hard on me"".
