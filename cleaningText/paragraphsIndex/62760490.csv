"Diego Baldenweg with Nora Baldenweg & Lionel Baldenweg is a Swiss/Australian composer trio. They were the first Swiss composers to be nominated for the World Soundtrack Awards (Public Choice) in 2019. Their musical range often moves within classic orchestral, subtle electronics and lyrical/non-lyrical vocals. The siblings work together as a team (Diego Baldenweg (composer), Nora Baldenweg (co-composer), Lionel Baldenweg (co-composer)) and together they founded the music production company GREAT GARBO in 2004. Since then the siblings have composed and produced the music to over 300 international advertising campaigns for brands such as Carlsberg, Mastercard, Nivea, Sony and Dove. They have composed music for many films such as Otfried Preußler's bestselling children's book adaptation ""The Little Witch"" starring Karoline Herfurth, the film La Femme et le TGV starring Jane Birkin and for Til Schweiger's US remake of his German film Head Full of Honey starring Nick Nolte, Matt Dillon and Emily Mortimer.
