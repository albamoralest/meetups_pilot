"After the critical and commercial success of 2000's Gozo Poderoso, which landed Aterciopelados on the Top 10 of the Billboard Top Latin Albums Sales chart as well as a coveted appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Echeverri took time off for the birth of her first child Milagros, who has proven to be a new point of artistic inspiration. The result is the self-titled album Andrea Echeverri, her first solo release. The disc was produced by Héctor Buitrago from Aterciopelados and mixed by Thom Russo (Juanes, Kinky, Johnny Cash), and also features a remix from Richard Blair (Sidestepper).

"On ""A Eme O"", the album's upbeat first single, Echeverri sings “Since you were born, I've become a better lover. Its as if you've unplugged my tubes.” On the chill-out lullaby track ""Baby Blues"" (which was featured in the soundtrack for the film La mujer de mi hermano), she observes the bond between mother and daughter as Milagros cries late at night. ""Some songs are written for Milagros, but they sound like they're written for a lover,"" said Andrea. Going ever further, she satirizes the highly sexualized lyrics of the Colombian genre called champeta, naming one of the album's tracks ""Lactochampeta"".  “It's kind of a joke, because it has explicit lyrics about lactating,” muses Andrea.
