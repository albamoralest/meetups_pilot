After the dissolving of Candle Records, he has started his own pseudo-label called Flippin Yeah Records in 2008. He self-published his first 'zine in late 2017. Hanlon is known for his engagement with his audiences, through his down-to-earth storytelling at live gigs. He has toured with the Weather Station, Michael Hurley, Billy Bragg, David Dondero, Tim Kasher, Violent Femmes, The Magnetic Fields, and Courtney Barnett. Described as having ""a certain brilliance"", Hanlon has also been praised as ""a spectacular songwriter; able to create a whole scene from the sum of its subtleties and wit interspersed with poignant moments.""In 2015 Hanlon released his fifth solo album, Where Did You Come From? Songs were recorded in New Orleans, Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Nashville and Clarksdale, with an array of musicians he met along the way, from instrumentalists of popular music Spooner Oldham, David Hood, Howard Grimes, to unknown buskers and street musicians. Hanlon performs Christmas concerts in December of each year, and has done since 2005. The shows, mostly held in churches and halls, routinely sell out each year.
