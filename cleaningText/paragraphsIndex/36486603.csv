"Born in Portugal, she immigrated to New York and briefly attended Columbia University before becoming a Rockette. She then had a solo dancing career and eventually became a choreographer. This led to her involvement with the American Theatre Wing Hospital Committee producing entertainment for hospitalized servicemen during World War II. She recruited cartoonists to give chalk talks, and the ensuing camaraderie they enjoyed doing them eventually encouraged creation of the National Cartoonists Society. As the troubleshooter for the association she gained experience that allowed a segue into a career (as Toni Mendez, Inc.) handling business affairs for cartoonists and eventually branching out to also handling writers and illustrators.
