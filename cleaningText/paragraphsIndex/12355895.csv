"Sarah Johns was born in Pollard, Kentucky. She began singing regularly while attending the University of Kentucky. In early 2006, Sarah Johns signed to Show Dog Nashville (now Show Dog-Universal Music), a record label owned by Toby Keith. Although she toured with Keith on his Big Throwdown 2 tour, she did not release anything on Show Dog, and left the label that April. A year later, Johns signed with BNA Records. She released her debut single ""The One in the Middle"" on April 30, 2007 and made Top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts with it. On June 2, 2007, Johns made her debut on the Grand Ole Opry. Johns' debut album, Big Love in a Small Town, was released on August 28, 2007 and peaked at No. 198 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic critic Thom Jurek rated the album three stars out of five, comparing Johns' song choices and attitudes to those of Tammy Wynette and Gretchen Wilson and saying, ""This record isn't all the way there, but it's well on the way and might blow up the charts anyway. Big Love in a Small Town is an auspicious debut by a young talent."" Its second single, ""He Hates Me"", peaked at No. 47 on the country charts.
