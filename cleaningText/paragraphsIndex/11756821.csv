"Acoustic Syndicate is a roots-rock/Americana band from North Carolina that has been an active part of the rock music scene since forming in 1992. They have toured nationally in the US, including appearances at Farm Aid Jazzfest MerleFest and the Bonnaroo Music Festival.  Their sound is characterized by three-part vocal blood harmony and complex polyrhythmic banjo playing. Although they are known for featuring traditional acoustic instruments, Acoustic Syndicate's early influences in rock, jazz and reggae surface throughout their approach to songwriting with electric guitar, electric bass and saxophone instrumentation often appearing. Lyrically, the group often discusses themes relating to subsistence, sustainability, social justice and quality of life. Their live touring act is a popular draw to festivals, theaters, clubs, and performing arts centers.
