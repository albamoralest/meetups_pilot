"Shawty Redd is known for his traditional trap style and ominous, horror-influenced melodies and chord progressions.  A good example of this is his production on Trap House and Let's Get It: Thug Motivation 101.  He can also compose melodic instrumentals similar to his work on Snoop Dogg's ""Sensual Seduction"".
