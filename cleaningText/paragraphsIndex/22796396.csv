"When he was 16, Jiménez was writing quality music, but his father discouraged him from music, saying he needed to get a real job. After several years of trying, an opportunity appeared and Jimenez appeared on the CD La Alianza in 2004. Afterward, he was given the chance to record several songs, which later became number one hits in Panama. In 2007, Jimenez signed with Panama Music and recorded his first album as a solo singer: Te Amo Rosemary, which features the songs ""Yo Quisiera Vivir"", ""Te Va a Doler"", ""Te Amo"" and ""Déjame Entrar"".
