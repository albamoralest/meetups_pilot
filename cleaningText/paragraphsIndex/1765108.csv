"Bell was singing in Houston night clubs at age ten, and credits seeing the performances of Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke as influencing him to become a singer. He formed the Drells in 1956 while in junior high school. He became known around the world for the hit that he had with the Drells, ""Tighten Up"". He has pursued a solo career since the breakup of the Drells in 1980. Bell later released one solo album (I Never Had It So Good – 1981) on Beckett Records and continued to perform with The Drells off and on for the next twenty years. During the 1990s the line-up also included Steve ""Stevie G."" Guettler (guitar, vocals), Jeff ""JT"" Strickler (bass guitar, vocals), Steve Farrell (guitar, vocals), Mike Wilson (keyboards, vocals) and Wes Armstrong (drums, vocals) of the Atlanta-based group The Rockerz.

"In more recent times Bell has been diversifying his repertoire to include blues, and has recorded a blues album. He has also recorded some country music, having professed a love for that genre. Tommy Allsup, country producer and former member of Bob Wills' Texas Playboys, recruited Bell to sing ""Warm Red Wine"", which appeared on an album with songs from Glen Campbell, Tanya Tucker and Roy Clark.
