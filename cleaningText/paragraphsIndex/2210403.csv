"He formerly co-wrote and co-produced a few of the band's songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed one of their songs, which is called ""Woman"", on Call and Response: The Remix Album, released in 2008. On August 31, 2012 - during a show in Argentina on the Overexposed Tour - Farrar filled-in for Mickey Madden on the bass guitar for the very first time. He subsequently filled-in for Madden on the next few shows of the tour. After touring with the band as a touring member for the next couple of years, Farrar appeared in an official, promotional photo of Maroon 5 for the first time, in late 2016. He is also featured on the cover of the band's sixth studio album, Red Pill Blues (2017) - all of this can be seen as confirmation, that Farrar became an official member of Maroon 5, making them a seven-piece band.
