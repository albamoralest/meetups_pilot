Touring in the African country, Natalie met  Italian impresario Flavio Demichelis, who invited her to collaborate in Italy. In the 2006 she signed contract and later released a new song Che donna vorei. It was success in the eyes of critics. In the 2009 Natalie came to Ukraine, where she met her love. This fact influenced Natalie's music tastes and she tried to sing on the EDM tracks.
