"Jaramillo was born on October 1, 1935, in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Son of Juan Pantaleón Jaramillo Erazo and Apolonia Laurido Cáceres. His parents moved to Guayaquil from the town of Machachi in search for a better life. He had two siblings, a sister who died at the age of 5 and a brother named Pepe. Their neighbor Ignacio Toapanta let the kids play with his musical instruments, and taught them to play the guitar. Julio later made his own guitar out of bamboo so that he could practice more. Attending the school led by Francisco García Avilés  was probably the final push towards Julio's musical career.

" With the recording of his first album, ""Mi pobre querida Madre"" (1954), which was a duet with Fresia Saavedra, his name began to be well-known. This was followed by the Peruvian-style waltz song called ""Esposa (wife)"" (1955), a duet with Carlos Rubira Infante. In 1956, the Peruvian-style waltz Fatalidad(music by Laureano Martínez Smart, text by Juan Sixto Prieto) marked his breakthrough. It's something between a Peruvian waltz and an Ecuadorian ""pasillo."" It was a huge success from the very beginning — 6000 copies were sold within a week. By the end of 1956, he had produced a dozen albums under the Onyx label. In 1959, he moved to TV and also the movies. His first film was Mala Mujer or ""Wicked Woman"". He gained international recognition after the bolero ""Nuestro Juramento"" (1957), and he made several tours in Latin America. He began a journey through Ecuador, Colombia, Perú, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile. The Mexican label Peerless became interested in him and sent him on a tour of Peru and Chile. In Colombia, he met up with his brother Pepe, who had previously emigrated to that country. When not on tour, he performed in movie theaters in Guayaquil (it was customary at that time to perform concerts before the main feature). Because of his immense popularity, he started to do pre-movie shows on Saturdays and Sundays, which later became two daily shows, seven days a week. Upon returning to Ecuador, he was arrested and forced into military service.

"His last international tour was held in the United States and Canada. The scandals of his turbulent life were often also a source of news. He was imprisoned on several occasions, almost always due to crimes against women or noncompliance with the Juvenile Court. Besides being married five times, Julio had children with other women: it's estimated he had up to twenty-eight children. He never denied his humble origins, was always very generous and lavish with his friends, and a stereotype of machismo from his early upbringing.

"On his return to Ecuador in 1975, tired, prematurely aged and corroded by cirrhosis, he was booed at a performance in his hometown because his voice was no longer the same. In his last years of his life, Julio Jaramillo had a radio program at Crystal Radio entitled ""The J.J. Hour"", whose commercial time did not even generate enough money for him to make a decent living.
",13,== Biography == | === Operation ===
"During the early days of the month of February 1978, Julio Jaramillo underwent a highly risky medical procedure to remove gallstones. The procedure was successful, but during the postoperative period he was imprudent enough to pull the probes connected to his body. This caused a peritonitis which forced doctors to perform a second operation. However, because of the years as a bohemian and neglect, his body did not respond as expected.

"Jaramillo died at the young age of 42. His remains were given a farewell like no other person has known in Guayaquil. It is estimated that there were about 250,000 Ecuadorians at his funeral.

Since 1993, his birthday has been commemorated as a national holiday for the pasillo: Día del Pasillo Ecuatoriano (Day of the Ecuadorian Pasillo).
