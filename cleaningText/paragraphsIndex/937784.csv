Eventually he began playing original songs in his bands, and joined a band called Spike by age 16 that was strictly playing originals.  In 1977 he started a new band called FireFoxx along with Ron Abrams on guitar and Bobby Blotzer on drums. Croucier served as bassist for Ratt during the 1980s, and was also very briefly in Quiet Riot and DuBrow. Croucier played with Quiet Riot shortly before Randy Rhoads left to play with Ozzy Osbourne and played with DuBrow in 1981 but did not record with either. Before he left DuBrow he introduced band leader Kevin DuBrow to Frankie Banali. They went on to form a new version of Quiet Riot, resulting in the debut record Metal Health.
