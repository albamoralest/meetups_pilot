"In 1999, Tamaki attended dance school and learned how to perform on stage. She auditioned for Sony Music Japan in 2001 when she was thirteen years old where she performed cover songs of the Destiny's Child hit ""Survivor"" and ""Full Moon Prayer"" by Core of Soul. She was selected out of 1,000 applicants and started her career in 2003 with her debut single ""Believe"" which was an opening song for the anime Mobile Suit Gundam Seed. Her follow-up single, ""Realize"", was also used in the series. The popularity of the Gundam franchise, and the inclusion of her work within it, helped her gain immediate popularity as a singer. Her first concert performance was opening for T.M. Revolution at the Pacific Media Expo in 2004.  She released her first studio album, Greeting, and was hailed as a J-pop princess.

"In 2008, Nami's live events were in full motion. Nami's fourth album, Don't Stay, was released on April 23, 2008, containing songs from her singles ""Brightdown"", ""Cross Season"", and ""Winter Ballades"", as well as some new tracks. The album did not chart or sell as well as her previous albums. Coinciding with the release, Nami held a special live tour ""Anniversary Live 5,"" which took place in Tokyo and Osaka. A lengthy period with a lack of new material followed after the album's release, although Nami remained occupied with various concerts. Speculation and rumors surfaced about Nami leaving Sony Music Japan to join another record label. During a live performance on September 22, 2008 at ""Girls Entertainment vol.1"", Nami confirmed the transfer but could not give further details.

"In 2014, Nami announced that she had become frustrated as she was having trouble singing her songs. She then went on to state that she had been struggling with sinitus since a young age and had regularly been receiving treatment, but decided to get surgery to fix the problem. Once recovered, she said that she felt good and no longer had problems. However, in 2015 she was diagnosed with vocal nodules as she had been having pain while singing once again. Tamaki stated that she would be receiving treatment during her current activities and that her plans for her upcoming musical would continue as planned. Due to her condition, she had to cut back her performance set-list while promoting for Everlasting Love.
