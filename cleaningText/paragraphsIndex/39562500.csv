"Larry Hernández (born March 10, 1977) is a Mexican-American singer songwriter, and television personality known for his work in the Regional Mexican music genre, specifically in the styles of Banda, Norteño and Norteño-Banda. Hernandez's biggest influence and idol is the late Chalino Sanchez, but he also feels admiration for many artists and his musical influences have a big range. He is a distant cousin of fellow Regional Mexican artist, El Potro de Sinaloa.

"At the age of four, Hernandez's parents took him to a small town called Pueblos Unidos-Estación Opispo, in Culiacán, where he grew up for most of his adolescence. At a young age, Hernandez had musical aspirations. At the age of eight, he would compose his own corridos and play them to all of his family members in order to learn from their critiques. Hernandez's musical influence came from his family, but he taught himself how to write and compose songs. To help with his music career, Hernandez attended a music school in Culiacán, where he played for a group of musicians who represented Sinaloa called Los Amables del Norte. He would soon join the band as their drummer. Performing with Los Amables del Norte gave Hernandez experience playing in front of a crowd, but it was his solo career that sparked his fame.

"In 1998, Hernandez conducted his first recordings which were composed of 65 songs in a tribute to Cornelio Reyna. Later, in 1999, Hernandez recorded his first solo album, ""Contella Norteña."" Afterwards, Hernandez recorded eight more albums; ""Mil Noches"" in 2001, ""El Amigo de Todos"" in 2003, ""Linda Chuiquilla"" in 2004, ""Labrinto"" and ""Arrepiente"" in 2005, ""Se Busca Cantar Buenos Corridos"" in 2006, and ""Hace un Mes"" and ""Dejate Querer Tantito"" in 2008. It wasn’t until 2009 when Hernandez's fame became elevated with his release of ""16 Narco Corridos,"" which only took Hernandez one day to record, hitting the top billboard charts, and reaching the rank of number four on the Billboard Top Latin Albums. After the release of this album, Hernandez's musical career began to rise.

"With the release of the ""16 Narco Corridos,"" Hernandez became a mainstream Latino artist. The record sold over 300,000 albums, boosting Hernandez's career. The album was written almost entirely by Hernandez and recorded in a single day. The album features vivid depictions of drug trafficking culture and it reached the top number four spot on Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.  His album ""En Vivo: Desde Culiacán"" followed later in 2009 and climbed to the number two spot on Billboard Top Latin Albums confirming his status as a Latino star. Some people have criticized his lyrics, to which he replied, ""My 'corridos' aren't made to start controversy with anyone, they are made to entertain people, so they drink and have a good time. In reality, the economy and the whole world are going through tough times; the only thing I can give people is my talent and a good time so they forget everything and enjoy themselves."" Although in his career as a soloist he recorded seven albums without major recognition, his musical catalyst occurred by means of social networking and through viral YouTube response which his fans supported. The public that already knew of him began to talk about him on internet blogs and music based websites, and upload his music videos.  With the increase in his following, he was converted into a true Latino music idol. His fame then caught the attention of large music industry record labels and he signed a contract with the transnational record label Universal Music Latin Entertainment which has helped him continue his successful career and led to the transition to other avenues of mass media.
