"Prior to his role in Fear Factory, Bell was in the band Hateface. In 1989, after Hateface disbanded, his housemate Dino Cazares invited him to meet a drummer (Raymond Herrera) to possibly work with. On October 31, 1990, Bell, Cazares, Herrera and Romero jammed for the first time in a studio in South Los Angeles.

This line-up recorded two albums. During the following period of inactivity within the band, Cazares and Bell patched up their differences, and in 2009 decided to have Fear Factory return to form.

After 31 years as the singer of Fear Factory, Bell announced on September 28, 2020 that he had left the band, citing ""consistent series of dishonest representations and unfounded accusations from past and present band members"" and a bitter feud between himself and Cazares.
