"Born in Wolverhampton, England, Swift's musical experience began in the local school choir and church as a singer. Throughout his childhood Swift was exposed to the acoustic guitar, which both of his brothers played in trio's childhood home. His musical interest piqued, Swift was fourteen when he decided to take up the trombone at school. In his hometown, the demand for bassists was on the rise, and Swift volunteered to join local bands. Swift's trombone teacher saw how quickly Swift progressed on bass guitar and encouraged him to also pursue the double bass, knowing that Swift would benefit from the ability to play both instruments as a professional musician.
