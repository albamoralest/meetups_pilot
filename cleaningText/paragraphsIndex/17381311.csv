",1,== Biography ==
"Noel Richards is Welsh. He was born in Llantrisant near Cardiff. When he was eight or nine years old, he became a Christian. He entered into a deeper sense of commitment to God at the age of fifteen, following which he began to look upon John Glass as a role model. John Glass was a young pastor who had just arrived at Richards' church from Bible college. Glass taught Richards to play the guitar, sing and to present himself.

"Glass introduced Richards to the contemporary Christian music of that time, in 1971. Richards attended his first Christian music concert at the Colston Hall, Bristol. The event called ""It's Buzz"" was hosted by Pete Meadows. One of the performers at the event was Graham Kendrick. While watching Kendrick perform at the event, Richards thought to himself that that was what he wanted to do. Following this event, Richards began singing at his own church. He also accompanied John Glass and other members of his own church when they set out on trips to other churches. On one of these trips, Glass introduced Richards to the man who was running the Youth for Christ operations in Bristol. This introduction became a turning point in Richards' life, as he became involved with evangelism before finally devoting his life to ministry.
