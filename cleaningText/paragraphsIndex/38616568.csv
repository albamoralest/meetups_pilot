"Hagibis (Filipino word meaning ""velocity"", ""speed"" or 'swiftness"") is a Filipino disco group best known for their macho image, on-stage costumes, and macho songs about women. Originally formed by Juan dela Cruz Band singer and bassist Mike Hanopol and Vic del Rosario, they are cited as the ""First Boyband in the Philippines"" and later were coined the title ""Village People of the Philippines"", a title they still hold to this day. Their original line-up were composed of Sonny Parsons, Bernie Fineza, Mike Respall, Joji Garcia and Mon Picazo.

Hanopol also revealed in the same interview that he also sung the band's recorded songs himself. Parsons also said during Hagibis' guest appearance on Tonight with Arnold Clavio, that he originally auditioned for VST & Co. before joining Hagibis. The group borrowed some elements of the American disco group, Village People, such the line dancing, the leather clothing, accompany with motorcycles.
