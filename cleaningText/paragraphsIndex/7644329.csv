"Camilleri moved from his early influences by Maltese folk music to a musical form ""in which nothing is fixed and his compositions evolve from themselves with a sense of fluency and inevitability"". He composed over 100 works for orchestra, chamber ensemble, voice and solo instruments. Camilleri's work has been performed throughout the world and his research of folk music and improvisation, the influences of the sounds of Africa and Asia, together with the academic study of European music, helped him create a ""universal"" style.

"Camilleri is recognized in Malta as one of the major composers of his generation. His works include Malta Suite, Maltese Dances, A Maltese Overture - Din l-Art Helwa, operas in Maltese, a ballet based on the Knights of Malta and the oratorio Pawlu ta' Malta.  His piano piece Cantilena, is currently part of the Grade 5 Trinity Guildhall piano syllabus. The Missa Mundi for solo organ was described by its first publisher as ""the organ's Rite of Spring"". Noospheres (1977) was premiered at Canada House in London on 12 May 1979 by Kyla Greenbaum (Crowcroft) and subsequently recorded by her.
