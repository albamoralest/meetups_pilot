"Russell's song parodies use melodies from old standards with new humorous lyrics pertinent to the subject matter. For example, in 1990, following the execution of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, Russell did a parody song on his show to the tune of ""Chattanooga Choo-Choo"". (""Pardon me, boys / Are you the cats who shot Ceauşescu?"") Russell himself admits that most of his jokes and songs are very topical and have ""a shelf life shorter than cottage cheese"". Russell's humor is known for skewering Democrats and Republicans as well as third party, independent politicians and other prominent political (and sometimes nonpolitical) figures. Russell has often been asked the question ""Do you have any writers?"" His standard response is ""Oh, yes. I have 535 writers: One hundred in the Senate and 435 in the House of Representatives!"" When asked if his views on current events are too caustic, Russell replies, ""I follow the old newsman's adage. As they say, 'I don't make the news. I just report it.' And in my case, I don't even make the jokes. I just report them as they masquerade as news.""For several years, on the Sunday before Labor Day, Russell made annual appearances on Meet the Press, which was hosted from 1991 to 2008 by Tim Russert, also a Canisius High graduate.

"In 1994, Russell found himself unexpectedly allied with the rap group 2 Live Crew when the group was sued for copyright infringement for their parody of the song ""Oh, Pretty Woman"". The case went to the Supreme Court, where Russell and the members of 2 Live Crew argued that song parodies were protected under fair use. The Supreme Court agreed and ruled in favor of Russell and 2 Live Crew (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.).

"In the NewsRadio episode ""The Public Domain"" (1997), Phil Hartman's character Bill McNeal is inspired by Russell to start a career as a singing political comedian. For his PBS special's earlier years, an electronic version of ""Yankee Doodle"" was used in the opening sequence, which featured animated versions of an eagle, an elephant, and a donkey with Russell, dressed as Uncle Sam, being dragged by its tail marching across the screen. In later years, the opening sequence was a montage of a few of Russell's monologues accompanied by a Dixieland arrangement of Stars and Stripes Forever.  A similar arrangement of the song ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" was used for his entrance and as the closing theme.
