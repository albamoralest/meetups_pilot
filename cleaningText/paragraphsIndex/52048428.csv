"After departing from Unknown Error he started up his solo alias Apex, with the first release, ""Space Between"" (featuring Ayah), released in April 2007 on Hospital Records, immediately hitting the BBC Radio 1 D&B Top Ten. It was included in the Andy C's mix CD D&B Arena Mix and Hospital Records' Weapons of Mass Creation 3. In the same year Apex was part of establishing the label Lifted Music with Chris Renegade, Spor, Evol Intent, and Ewun. In the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008 he toured around the world with a series of parties from the label Lifted Music Recordings. In February 2008, he released his solo EP Wall of Sound on Lifted Music which was extremely well received. In 2008 he won the Beatport D&B track of the year with his remix of Bachelors of Science's ""Strings Track"". In June 2009 his remix of ""Just One Second"" from London Elektricity's Syncopated City album was released to great acclaim and was also featured on the Hospitality Drum & Bass 2010 compilation by Hospital Records. This track was very well received and even a few years after its release, in 2016, it was chosen by record breaking explorer Ben Saunders on the BBC radio show Desert Island Discs as one of his favourite tracks to listen to on his expeditions. This track was also used to promote and feature on the soundtrack of Gran Turismo 5.
