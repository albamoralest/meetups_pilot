"A native of Rio de Janeiro, José Rodrigues Trindade used a modified spelling of his middle name as part of his stage name throughout a career that spanned over four decades. Som Imaginario, with another well-known member, Robertinho Silva, accompanied Milton Nascimento and Gal Costa and, in 1971, Elis Regina's recording of his rock-rural ""Casa no Campo"" (with Tavito) became a huge hit. During the 1970s, Sá e Guarabyra would continue as a duo while Rodrix pursued a solo career.  Both acts played what they described as ""rural rock"", ""a synthesis of the escapist dream depicted in the American folk-rock songs of the '60s within the reality of upcountry Brazil"". A longtime resident of São Paulo, Zé Rodrix died of natural causes  at the age of 61.
