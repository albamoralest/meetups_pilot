"Hall was a founding director of the production company Motion Theory, which he helped build from a pure animation and design company into an award-winning live-action and visual effects studio. The company’s unique hybrid model and creative results later caught the eye of filmmakers Guillermo del Toro and Guillermo Navarro, who co-founded Mirada as Motion Theory’s feature-film visual effects arm, with Hall taking a creative leadership role in the new company and simultaneously continuing to write and direct projects. In 2010, Hall returned to TV, serving as a consulting producer and director for the debut season of Sam Raimi's Spartacus: Blood and Sand starring Lucy Lawless and Andy Whitfield.

That same year, he also co-directed Katy Perry’s “Roar,” the most-watched video of the year and People’s Choice Award winner. Hall left Motion Theory and Mirada in 2014 to join Partizan Entertainment, home to directors such as Michel Gondry, Antoine Bardou-Jacquet, and Michael Gracey. There, he worked on high-profile campaigns for companies such as Amazon, Pepsi, and Microsoft – directing the global launch video for the HoloLens augmented-reality viewer. By 2016, Hall transitioned into the role of independent director, taking on a wider variety of creative projects through different production companies, agencies, and direct clients such as Intel, Honda, and Netflix.
