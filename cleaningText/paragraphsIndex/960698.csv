"Carlisle is best known for his hit song ""Butterfly Kisses"", which appeared on his third solo album. That album, originally titled Shades of Grace, was later re-released as Butterfly Kisses (Shades of Grace), because of the success of the single. He co-wrote this song with his songwriting partner from Allies, Randy Thomas, and for this, they won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Country Song and three Dove Awards, including Song of the Year. This song was also a country chart single that same year for Jeff Carson and the Raybon Brothers. After ""Butterfly Kisses,"" Carlisle continued to record for movie soundtracks and with other artists, but could not match the success of his surprise hit.
