"Sloan Wainwright is the daughter of Loudon Wainwright Jr. and Martha Taylor. She is a younger sister to Loudon Wainwright III, and aunt to Canadian-American musicians Martha Wainwright and Rufus Wainwright and American musician Lucy Wainwright Roche. She was married to George McTavey, who died in December 2008 after a long illness. They had two sons, Sam and Gabe McTavey. As a performer, Wainwright is known for her rich contralto voice and personal lyrics. Her musical style combines pop, folk, jazz, and blues. Born into a highly acclaimed musical family, her teenage years were largely influenced by a constant flow of diverse artists, writers and musicians. Writing and performing throughout the Greenwich Village scene, she developed her songwriting style. In the mid 1990s, Sloan began to collaborate with guitarist Stephen Murphy. They assembled a band and Sloan released a self-titled debut CD in 1996, 'Sloan Wainwright'. The Sloan Wainwright Band followed with a second release in 1998, a tribute in memory of her mother Martha, entitled 'From Where You Are.' The third band releaseâ€”in early 2001,The Song Inside, merges traditionally based folk music and more eccentric variations. After that, she released Cool Morning, featuring her rendition of U2's ""Where The Streets Have No Name"".
