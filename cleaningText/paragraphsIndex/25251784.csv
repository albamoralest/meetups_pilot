"Frank Valdor (27 May 1937 – 5 August 2013) was one of the great German bandleaders having sold over 2.5 million records during the 1960s and 1970s. In particular, Valdor was popular for his instrumental arrangements intended to be played non-stop at parties. He has been called ""King of Dynamic Party Sound"". His discography consists of more than 80 LP's, 10 singles and 8 CD's. Valdor's record covers often have a ""genius"" graphical touch, where he is shown surrounded by scantily dressed women. His album King Size sold 25,000 copies in Finland and was awarded gold status. Like James Last did Frank Valdor had also a period during the earlier 1970s, when he was a celebrated musician in Scandinavia. Mainly, but not exclusively, for those who at the time were older than 30 years old.
