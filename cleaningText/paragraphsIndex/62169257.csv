"The band has been championed by Jack White - who took them out on arena shows around the US, and Rolling Stone compared Brown’s “gorgeously yearning, full-voiced alto range” to Nico while NPR raved, “There's something delightfully unique about Mattiel's music. A pinch of garage rock, a touch of psychedelia, some galloping honky-tonk and at the lead, Mattiel Brown's powerful and assertive vocals.”Sophomore album Satis Factory received four-star reviews from The Guardian, Q, Mojo, DIY, Uncut, The Times, and was named Album of Weekend by BBC Radio 1 Hype Chart and A-listed as Album of the Day on BBC Radio 6 Music. Mattiel were also listed as WXPN Artist of the Month. In addition, Mattiel have also performed on Later... with Jools Holland and Last Call with Carson Daly and featured in BBC Prom in Royal Albert Hall, London.
