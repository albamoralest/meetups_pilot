His theatrical career took off, and he appeared in music hall and the West End. One of his most successful performances was in Tonight's the Night at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1914–15.

"It was his second wife, songwriter Mabel Anderson, 26 years younger than he was, who became his most important collaborator. In 1922, Penrose made the first recording of his song ""The Laughing Policeman"" under the pseudonym 'Charles Jolly'. The composition of the song is officially credited to his wife Mabel under the pseudonym 'Billie Grey', but the music, melody, and laughing are taken from ""The Laughing Song"" by the American George W. Johnson which was recorded in 1898, 1901 and 1902. The Penroses wrote numerous other laughing songs including ""The Laughing Major"", ""Curate"", ""Steeplechaser"", ""Typist"", ""Lover"" and ""Sneezing Man"". The B-side of The Laughing Sneezing Man was a short comical sketch called ""The Dog Vs The Cornet"" where a little boy had to get his dog to out-sing a cornet player and make him stop playing.
