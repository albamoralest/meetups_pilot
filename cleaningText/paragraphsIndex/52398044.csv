"Pollard started DJing at the age of 15, and started HXV in 2009. In 2012 HXV released his first mixtape, We Off That, on Mad Decent, which was hosted by both Lil' Jon and Cobra Corps. This release piqued the interest of both hip hop heads and dubstep bangers. HXV went on to remix songs by numerous artists, including The Weeknd, Young Jeezy and Charli XCX. In February 2012 HXV, alongside Diplo and Mayhem, produced a mixtape for ATL rap group FKI titled Transformers in the Hood. In January 2014, both Daniel Disaster and Pete H of HXV released their Chapel EP. This was a collaboration with the fashion brand FRESH.i. AM and Red Bull. On April 14, 2015 they introduced fans to Vultures, a five-track EP featuring artists including Lil Uzi Vert, Rome Fortune, Ricky Remedy and Debroka. October 2016 brought light to HXV's emotional single ""Novocaine"" featuring Daniel Disaster's long time and close friend Naz Tokio. ""Novocaine"" centers around Daniel's sobriety and the challenges that come with it, Naz being representative of the disease that is addiction. On November 25, 2016, HXV released Volume 1 of his newly announced Black Friday Mix. The mix features various trap artists, including Eptic, Ekali, Mayhem and KRNE.
