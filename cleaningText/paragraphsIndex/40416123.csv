"Hailing from Compton, Sounwave credits ""Up Jumps da Boogie"" by Timbaland as the first hip hop instrumental he ever listened to. From the age of ten, he started using a Korg drum machine to make simple drum beats. From there, he graduated to a 4-track machine and then to the MTV Music Generator for PlayStation. After using that for a while, he hooked up with rapper Bishop Lamont from Carson, California, and a song he produced for him with MTV Music Generator received local radio placement.

"In 2005, Sounwave was originally discovered by Top Dawg Entertainment co-founder Terrence ""Punch"" Henderson, who had him meet with TDE CEO Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith. Anthony ""Top Dawg"" Tiffith was originally unimpressed with Sounwave; however, Sounwave persisted and honed his craft, which ended up ""blowing away"" Tiffith. It was then he became a member of Digi+Phonics, an American hip hop production team, composed of fellow California-based record producers Tae Beast, Dave Free and Willie B. They served as the main in-house producers for Carson-based record label, Top Dawg Entertainment. Digi+Phonics worked significantly on projects from all the members of hip hop supergroup Black Hippy, who are also signed to Top Dawg and is composed of rappers Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul.
