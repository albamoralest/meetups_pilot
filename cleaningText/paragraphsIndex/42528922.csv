"Evans appeared on the second season of NBC's The Voice. In the blind audition broadcast on February 20, 2012, he sang ""What's Going On"" from Marvin Gaye. Only Christina Aguilera turned her chair during the blind audition, with the other three (Adam Levine, CeeLo Green and Blake Shelton) abstaining. On Team Aguilera as a default, he was put in the Battles round against another Aguilera contestant, Jesse Campbell. On an episode broadcast on March 5, they both sang the Alicia Keys song ""If I Ain't Got You"", with Aguilera opting to keep Campbell after an epic musical confrontation. The show hadn't installed the ""steal option"" for other judges yet, so Evans was eliminated from the show.
