"Sunny Lax debuted on the music scene with the 12"" P.U.M.A. / Cassiopeia EP as his debut release on Anjunabeats in February 2006, which was widely played by highly esteemed DJs such as Paul van Dyk and Armin van Buuren. Music and programming had been a major part of Levente's early life, and at the age of 13 he started producing music of his own without any prior music theory knowledge. After buying a few programming books from his pocketbook, he learnt about music software, notably the ""Modeplug Tracker"", and started to program his own music. He began to compete in various remix competitions in his native Hungary, performing well and boosting his self-esteem. This encouraged Levente to send one of his productions, P.U.M.A., to several music labels, where Anjunabeats agreed to sign it. Sunny Lax's third single, ""M.I.R.A."", was released on Anjunabeats on October 9, 2006. This was followed up with by ""Blue Bird"" on May 21, 2007. In 2013, Sunny Lax launched his own record label ""Sounds of Elysium"" as a sublabel of Blue Soho Recordings, which would mainly feature progressive trance tracks. He released his single ""Marvel"" as the first track on the label.
