"Rock began his music career in Langford, British Columbia (a suburb of Victoria), as a guitarist playing with friends William Alexander and Paul Hyde in the former's household basement. After high school graduation, Rock left Victoria and became the co-founder of the Payolas, who became well known with the success of their 1980s hit, ""Eyes of a Stranger"", which was used as part of the soundtrack of the movie Valley Girl starring Nicolas Cage.
",2,== Payolas and Rock and Hyde ==
"In 1983, the Payolas won the Juno Award for Single of the Year. Rock also worked as an assistant engineer at Little Mountain Sound in Vancouver. In 1987, the band (who had by then changed their name to Paul Hyde and the Payolas) again changed their name to Rock and Hyde and had two hit singles in Canada with the song ""Dirty Water"" (#20), which also charted on Billboard's Hot 100, and ""I Will (#40). In 2007, the Payolas became briefly active once more as a touring and recording act, releasing the EP Langford Part One.
