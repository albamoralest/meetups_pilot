"In 2000, Kawabata wrote ""Music, for me, is neither something that I create, nor a form of self-expression. All kinds of sounds exist everywhere around us, and my performances solely consist of picking up these sounds, like a radio tuner, and playing them so that people can hear them.""""When I was a kid, I really loved Ritchie Blackmore – not so much the guitar style, just I liked his look, atmosphere, on the stage. Always, he stood on this side [right], also the stratocaster, and black clothes, and very aggressive [playing]. I really loved this image, so I wear just black. Also – easy to co-ordinate!""
