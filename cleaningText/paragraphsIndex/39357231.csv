He majored in film and communications at USC where he later attended. In the late 1950s, he was known as Tony Hilder and performed A&R work for Modern Records. In the early 1960s Hilder became a prolific producer of Surf Music. According to Who Put the Bomp magazine, Hilder's name as publisher, producer etc., appears on many records, both 45s and albums. His name would have appeared on more if it wasn't for the poor crediting on the budget releases. As a producer, he produced records such as Jim Waller's ""Surfin' Wild"".

Hilder believed Ronald Reagan was a tool for the bankers by the mid-1970s; previously he had supported him. He also had further issues with Reagan. In the mid-1990s, Hilder hosted the Radio Free World radio show in Los Angeles. Also in that period, he was hosting his syndicated television show, Millennium 2000.

"Hilder had a prolific output as a producer in the surf genre. He's mentioned and referenced in books such as Surfin' Guitars: Instrumental Surf Bands of the Sixties by Robert J. Dalley, and various other surf music related publications. He is also credited with bringing the surf sound to a host of independent California record labels in the early 1960s. According to Who Put the Bomp magazine, Hilder was responsible for more local surf music being recorded and released than any other individual. Years later his status as a producer in the surf genre was acknowledged in a 1995 issue of CD Review. Records released on other labels such as Del-Fi Records and Challenge Records credit Hilder as either orchestra leader, publisher, or writer. He had also used the pseudonym of Mark Hilder.

"In the late 1950s, Hilder worked for the Kent and Modern record labels. His time at Modern Records gave him contacts he could use in the music business.  In 1959 having left the Kent / Modern organisation, Hilder would form CT Records, which would be his first record label. Two singles were subsequently released on CT. In time to come he would take advantage of the surf music craze. Hilder would become involved with Billy Watkins, Jesse Belvin and Charles Wright. With the assistance of Hilder, Wright penned ""You're Unforgettable"" for Billy Watkins. Released in 1959 on the Challenge label, it was backed with a Robert Hafner composition, ""Rendezvous"". It was given a B+ rating by The Cash Box in its October 17 issue. It was also a prediction  that month by Billboard to do well, and became a local hit year. Hilder was also involved in the release of Rickey Agary's rocker single, ""Everybody Needs Someone"".  Agary was backed by the Mark Anthony Band. The two part single was released on the Bel Canto label in 1959.

"The RevelsIn 1960, his Impact label had its first release. The record was ""Church Key"" by the Revels, released on Impact 1.  Hilder's association with the Revels began in early in 1960. One day, the Revels were at a Chevrolet dealership in San Luis Obispo, playing for a March of Dimes benefit. Hilder had come into town to promote two artists of his, Billy Watkins and Charles Wright. He was looking for a band to back them while on tour. Norman Knowles wanted him to think about using the Revels as the backing band. Not that impressed, Hilder didn't consider them. However he left his business card. The second time Hilder came into contact with the group was in the summer of 1960. The group had driven down to LA to record at a small studio located on the corner of Santa Monica and Western for what was their second recording session. The session wasn't going coming along that well so Knowles decided to ring Hilder to come over, and with his experience help them out. Soon Hilder arrived with his partner and songwriter, Robert Hafner. Hilder's attention was focused on guitarist Dan Darnold's playing around with the vibrato bar of his guitar. Hafner helped with a melody centering around the vibrato's hook. An arrangement was put together and later the title ""Church Key"" was given to the musical piece. Barbara Adkins who was Hilder's girlfriend (and later his wife) provided the giggles on the recording. Hafner brought some other tunes with him, one of which was ""Vesuvius"". The band learned it there in the studio and recorded it. Not having a label of his own at the time, Hilder and Norman Knowles started their own company as partners, splitting the costs as well as the profits. In 1960, the group released ""Vesuvius"" bw ""Church Key"" on Tony Hilder's CT label. Then it was later released on Impact, this time with ""Church Key"" as the A side.

"Other acts and recording venturesIn 1962, Hilder attended a practice session by Rendezvous Ballroom regulars, the Rhythm Rockers, and heard them doing their version of a song he held the rights to, ""Church Key"". They would have two singles released on Impact, ""Moment Of Truth"" bw ""Frogwalk and ""Church Key"" bw ""Passion"". In late 1962, he reached out to a group called the Latin Knights in a bid to get them recorded. He did several sessions with them in the studios in L.A. He later changed their name to the Charades and signed them to his label. Two songs were released on Impact, ""Sophia"" and ""Christina"". In 1963, he produced the album The Winners Of The 18 Band Surf Battle, which was released on the GNP Crescendo label. It included titles by the Rhythm Kings and Dave Myers & the Surftones. In 1966, represented by attorney Al Schlesinger, Hilders company Anthony Music was involved in legal action with Del-Fi records, filing a $122,000 Superior Suit over breach of contract, fraud and money owned. This was over royalties not being paid as per an alleged agreement for the masters of various albums. This included recordings by the Centurians, Dave Myers and the Surftones, the Sentinels and an LP  Battle of the Surf Bands.  Also in the same year, Hilder approached Myron Fagan a playwright-director for information. He urged Fagan who was nearly 80 to pass on his knowledge of the CFR, Illuminati and its new world order plans so it could be preserved. In 1967, the result was an album called The Illuminati CFR. According to the book by Mark Jacobson, Pale Horse Rider: William Cooper, the Rise of Conspiracy, and the Fall of Trust in America, it was recorded at a studio where Hilder normally recorded the surf-rock groups. It was released as a 3 record set  that Hilder produced.

"During the 1960s, Hilder oversaw Impact Records, a Los Angeles-based record label. One of the functions of Impact Records was to be an outlet for masters that Hilder couldn't release on other labels. Much of the material released by the label was from local aspiring artists and bands. It was announced in the May 8, 1961, issue of Billboard that Hilder had put Dean Zook in a position to head the label's Midwest Radio-TV promotion. From his base in Denver, Zook's first efforts were concentrated on the promotion of the Revels' single which had been featured in the 1961 film, The Exiles.

"The Revels, a local Californian band had been around since 1957. They had 4 singles released on the label from 1960 to 1962 which included the single they were best known for, their 1960 hit ""Church Key"". The single was distributed nationally by Liberty Records but was issued under the banner of Impact to keep the identity of the label. Another artist that had a release on the label was Latino singer, Little Ray Jimenez in 1962 with ""Shake! Shout! & Soul!"" bw ""Soul & Stomp"". Other artists included Shorty Bacon, and the Charades. Another artist to have a release on the label in 1962 was Rue Barclay who had been recording since the late 1940s. The following year Barclay appeared in a low budget film, The Skydivers.  One album that Hilder produced for his Impact label was Shake! Shout! & Soul, which was recorded live at Santa Monica's 2nd Annual Surf Fair. It featured Lil Ray, The Original Surfaris, Dave Myers and the Surftones, the New Dimensions, Steve Korey and the Virtue Four. Robert Hafner also worked on compositions with Hilder and for artists on Impact.

These were the tapes that Hilder had produced ten years earlier. After catching up about old times, Hilder offered an opportunity for the group to do a musical score for a film, Black Lolita. From that they recorded the love theme for the film.

In  July 1988, there was a movement taking place within the National Rifle Association by some of its members to oust President George H. W. Bush from the association. Bush was a lifetime member and according to the article that ran in the Chicago Tribune, he had no intention of leaving the association. Hilder, who led the petition drive in Alaska, said that petition drives were underway in 23 states. Hilder was at a weekend gun show collecting 400 signatures according to St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Hilder claimed that just one NRA member could call the expulsion of another if he alleged there was a violation of NRA bylaws. One such bylaw was that members protect and defend the Constitution. Hilder also went into the committee's process and how it would handle the alleged offence. In June 1993, Hilder was kicked out of the studio at KLAV for his remarks about Janet Reno's alleged relationship to Cult Awareness Network (CAN) which had a role in the whistleblowing of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas.  He remarked that President Bill Clinton was the ""velvet"" on the iron fist of Commu-Fascism and he should be impeached.

"Hilder documentariesIn 1993, Hilder teamed up with Jordan Maxwell for the first time in Lucifer 2000. The film was about the American Illuminati's plan for global domination. Similarly, another documentary of Hilder's that was released in the 1990s was Millennium 2000. Featuring Ray Yungen, Terry L Cook and Jordan Maxwell, it was about the ""One Party System"", and looked at the supposed plan for World domination via the boardrooms of the Major Banking  institutions. It also looked at the related symbiology. In 1995, Reichstag 95: An American Holocaust was released. It featured Ted Gunderson. In 2001, Hilder released Illuminazi 911 which featured Jordan Maxwell, Ted Gunderson and Clayton Douglas. Released in 2001, and possibly the earliest of the 911 conspiracy type of films, the 86 minute documentary was asking who was really behind the attack on the World Trade Center. In 2003, Panic Project was out. Hilder is joined by Norio Hayakawa and Jordan Maxwell. They look at Area 51 and what may be going on there. His other documentary Area 51 was of a similar theme. In 2004, 911: The Greatest Lie Ever Sold was released. Running at just over two hours, it features news clips of the 9/11 tragedy and commentary by Hilder. In the film, Hilder attempts to present a Nazi world domination type of theory as for what may be behind the 9/11 attacks.  In 2007, Skull & Bones: The Catholic Connection was released. It featured William David Cox, a former seminarian who had a 30-year history at uncovering attacks on the Catholic faith. The film presented a theory that a NeoCon Nazi cabal was behind the control of the US currency and commerce as well as Christianity.
