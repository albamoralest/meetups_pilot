"Holland's eponymous debut studio album, produced by the Doobie Brothers' former lead singer Michael McDonald, was released in 1980 and featured the hit ""How Do I Survive"", which peaked at No. 22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Her second studio album titled On Your Every Word followed in 1983, featuring the single ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing"" a duet with Chris Christian, which peaked at No. 88 on the Billboard Hot 100, and it also peaked at No. 21 on the Adult Contemporary chart. That same year she contributed two songs to the soundtrack to the film Scarface. One of the songs Holland recorded for Scarface, ""She's on Fire"", was also featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto III. Holland went on to sing backing vocals on McDonald's albums, in addition to singing backing vocals on albums by other artists and bands such as First Call. In 2008, Holland released her third studio album, The Journey to Miracle River, on Chonin Records. Produced by her long-time friend Bernie Chiaravalle (singer/guitarist for McDonald since 1988), the album was recorded in Nashville over an 8-year period. Holland co-wrote 10 of the 12 songs with Chiaravalle along with other writers John Goodwin, Jon Vezner, and McDonald. Other songs were also penned by Robben Ford and Chazz Frichtel. This album marked Holland's return to the music industry after several years of hiatus to raise a family and deal with health issues. In 2016, she released her fourth studio album, Light On My Path. The album features  a duet, ""Prove That by Me"" with Michael McDonald, in addition to background vocals by David Pack (Ambrosia), Joseph Williams (musician) (Toto), and David Crosby.
