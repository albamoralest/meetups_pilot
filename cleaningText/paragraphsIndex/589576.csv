"Abeyta was given his nickname by NOFX founder Fat Mike because at the time he joined the band in 1991, Fat Mike was dating a girl named Erin and he didn't want there to be any confusion. Singer Fat Mike suggested the name El Hefe and his first recording with NOFX was his contribution to their EP The Longest Line. He once owned a nightclub called ""Hefe's"" in Eureka, California, and now lives in Stevenson Ranch, California. He has two children and is divorced from Jennifer Abeyta.
