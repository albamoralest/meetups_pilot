"The Supremes, whilst being the first to record ""Come See About Me"", were not the first to issue it as a single. That distinction fell to Dodds, and her version started selling, climbing to #74 on the Billboard Hot 100, but Motown quickly released the Supremes' version as a single, which killed sales of Dodds's version.
