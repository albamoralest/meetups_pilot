At the age of eighteen he joined the band of Perez Prado, and in 1965 he moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico.

While in New York City, Acuña recorded several songs under RCA records. Acuña decided to leave because of the genre limitations placed on him, in which RCA records only had him play Latin music.
