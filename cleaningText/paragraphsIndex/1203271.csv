"Wong was born Wong Jum-sum (Chinese: 黃湛森; Jyutping: wong4 zaam3 sam1; Cantonese Yale: wòhng jaam sām) in Panyu, in what now is part of Guangzhou, China. He migrated to Hong Kong with his family in 1949. He completed his secondary education at La Salle College.

"Wong participated in a variety of media fields including advertising, movies and music. Nicknamed a ""genius"" (Chinese: 鬼才; Jyutping: gwai2 coi4; Cantonese Yale: gwái chòih; lit. 'ghost talent') for his prodigious abilities, he was best known for his achievements as a lyricist of Cantonese songs in Hong Kong.  Beginning from the 1960s, he was the lyricist for over 2,000 songs, collaborating with composer Joseph Koo (a.k.a. Gu Gaa-fai) on many popular TVB TV drama theme songs, many of which have become classics of the genre. His works pushed the development of Cantopop to unprecedented popularity.
",5,== Career and contributions ==
"While well known and praised for his creative works in the entertainment and advertisement fields, Wong was also famous for his vulgar and indelicate jokes. He had a series of best-selling joke books. He was regarded as responsible for breaking the barrier to many cultural taboos in Hong Kong during the conservative environment in the 1970s. He is best remembered as the person who came up with the slogan ""Two kids are good enough"" for The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong.
",6,== Career and contributions ==
"Wong hosted several TV programs, mostly interviews or talk shows oriented towards adults, on both TVB and ATV. One of the talk shows called ""Off-guard Tonight"" (今夜不設防), co-hosted by Wong and his close friends Chua Lam and Ni Kuang on ATV, is particularly remembered.
",7,== Career and contributions ==
"As a singer, he is a tenor with 2.5 octaves in chest voice due to him being a heavy smoker.
",8,== Career and contributions ==
"In the 1990s, Wong's creative works became less popular, and many entertainment companies featured fewer of Wong's songs. Some TV shows hosted by Wong were also unpopular. Wong decided to return to Hong Kong University to get a doctorate degree in Hong Kong popular culture. His dissertation essay is now in the library of Hong Kong University.
",9,== Career and contributions ==
"On 24 November 2004, Wong died at the Union Hospital in Hong Kong. His funeral was a low-key family funeral as per his wishes. Hong Kong citizens reflected on his career and accomplishments during this time. In the following days, the news of his death became the primary media headline in Hong Kong, and his compositions were played throughout the week. A remembrance ceremony took place at Hong Kong Stadium, with over 15,000 attending this ceremony.

"Wong was officially married twice, but had three notable relationships. He had three children with his first wife, singer Wah Wa. Their sons were Wong Yue-hon (黃宇瀚) and Wong Yue-man (黃宇文). Their marriage ended while Hua Wa was pregnant with their only daughter, Ursule Wong (黃宇詩). 
",12,== Personal life ==
"Wong once said the most important love of his life was Eunice Lam, a writer whom he lived with from 1976 to 1990, but did not marry. Lam was also a radio host, and was the sister of Richard Lam, a Cantopop lyricist. Lam died from cancer in 2018. Wong's second marriage was to his long-time assistant, Winnie Chan, until his death, but she was never seen with him in public.
