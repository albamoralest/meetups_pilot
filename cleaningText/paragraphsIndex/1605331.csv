"Henderson formed Tribal Tech with bass player Gary Willis in 1984. Under the direction of Henderson and Willis, Tribal Tech became one of the most highly regarded fusion bands of the 1980s.  During the band's initial run until their dissolution following the 2000 album Rocket Science, Henderson brought himself to the forefront of modern jazz/fusion guitar playing. In 1991 he was named '#1 Jazz Guitarist' by Guitar World magazine, and in January 1992 he was voted best jazz guitarist in Guitar Player magazine's Annual Reader's Poll. Tribal Tech reunited and released an album entitled X in 2011, but in June 2014, Henderson posted on his message board that the band would again be dissolving.
