"Doyle took piano and cello lessons from as young as 5 or 6 years old. He lost interest in these instruments as he began studying at university, when he began teaching himself other instruments, such as the guitar, drums, and bass guitar, and learned how to create music with computers. Doyle later won a place at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge to read English alongside future Hot Chip bandmate Felix Martin.

"Doyle joined British indie electronic band Hot Chip in 2003 before the recording session for their debut studio album, Coming on Strong (2004).

"Soon after the release of their self-titled debut studio album, Doyle joined American rock band LCD Soundsystem as a live member, as noted in the liner notes of their second studio album, Sound of Silver (2007). He would go on to play the Yamaha CS-60 and guitar on their 2010 song ""You Wanted a Hit"", the sixth track from their third studio album, This Is Happening (2010). In 2011, band frontman James Murphy announced that they were disbanding and would perform a farewell show at Madison Square Garden, where Doyle also played. The band would reunite, however, in 2015, to release a new album. Doyle became a much more prominent studio member of the band during the recording sessions, receiving writing credits on seven tracks out of the album's ten, and performing several instruments, including piano, cello, bowed mandolin, and electronic drums. The album, titled American Dream, was released on 1 September 2017.
