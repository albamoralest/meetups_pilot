"A self proclaimed ‘Street Dancer’ by the time he was 16, Redd had become a regular on Soul Train, one of the most Popular American music-dance television shows in history. Redd and his partner, Cheryl Song, were two of the show's most popular dancers. Because of this popularity, they were invited to compete in the American Bandstand dance contest. Since the two programs rarely co-mingled dancers, this was a singular honor.
