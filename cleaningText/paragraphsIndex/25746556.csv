"Oregon born, alternative pop artist Reni Lane (previously spelled Reni Laine) was featured as a concert and jazz pianist as well as trombonist in the Lafayette High School ""Ram"" band in Williamsburg, Virginia before moving to New York City when she was 18 to attend Columbia University.  She began to perform weekly at The Sidewalk Cafe (where Suzanne Vega and Regina Spektor were discovered), and worked with songwriters such as David Poe and Joseph Arthur. When Reni finished her first album, American Baby, she toured Europe with her band. In 2009 she briefly toured as a member of The Like with the popular indie rock band Arctic Monkeys.  MTV featured her in their 'First Ladies of Rock' ad campaign sponsored by Virgin Mobile and this brought her to the attention of songwriter/producer Sam Bisbee. Their work was handed over to super producer Linda Perry who signed her, resulting in her Custard Records/ Motown Universal debut, Ready. Reni performed at Michele Clark 's Sunset Sessions 2010 where she played songs from her new album Ready in front of Music Supervisors, record companies, artist managers, and radio stations.
