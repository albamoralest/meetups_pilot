"Lenoci studied with pianists Paul Bley and Mal Waldron. A reviewer of his 1995 album Existence commented on Lenoci's ""fascination with Paul Bley's scalar investigation – he rides his way through to the center of the melody in each case to find the improvising scale, and when he does, he creates arpeggios and skittering skeins of notes to cover it up while opening another door"". Lenoci died on 30 September 2019.
