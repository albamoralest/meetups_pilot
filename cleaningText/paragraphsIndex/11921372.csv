"A native of Philadelphia, Butler began his career in the 1940s behind the Harlemaires. In the 1950s he was a member of a trio led by Doc Bagby and accompanied keyboardist Bill Doggett. He wrote ""Honky Tonk"", an R&B hit for Doggett. Butler also worked with Al Casey, King Curtis,  Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis, Bill Davison, Tommy Flanagan, Panama Francis, Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Goodman, Johnny Hodges, Floyd ""Candy"" Johnson, David ""Fathead"" Newman, Houston Person, Sammy Price, Jimmy Smith, Norris Turney, and Dinah Washington. He is credited as the guitarist on Joey Dee and the Starliters' ""Peppermint Twist, Parts 1 & 2"" recorded in September 1961 at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City. Part 1 of the song went to the top of the Billboard pop charts in January 1962. Butler died of a heart attack at home in Teaneck, New Jersey, in 1991.
