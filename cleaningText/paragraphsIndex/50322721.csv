"Swirsky was born in the United States before his family moved to Mevo Modi'im, Israel when he was ten. The village's founder, influential Jewish singer Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, would frequently visit the village and perform for the residents. Swirsky first played professionally when he was 15 as part of Carlebach's band at a Tel Aviv concert.

"Growing up in Mevo Modi'in, Swirsky became close friends with his neighbor Yehuda Solomon, whose father, Ben Zion Solomon, was a founding member of Diaspora Yeshiva Band and one of the first residents of the village. Swirsky and Solomon performed together from a young age and formed the Moshav Band in 1996. They have released ten albums since 1998 and have been credited, alongside Blue Fringe and Soulfarm, with pioneering a new movement of Jewish rock in the 1990s.
