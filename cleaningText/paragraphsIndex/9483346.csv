"When Seattle grunge pioneers the Melvins temporarily disbanded in late 1987, bassist Matt Lukin left the band to form Mudhoney. The Melvins replaced him with Lori Black. At the time, Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne was dating Black, and the idea developed to have her play bass for the band. The first recording to feature Black's work was 1989's Ozma. Black is also credited with playing on the band's major label debut Houdini in 1993, though Osborne has said Black did not play on it.
