"In April 2011, Cassettes Won't Listen announced the release date of his latest album, KEVINSPACEY, on Daylight Curfew, his recently founded artist collective / record label.  On May 12 he was served with a cease and desist from actor Kevin Spacey and his legal team forcing him to change the name of his upcoming record. The ""K"" was dropped effectively renaming the record to EVINSPACEY.  The record was released on June 21, 2011 via Daylight Curfew. A new EP, Casa, was released via Daylight Curfew on August 14, 2012. Cassettes Won't Listen issued an essay detailing the process and inspiration behind the release and effectively put the CWL project on hiatus (possibly indefinite) in order to focus on his new project, Dfalt, and record label, Daylight Curfew.
