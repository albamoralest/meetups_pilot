"Cazzu started her musical career as a cumbia singer and then as a rock singer, in which she was not very successful. After kicking off her music career in cumbia and rock, she tested the waters in the urban scene, dropping real unapologetic songs about female empowerment. She started her musical career as Cazzu as an independent artist, paying for her first recordings and video clips. In an interview with Billboard Argentina, she said: ""For me, Cazzu is everything I want to be. She's my alter ego, she's a damn superhero.""She gained popularity in the Latin trap music scene after the release of her collaboration ""Loca"" with fellow Argentine trap singers Khea and Duki. The song became even more popular after Bad Bunny joined for the remix.
