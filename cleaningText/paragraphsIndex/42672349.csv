"Kyriakou auditioned for The Voice of Greece at the age of twenty-nine. Appearing on the third of the eight blind auditions, she auditioned with ""Because of You"" originally by Kelly Clarkson—with all four coaches electing for her to join their teams; from which Kyriakou selected Despina Vandi. During the battles, she performed ""Hero"" against Eva Kanata–with Despina crowning her as the winner. In the second live show, she performed ""I Have Nothing"" and was saved by the public. In the third live show, she performed ""Den Eisai Edo"" and was once again saved by the public along with Stelios Mayalios. In the fourth live show, she performed ""Hurt"" and was saved by the public to proceed to the semi-final. In the semi-final, she performed ""Bleeding Love"" for her solo performance and ""Listen"" for her duet with Mando. Kyriakou proceeded to the final after getting 60 points from her coach and 80 points from the public. Her song ""Dio Egoismoi"" was available on iTunes the day after the semi-final, on 3 May 2014. In the final she performed her original song ""Dio Egoismoi"" and a duet with her coach with the song ""No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)"".
