"Acland was a keen football fan and a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. He and members of Moose and the Cocteau Twins formed the band The Lillies and recorded a humorous flexi-disc entitled ""And David Seaman Will Be Very Disappointed About That"" following the team's victory over North London rivals Arsenal in the 1991 FA Cup semi-finalsOn 17 October 1996, Lush had completed their tour and music festival appearances. Two days after Anderson announced a desire to quit the band, Acland was found dead as a result of suicide by hanging in his parents' garden in Burneside, Cumbria. Devastated by the news, Acland's bandmates subsequently disbanded after a period of mourning.
