"Hunt was born in Dayton, Ohio. His father, Van Hunt, Sr., was a friend of Ohio Players drummer Jimmy ""Diamond"" Williams. Hunt took up the drums at age 7, and saxophone at the age of 8, later adding bass and keyboards. Guitar was the last instrument he learned to play; he played guitar in a rock band called Royalty. Hunt moved to Arlington, Texas for a short time before relocating to Atlanta, Georgia in 1996 to attend Morehouse College, where he studied English, but soon dropped out. In Atlanta, he started producing a few hip-hop demos for Atlanta rappers in order to pay bills. Hunt met up-and-coming record producers and artists like Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri and TLC through his work on demos.

"Hunt released the 4 track digital EP, The Popular Machine, on August 7, 2007. Hunt announced a full-length album, Popular, to be released on Blue Note Records on January 15, 2008. Hunt moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles in 2007 while the album was nearing completion. Blue Note had taken over Hunt's recording contract after corporate restructuring at Blue Note and Capitol's parent company, EMI. In December 2007, Blue Note announced that they would not be releasing the album, and that Hunt and the label mutually agreed to part ways. Hunt wrote on his MySpace blog in January 2008, that he couldn't promise that Popular would ever be officially released. Blue Note owns the master recordings and opted not to sell it back to him at an affordable price. Hunt commented that he ""didn't think that they had enough money"" to promote the album properly. LA Weekly called the album an ""appealingly trippy fusion of funk grooves, punk guitar and soul vocals"", and ""a left-field stunner"". Hunt told the Atlanta alternative weekly newspaper Creative Loafing that he was ""devastated"" when the label decided not to release the album. In August 2017, Popular finally saw an official release on all online distributors 10 years after it was shelved.
