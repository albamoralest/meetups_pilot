"Romero's musical style has been described as always with Latin dance music as a reference, but it is different and unpredictable, ranging from Latin house to urban sounds, such as reggaeton and hip hop.

"At the age of 10, a serious traffic accident forced Romero to spend almost 10 months of immobilisation at home, at which point he discovered the music production of his older brother's group. With him Romero began to experiment, to create his own music in his free time. At the age of 15, as a preferential cadet in the team of Puertos Las Palmas (being champion in Canary Islands and second in Spain), he had to choose between football and music. A year later, he created ""Agáchate"", which was an immediate hit and has generated more than 30 million views on YouTube, swept clubs and sale lists in South America, reaching No. 1 in Venezuela. Since then he is one of the most-requested producers and DJs in Spain by artists, clubs and fans.
