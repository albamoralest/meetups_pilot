"""Baby Cakes"" went straight to number 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and to number 3 on the Irish Singles Chart. It also just crept onto the Eurochart Hot 100 charting at number 91. The song also charted in Belgium, France, Netherlands and Sweden. 3 of a Kind never released a follow-up to ""Baby Cakes"", making them one-hit wonders in the UK. A potential follow-up track, ""Wink One Eye"", was put forward as the second single, but was pulled from the new release listings and never re-scheduled.
