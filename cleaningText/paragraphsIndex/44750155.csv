"21 (2010) (Guitar, Composer)Bennett co-wrote the song ""Old Pair of Jeans"" which was on the Saturday album. According to The Digital Fix, ""It just gets better with every song a winner. The jaunty ‘Old Pair Of Jeans’ is rollicking fun: ""I wish you didn't get hung up so easily / When you're bound fall apart you always fall apart at the seams / So worn and so torn..like an old pair of jeans."" The song also featured on the 21 album. Bennett has toured with Ocean Colour Scene since 2004, but left in February 2015 to focus on his solo material.
