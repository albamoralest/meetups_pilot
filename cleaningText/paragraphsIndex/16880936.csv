"After leaving high school Peck was drafted into the army and became part of Glenn Miller's band. He remained with the band until after World War II ended. He played with Don Redman in 1947. He studied classical music at the Paris Conservatory from 1949 to 1951, while playing and recording with leading jazz musicians such as Coleman Hawkins (1949), James Moody (1949–50), and Roy Eldridge (1950). In the 1950s Peck played on television in New York, and in 1953 he recorded with Dizzy Gillespie. Peck shuttled between Paris and New York until 1957, when he married dancer Vera Tietz and settled in France. In France, Peck played with Michel Legrand, André Hodeir and Duke Ellington. Peck spent some time in England and Germany, working as a staff musician at Sender Freies Berlin and playing with Quincy Jones and the Clarke-Boland Big Band (1963–69). He relocated to London in 1965, where he became active in the studios, film, and television. He played with Benny Goodman in 1970–72 and with Peter Herbolzheimer in 1979. Latterly, Peck worked mainly as a contractor in the entertainment business, which led to him ending his playing career. He died on October 24, 2015.
