"Beau Coup began in the year of 1983 as a recording project and performed under the name Pop Opera. They changed their name to Beau Coup at the end of 1984. The project was started by vocalist Tommy Amato (not to be confused with the prolific session drummer of the same name, also from Cleveland), guitarist Mike McGill and drummer Eric Singer. Eventually, Amato invited keyboardist and songwriter Dennis Lewin to join the project while he was playing in a band called Jonah Koslen and the Heroes. In that same year after the Heroes disbanded, Lewin, Tommy's older brother Frank and Bill March joined the project. With the help from Henry LoConti Sr. and Henry LoConti Jr., proprietors of the Agora Theatre and Ballroom and the ""Agora Record Label"", the band released their 6 song EP titled Beau Coup, known as their (White Album) which featured mostly Lewin's songs. The first single released from that EP was ""Still In My Heart"" which was authorized for airplay by 98.5 WGCL's WNCX  General Manager and Program Directors. The song became a top 10 record on the station. Subsequently Rock 'n Roll Records, a subsidiary of Scotti Brothers Records signed the band and the song was distributed by CBS Records in the year of 1984. Program Director John Gorman (radio) at WMMS also took great interest in Beau Coup and gave them extensive airplay and invited them to participate in many station events as well. After much struggle with Scotti Brothers Records and after being released by the label, the Beau Coup ""Born & Raised on Rock & Roll"" album, CD, and cassette were finally released on the Amherst Record label in the USA and on A&M Records of Canada and Europe in 1987. The song “Sweet Rachel” written by Dennis Lewin, reached #80 on the “Billboard Hot 100” singles chart and received much radio and video play internationally. Other Lewin songs including “Still in my Heart”, “Somewhere Out in the Night” and “Born & Raised on Rock & Roll”  were all picked by Billboard as “Hot Picks”  along with a video which was played on video shows in the US and abroad, including MTV and USA Video Hits. Although Beau Coup disbanded in the early 1990s, from time to time they reunite to perform for several special events.

"Because of the Beau Coup song ""Jane"" which Lewin wrote about the legendary rock music critic Jane Scott, they were invited to perform at her memorial service which was held at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio in 2011. Michael Stanley was also invited to perform but due to events beyond his control he was unable to attend.
