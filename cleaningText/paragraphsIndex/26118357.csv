"Henrik Flyman is best known as a touring and recording musician with Lacrimosa and his own band Evil Masquerade. In the early days of his career Henrik was a founding member of the Swedish fantasy metal band Moahni Moahna where he was active between 1992-1997. A few years later he formed ZooL, which was basically Moahni Moahna with a modified line up and a more classic hard rock sound. ZooL had a brief career and did only release one album. Between 2002-2004 he played lead guitars for the Danish Celtic folk metal band Wuthering Heights and in 2003 he founded Evil Masquerade in Copenhagen. The music on their debut album Welcome to the Show had its roots in both classical music and heavy metal and they were soon labeled by media as being theatrical metal. In 2009 he teams up with Tilo Wolff in the German Dark Wave and Gothic Rock band Lacrimosa on their Sehnsucht World Tour. Henrik is now a touring- and studio musician with the band. In 2009 he also won the Just Plain Folks Music Awards as composer in the category Best Metal Song with Evil Masquerade's Bozo the Clown. Henrik Flyman's latest releases are Lacrimosa's studio album Leidenschaft that was released December 24, 2021  and
