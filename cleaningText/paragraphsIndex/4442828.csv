"Born in Montargis, Petibon's parents were both teachers. She initially studied the visual arts, including painting and subsequently changed her academic focus and earned a bachelor's degree in musicology. She later studied music at the Paris Conservatoire, where her teachers included Rachel Yakar, and from which she graduated with a first prize in 1995. Petibon made her professional stage debut in Paris in 1996 in Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie. She became a member of Les Arts Florissants and worked regularly with William Christie. In various awards under the auspices of Victoires de la musique classique, she was named Best Young Talent in 1998 and as Best Opera Singer in 2001 and 2003. She has made commercial recordings for such labels as Deutsche Grammophon and Erato.
