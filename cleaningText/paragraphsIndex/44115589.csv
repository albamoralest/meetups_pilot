"Panama Wedding is an American synthpop band based in New York City. The four-piece band is fronted by its lead singer and songwriter, Peter Kirk. Originally from Sea Cliff, New York, Kirk grew up recording music in his bedroom, although it wasn't until he rented studio space in Manhattan that he began to seriously write music. Initially, Kirk spent several years performing his electronic and computer-based pop as a solo act before expanding Panama Wedding into a full ensemble with a rhythm section.
