"Chrome Locust was formed by Youth, D Generation drummer Michael Wildwood, and Vásquez bassist Jim Heneghan in 1998. On May 25, 1999 Chrome Locust released a self-titled album on Tee Pee Records.

Youth disbanded Chrome Locust in order to audition for Danzig, despite having a potential offer to tour with The Hellacopters. Youth was also contacted to audition for Foo Fighters during this period. He stated that his decision to audition for Danzig, instead of Foo Fighters, had to do with having more fun on tour and the chance to work with Joey Castillo, who was also from the hardcore punk rock scene, having played with Wasted Youth.
