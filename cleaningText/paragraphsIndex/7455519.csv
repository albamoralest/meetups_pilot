"He received his first drumset when he was 7. When he was nine he started to play the flute at the local music school (Kommunala musikskolan) where he learned how to read sheet music.  After a year of playing the flute he quit and decided to take drum lessons instead.  In 1986 he joined a brass band. He stayed with this band for 8 years. At the age of 14 he created his first rock band named ""Dammer"", which was later changed to ""Zaninez"".  In 1989 Christopher Malmstr√∂m joined the band Zaninez and he and Peter became friends. This friendship would later help to form Darkane.
