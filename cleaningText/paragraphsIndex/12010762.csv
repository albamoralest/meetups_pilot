"Madden was born in Austin, Texas. He began playing in junior high school at the Brentwood School in Los Angeles, playing in garages along with friends Jesse Carmichael (guitar/vocals) and Adam Levine (vocals/guitar). The bands Pearl Jam and Nirvana were among their influences. In 1994, with the addition of Ryan Dusick (drums), the band Kara's Flowers was formed. After the break-up of Kara's Flowers, Madden attended classes at UCLA. After Madden attended college, the group reformed with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up, and Jesse Carmichael mainly playing the keyboards, and pursued a new musical direction, changing their name to Maroon 5. Throughout their career, the band has released six studio albums: Songs About Jane (2002), It Won't Be Soon Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014) and Red Pill Blues (2017).

On June 27, 2020, he was arrested on domestic violence charges. He took a leave of absence from Maroon 5 after his arrest.
