",1,== Life and work ==
"Mertens was born in Neerpelt, Belgium. He studied social and political science at the University of Leuven (graduating in 1975) and musicology at Ghent University; he also studied music theory and piano at the Ghent Conservatory and the Royal Conservatory of Brussels.
",2,== Life and work ==
"In 1978, he became a producer at the then BRT (Belgian Radio and Television, now called Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep). For Radio 2 (Radio Brabant) he produced concerts by Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Meredith Monk, Urban Sax and others, and hosted a program called Funky Town together with Gust De Meyer (with whom he recorded the experimental album For Amusement Only).
",3,== Life and work ==
"Known primarily as a composer since the early 1980s, Mertens began developing a reputation after releasing ""Struggle for Pleasure"", under the name of his early ensemble Soft Verdict, and for ""Maximizing the Audience"", which was composed for Jan Fabre's play The Power of Theatrical Madness, which premiered in 1984 in Venice, Italy.
",4,== Life and work ==
"Mertens' style has continually evolved during the course of his prolific career, starting from downright experimental and avant-garde, always gravitating around minimalism, usually, however, preserving a melodic foundation to the forays that he makes into the worlds that he is exploring. His compositional quality has often overweighted the ""labelling issue"" and reached wider audiences although stemming from a far-from-mainstream musical context (see section In popular culture). One can follow three separate threads of musical styles throughout his work: 
",5,== Life and work ==
"Compositions for ensemble, perhaps his most accessible and ""commercial"" material;
",6,== Life and work ==
"Solo piano and voice compositions, which features haunting keyboard melodies accompanied by Mertens' unique high-pitched tenor voice singing in an invented, personal language; and
",7,== Life and work ==
"Experimental minimalist ""cycles"" for single, dual, and sometimes more instruments. Mertens has released more than 60 albums to date, the majority of which were issued by Les Disques du Crépuscule from 1980 until 2004. Mertens also produced a number of Crépuscule releases and consulted with the label on its choice of works by contemporary composers such as Michael Nyman, Gavin Bryars, and Glenn Branca. Mertens also curated a series of releases for a Crépuscle imprint, Lome Armé, that featured works from the classical era as well as contemporary jazz.
",8,== Life and work ==
"In August 2007 Mertens signed a contract with EMI Classics (now Warner Classics) for his entire catalog. The label re-released his entire back-catalog beginning in January 2008. EMI Music Belgium also released Mertens' new work, beginning with the 9-track album Receptacle on 24 September 2007. For this album Mertens decided to work with an orchestra consisting of only women, 17 in total. It is not the first time that Mertens worked with EMI. Already in 1999, Mertens released the soundtrack to the Paul Cox film Molokai: The Story of Father Damien via EMI Classics.
",9,== Life and work ==
"Mertens is the author of American Minimal Music, which looks at the school of American repetitive music and the work of LaMonte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass.

"With that same title, the collection of electronic music Café del Mar features in its 5th volume ""Close Cover"", one of the most melodic and, in a way, classical pieces of the author.
",12,== In popular culture ==
"""Struggle for Pleasure"" was directly covered by Belgian dance music project Minimalistix in 2000 and reached the Top 40 in the charts in many European countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands. The group also did a successful cover of, again, ""Close Cover"".

"A cover appeared in 2001 on Gatecrasher Digital.  Elastica presents Jesus Elices 'Maximizing the Audience'.
",14,== In popular culture ==
"The James Bond novel High Time to Kill (Raymond Benson, 1999) contains a passing reference to the music of Wim Mertens, in which characters in the novel comment on the music playing in a cafe. Benson, the fourth official James Bond novelist, is a fan of Mertens' music. The reference is somewhat ironic given the interest in James Bond culture shown by Michel Duval, the founder of Les Disques du Crépuscule.
",15,== In popular culture ==
"""Struggle for Pleasure"" also inspired one of the most influential Electronic dance music tracks – Energy 52's trance music project called ""Café Del Mar"", first released on Eye Q Records in 1993. It became a successful hit in 1997 with Three 'n One remix, and Nalin & Kane remixes in 1998. In April 2011, the song was voted number one in Pete Tong's Top 20 Dance Tracks of the last 20 years.
",16,== In popular culture ==
"""Struggle for Pleasure"" is often used in advertisements of Belgian telecommunications provider Proximus.
",17,== In popular culture ==
"His song ""Iris"" was used as the soundtrack for the Swedish Armed Forces’ commercial campaign ""Vi lämnar Sverige ifred"" (”We leave Sweden at peace"") during the autumn-winter of 2017.
