"Ashworth's work came to prominence in the 1980s when he worked with pop bands such as Soft Cell, Eurythmics and The Associates; rock artists such as The Clash, The Ramones, The Cult, Tina Turner, Julian Cope and The The; post-punk band PIL with John Lydon; 1980s-era New Romantic performers Visage and Steve Strange; and established artists such as Bryan Ferry. Ashworth's images have been used on album and single covers of the artists he has photographed, including Adam & The Ants’ Kings of the Wild Frontier, The Associates’ Sulk, Soft Cell's Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome,  Visage's debut album Visage  and Eurythmics' Touch. Unusually for a rock photographer, Ashworth worked mostly with the large, square format Hasselblad cameras because, as he reasoned, ‘album covers are square’.
