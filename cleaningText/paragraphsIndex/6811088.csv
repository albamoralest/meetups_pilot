"Marc Rizzo (born August 2, 1977) is an American musician, best known as the former lead guitarist of metal band Soulfly. He has featured on eight Soulfly albums: Prophecy, Dark Ages, Conquer, Omen, Enslaved, Savages, Archangel, and Ritual. He has also released four solo instrumental albums: Colossal Myopia, The Ultimate Devotion, Legionnaire, and Rotation. Rizzo is also a member of Cavalera Conspiracy, a side project with the co-founders of Sepultura, Max and Igor Cavalera. The band released their debut album Inflikted in 2008, Blunt Force Trauma in 2011 and Pandemonium in 2014. In March 2015, it was announced that Rizzo was playing guitar for Misfits. His only show with the band so far took place at Dutch Comic Con. In June 2016, he joined Dead by Wednesday as a second guitarist. He was known to wear, in the early years, a backpack on stage during the shows. While primarily regarded as a metal guitarist, Rizzo's solo work demonstrates an interest in a wide range of styles, combining elements of hard rock, metal, jazz, classical and flamenco guitar. 2007 saw him headline his first US tour to sell out venues across the country. In 2008, Rizzo's two solo records were released under Shrapnel Records and are available on iTunes (iTunes.com).

"In 2020, Rizzo started his new death metal side project Revenge Beast. In August 2021, Rizzo departed Soulfly after 18 years with the band.  Rizzo said in an interview that he got no support from Soulfly during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Rizzo went further saying “I was doing home renovations, working very hard, 10 hours a day,” he explained. “A Soulfly live record came out [last year, Live Ritual NYC MMXIX]. I never saw a dime of that. So basically, within the [first] six [or] seven months of Covid, I just said, ‘You know, man, I don't want this anymore. I gave you guys 18 years of my life, “And it was a great time. Back in the good years, it was great. But the last eight to 10 years have not been very good"". In October 2021, Marc Rizzo returned to Ill Nino, where he became the original guitarist of the band since 1998 until his departure in 2003.
