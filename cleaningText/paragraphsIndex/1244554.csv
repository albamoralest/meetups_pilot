"Watanabe was born on 1 February 1933 in Utsunomiya, Japan. His father, a professional musician, sang and played the biwa. He was attracted to Jazz from an early age, in part due to the strong cultural influence stemming from the American post-war presence in Japan. Watanabe learned the clarinet while in high school after convincing his father over the course of six weeks to buy him a second-hand instrument. In 1951, Watanabe moved to Tokyo and began playing the alto saxophone. He started studying the flute in 1953 with Ririko Hayashi from the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. He joined Toshiko Akiyoshi’s Cozy Quartet and began leading the group when Akiyoshi moved to the USA. By 1958 he had performed with leading musicians and quartets. In 1961 Watanabe's first album as a leader, the self-titled Sadao Watanabe, was released. In 1962 he left Japan to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Studying led to a broadened stylistic scope that began to incorporate Brazilian music. During his time in the USA, Watanabe worked with Gary McFarland, Chico Hamilton, and Gábor Szabó. Returning to Tokyo, Watanabe became the director of the new Yamaha Institute of Popular Music, a school which based its curriculum on Berklee's. From 1966 onwards, Watanabe toured within Japan and internationally with his own quartet playing bop, Brazilian music, jazz-rock, soul, and pop music. He played with the John Coltrane quintet in Tokyo while the group was touring Japan 1966. By the time he played at the 1970 Newport Jazz Festival he has was a well-known and often highly-regarded jazz performer. Watanabe continued performing and recording through the 1970s and 1980s, amassing a catalogue of more than 70 albums as leader. In addition to his musical career, Sadao Watanabe has published six photography books in Japan. Sadao Watanabe is in charge of visiting professor of Jazz course in Kunitachi College of Music since 2010.
