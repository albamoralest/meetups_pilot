",1,== Life and career ==
"Band was born in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of the film director/producer Albert Band, the brother of director/distributor Charles Band, and the uncle of musician Alex Band. Band has been composing film music for horror and science fiction films regularly. His first notable score was for Laserblast, which he co-composed with Joel Goldsmith.
",2,== Life and career ==
"His score for Stuart Gordon's  Re-Animator was lauded by the magazine Music From the Movies, which said, ""Band’s music is dark and direct, creating an intense and eerie atmosphere, but always with a humorous touch.... Surely, Richard Band is unquestionably one of the most underrated composers in the film business.""He scored several of Gordon's subsequent films such as The Pit and the Pendulum and 1995’s Castle Freak, the later of which featured some inventive writing for a string quartet. He was nominated for an Emmy Award for Gordon's Masters of Horror episode ""Dreams in the Witch House"".
",3,== Life and career ==
"Since 2000, Band has done fewer films, though he has scored many episodes of such television shows as Stargate SG-1, Walker: Texas Ranger. He also developed the campaign music for many shows on the WB, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville.
