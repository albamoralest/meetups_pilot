"Story began her career in 1996 when she met Shane Williams, from the band Silers Bald, at Columbia International University. Williams asked Story to join the band and she became their bass player. Story released four independent albums with the band. When the band was about to sign a deal with Essential Records, Story's manager suggested she record a solo album. In 2002, Story left Silers Bald and began working on her first album, Indescribable, which was released independently that same year. In 2004, the title track of her album was recorded by Chris Tomlin in his album, Arriving. Tomlin's version peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Hot Christian Songs and was included in the compilation album Passion: How Great Is Our God. The band Avalon also recorded a version of the song for the WOW Worship 2006 album. Story released her second independent album in 2005, titled There Is Nothing. The album was produced by Ed Cash and Mitch Dane. During that year, she also married Martin Elvington, and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to become an associate worship leader at Perimeter Church. In 2006, Story signed a record contract with INO Records and two years later, released her third album, Great God Who Saves. The album was also produced by Ed Cash. In 2010, she was nominated for a Dove Award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the 41st GMA Dove Awards. Story released her fourth album, Blessings, in May 2011. Story released her fifth studio album, God of Every Story, on September 30, 2013.

"In May 2011 Story released her fourth album, Blessings. To date, the album has become her biggest commercial success having debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart, giving Story her highest placement ever on the album chart. In June 2011, the first single off the album, also titled ""Blessings"", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Christian Songs chart, giving Story her first number one hit. In an interview, Story explains ""Blessings is just a bunch of songs about worshiping when life is hard"". After her husband Martin Elvington was diagnosed with a brain tumor, she asked ""Why didn't you just fix it, God? You're all powerful and all lovingâ€¦ just fix it."" Later after mentioning her desire to return to a normal life, her sister said ""You know, I think the detour is actually the road."" She realized that ""Spending time with [husband] Martin obviously makes me happy, but it makes me a better person. That's the blessing of it.""After the success of Story's Grammy-winning song, Blessings, a 30-day devotional book was released entitled What If Your Blessings Come Through Raindrops? (Worthy Publishing, 2012 ISBN 978-1-60587-322-0). Each chapter contains thoughts, prayers and quotes along with a journaling page for the reader to recall blessings they have seen in their own lives.
