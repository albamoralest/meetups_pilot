"Speed grew up outside of Seattle and studied classical piano and clarinet from an early age. He later began studying jazz, took up the tenor saxophone, and performed in a local big band while in high school. Speed attended the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where he founded Human Feel with Andrew D'Angelo, Jim Black, and Kurt Rosenwinkel; the band continued performing after his move to New York. Speed leads or co-leads the groups Pachora (with Jim Black, Skúli Sverrisson, and Brad Shepik), The Clarinets (with Oscar Noriega and Anthony Burr), yeah NO (with Black, Sverrisson, and Cuong Vu), Trio Iffy (with Ben Perowsky and Jamie Saft), Endangered Blood (with Black, Noriega and Trevor Dunn), the Chris Speed Trio (with Dave King and Chris Tordini) and Broken Shadows (with Tim Berne, Reid Anderson and Dave King) a band dedicated to reinterpreting the music of Ornette Coleman and Julius Hemphill.
",2,== Early life and career ==
"The co-led quartet Pachora was influenced by Balkan and Middle Eastern rhythms and said to be ""immersed in Eastern European and Moroccan music"", performing originals and Greek, Bulgarian and Turkish works. Speed also performed and recorded with the Balkan brass and jazz band Slavic Soul Party!. Speed is a founding member of the avant-garde jazz groups Bloodcount (Tim Berne, Jim Black, Michael Formanek), The Claudia Quintet (John Hollenbeck, Matt Moran, Red Wierenga, and Drew Gress), AlasNoAxis (Black, Sverrisson, and Hilmar Jensson), and Heroic Frenzies (Craig Taborn, Dave King, and Chris Lightcap). In 2006 Speed created Skirl Records, a label dedicated to Brooklyn based creative music, now with over 50 releases.
",3,== Early life and career ==
