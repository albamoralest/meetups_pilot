"Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Sirone worked in Atlanta late in the 1950s and early in the 1960s with ""The Group"" alongside George Adams; he also recorded with R&B musicians such as Sam Cooke and Smokey Robinson. In 1966, in response to a call from Marion Brown, he moved to New York City, where he co-founded the ""Untraditional Jazz Improvisational Team"" with Dave Burrell. He also worked with Brown, Gato Barbieri, Pharoah Sanders, Noah Howard, Sonny Sharrock, Sunny Murray, Albert Ayler, Archie Shepp, and Sun Ra, as well as with John Coltrane when he was near the end of his career. He co-founded the Revolutionary Ensemble with Leroy Jenkins and Frank Clayton in 1971; Jerome Cooper later replaced Clayton in the ensemble, which was active for much of the decade. In the 1970s and early 1980s Sirone recorded with Clifford Thornton, Roswell Rudd, Dewey Redman, Cecil Taylor, and Walt Dickerson. In the 1980s, he was member of Phalanx, a group with guitarist James ""Blood"" Ulmer, drummer Rashied Ali, and tenor saxophonist George Adams. From 1989, he lived in Berlin, Germany, where he was active with his group 'Concord' (with Ben Abarbanel-Wolff and Ulli Bartel.) He was involved in theater, film, and was a practicing Buddhist.
