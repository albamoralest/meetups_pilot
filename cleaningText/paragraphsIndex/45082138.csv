"At the age of 20, La Rose moved to Los Angeles to become a singer and dancer. She explained: ""I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere in the Netherlands. I'd always had this belief that America was the place to be for me.""In 2010, La Rose got her first opportunity when she signed a deal with Aaliyah's former label Blackground Records, while being distributed by Interscope Records, as part of a musical duo named Amsterdam with dancer Sigourney Korper, who debuted in the music video for label mate J. Lewis and Flo Rida's ""Dancing for Me"". However, she says of this situation: ""The group didn't work out, and no music was released. It just wasn't the right time.""In 2011, La Rose appeared as the leading female dancer in Lloyd's ""Dedication to My Ex (Miss That)"". In the same year, while at an ESPY Awards after party, she went up to Flo Rida and told him that she was going to work with him one day. Impressed with La Rose's confidence, the multi-platinum international superstar invited her to the studio. Over the next two years, she performed with Flo around the world.
