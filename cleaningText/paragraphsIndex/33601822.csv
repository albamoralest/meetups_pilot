"Eth first came to be known when his vocals were featured on the Monophobe single ""Metermind"", that gained significant rotation in July 2004 on NRK P3. Emerging from the ""Klubb Kanin"" club concept in Trondheim, where he performed under the moniker of Little Horse Deep, Eth provided music for a sound installation at Storåsfestivalen in 2007. The year before he took part in founding Trondheim Thereminorkester, Norway's only theremin orchestra. Historian Ola Nordal, writing in late 2006, dubbed Trondheim Thereminorkester's debut concert ""legendary"", and during 2007 the ensemble became a prominent part of the Trondheim music scene. In 2008, Eth Eonel played at the Støy På Landet festival, as Little Horse Deep.

"Eth Eonel's first solo album, Drawing Lines (1989) was released in 2011. It marked the first in a series of albums comprising his compositions from 1989 to the present. The album also made up the main part of a master's degree assignment in Music Technology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, in which the main goal was to produce an album ""with an 80's sound"", but with the means of new technology. While the label simply presented the album as being ""alternative pop"", as evidenced in his master's degree report, Eth Eonel draws a lot of influence from the 80's synthpop, with elements as well from progressive rock and avant-rock (odd time signatures, fusion of different genres). The album was furthermore mastered by the avant-rock musician and recording engineer Bob Drake.
