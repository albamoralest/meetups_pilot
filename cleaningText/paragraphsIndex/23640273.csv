"In mid-November 2017 Fuentes was accused of statutory rape and soliciting nude photos via AOL Instant Messenger by a young woman. The incidents have alleged to occur over several years roughly a decade prior; the pair initiated contact on MySpace before meeting for the first time at a Pierce the Veil Concert at Chain Reaction club in Anaheim, California, when Fuentes was 24 and the woman was a minor of 16. The woman stated they had sex after meeting again at the Pomona concert stop during Warped Tour. The relationship was said to have lasted until she turned 18. Meanwhile a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct, specifically for requesting nude pictures from her when she was a minor. The 23-year-old opened up, first meeting Fuentes at Warped Tour 2008. Both exchanged mobile phone numbers and stayed in contact afterwards. When she turned 15, Fuentes requested nude photos from her. The band replied to these accusations in mid December. On December 16, 2017, Fuentes responded to the allegations and stated that he is taking a break from Pierce the Veil.
