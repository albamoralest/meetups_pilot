"Although he comes from several generations of bassists, he was not encouraged by them to go into music.  In an interview with ActiveBass magazine he said that he has no contact with the professional bassists in his family. His major teachers include Herman Reinshagen and Stuart Sankey, with whom he studied at the Aspen Music Festival and the Juilliard School. Karr's breakthrough came in 1962, when he was featured as a soloist in a nationally televised New York Philharmonic Young People's Concert, conducted by Leonard Bernstein.  On that famous telecast, Karr performed ""The Swan"" from The Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns. Karr also recorded the piece with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.

"In 1967 Karr founded the International Society of Bassists (ISB), an organization devoted to the study, promotion, and advancement of double bass playing around the world.

"In 2005, Karr donated his primary instrument, the Karr-Koussevitzky bass, to the ISB.  This instrument was given to Karr by Olga Koussevitzky, widow of Serge Koussevitzky, in 1961.  It is the intention of the ISB to make this valuable instrument available for use by double bassists worldwide.   The Karr-Koussevitzky bass was once believed to have been made by the Amati family and hence it is also referred to as the Amati bass. The non-profit Karr Double Bass Foundation, which loans instruments to promising young double bassists to assist in their professional development, was established by Karr in 1984.
