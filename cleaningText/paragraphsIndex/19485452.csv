"During his younger years Håkansson regularly went through his father's record collection along with Andersson, and the two soon became fans of bands such as the MC5, the Ramones, Sex Pistols, the Damned and the Rolling Stones. The Hellacopters have released six full-length albums with their own material, two non-album work compilations, and many other official releases. They have also done several tours throughout Scandinavia, Europe, the U.S.A., and Australia; they have opened for the Rolling Stones, KISS, and ZZ Top, and collaborated with artists such as Scott Morgan, the Flaming Sideburns, Backyard Babies, Quadrajets and Gluecifer. In late 2007 the band announced that they were going to break up after the release of their collection of cover songs, Head Off, and their Tour Before the Fall which ended in late October 2008.

"Håkansson's main instrument is a highly road-worn 1969 Fender Jazz Bass with almost all its paint stripped off due to constant use. For amplification Håkansson uses an Orange OR120 amplifier head which he runs through an Ampeg 8x10 cabinet; he occasionally also uses an Ampeg head with the same cabinet.
