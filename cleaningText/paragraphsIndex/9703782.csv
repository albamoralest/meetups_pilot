",1,== Career ==
"Early in his professional career, he played the accordion in a band called ""Paukova mreža"" before landing a solo recording deal with the label PGP-RTB (later called PGP-RTS). The band played throughout the then-existing Yugoslavia in places such as restaurants, hotels and discothèques. His first solo album, Ulica jorgovana (1991), was recorded in Belgrade, Serbia and his second album, Poletimo poletimo (1994), was recorded in Munich, Germany.
",2,== Career ==
"The recording of his third album, Alipašin izvor (1999), started in 1995 in Ljubljana, Slovenia but recording was put on hold until 1998. He then recorded a song entitled ""Biščanka"" and premiered it at a popular music festival in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kalač has recorded duets with Serbian singer Stoja (a 2003 remake of his 2000 song ""Tika tak"") and Bosnian singer Šemsa Suljaković (""Lažu te""; first featured on her 2000 album Ne vjerujem nikom više, later re-released on his 2003 album Voda, vazduh i sloboda). Both duets were major successes. Kalač also recorded a song with the Serbian singer Jana called ""Sunce sjalo"" for her album Malo magije (2005).

"He is a very distant relative of singer and reality star Muhedin ""Čupo"" Kalač. Sejo himself was offered to participate in Serbian reality shows Parovi (Couples) and Veliki brat (local production of Big Brother), but he rejected both opportunities, saying he did not want to participate in such a circus.
