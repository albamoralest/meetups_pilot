"Daniel ""Dude"" Mowrey (born February 10, 1972 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) is an American country music artist. Between 1991 and 1993, Mowrey recorded two studio albums, both on major labels: 1991's Honky Tonk on Capitol Records Nashville, and 1993's Dude Mowrey on Arista Nashville. These albums produced four singles for Mowrey on the Hot Country Songs charts. The first of these, ""Cowboys Don't Cry"", was later a Top 40 hit when Daron Norwood recorded it for his debut album three years after Mowrey's version. Another cut, ""Fallin' Never Felt So Good"", was later recorded by both Shawn Camp and Mark Chesnutt.

"Country singer Mel Tillis discovered Mowrey in the mid-1980s while Mowrey was still in his mid-teens; Tillis also served as Mowrey's manager, and helped the singer sign to Capitol in 1991. Mowrey's debut album, Honky Tonk, was released in 1991. Included on it was the single ""Cowboys Don't Cry"", as well as ""Honky Tonk Song"", a song which Tillis initially wrote for Webb Pierce. By 1993, Mowrey had transferred to Arista Nashville, releasing a self-titled album that year, as well as three more singles. Arista label mate Lee Roy Parnell made a guest appearance in Mowery's music video for the song ""Hold on Elroy"" which was filmed at an old cabin just outside Nashville, TN.
