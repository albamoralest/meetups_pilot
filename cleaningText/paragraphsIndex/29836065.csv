"Fallon said of the band, ""People will always say, 'why are you doing a solo record?' And I'm like, 'because I don't have anything to say with Gaslight'. Those five records, that's what you got. That's the piece. I feel it's a lot like The Replacements. There's no new music because that's all Paul [Westerberg] and the band has to say. When the book is over, it's over. And I have like… four-and-a-half records I'm really proud of.""

"Molly and the Zombies is an Americana/folk group that was formed in 2013 by Fallon with guitarist and Plow United frontman Brian McGee, former Ryan Adams and the Cardinals bassist Catherine Popper, and Scissor Sisters drummer Randy Schrager. The band performed their first show in December 2013 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, opening for the Bouncing Souls at the Stone Pony. According to Fallon, there is no record deal and there will be no album. He also said all of the band's music, which he wrote and didn't feel like using for the Gaslight Anthem, was inspired by Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited album. The band's name comes partially from the Roky Erickson song ""I Walked With a Zombie"" and a 1943 horror movie. Molly and the Zombies performed at The Bell House in Brooklyn, New York, on June 5, 2014, with Jared Hart of the Scandals and Dave Hause as opening acts.

"Brian Fallon is a Christian, but he avoids using references to his faith in his music. As he stated in an interview with spinner.com referring to the Gaslight Anthem's 2010 album American Slang, ""There are no religious songs and there never would be because the four of us, we all have different views, completely different religions...I'm very cautious not to push that on the band.""Much of the lyrics on the Gaslight Anthem's 2014 album, Get Hurt were inspired by his divorce. Fallon said “Sometimes, I don’t even know how it happened. I don’t even know how it got like this. All I know is that it did. And I now have to figure out: What do I do now?"" Fallon has since remarried and welcomed his second child.
