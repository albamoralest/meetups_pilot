"Ann-Louise holds the dubious honour of having entered the Swedish Melodifestivalen competition thirteen times without winning once, which is a record in itself. Of those entries, the songs ""Bara en enda gång"" (a duet with John Ballard) and ""Kärleken lever"" are amongst her best remembered. Ann-Louise performed one of the entries in the German preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest in 1962. Having moved to France with Bruno in the late 1980s, she now remains a resident of Kristianstad in Sweden.
