"A native of Smithville, Texas, United States, he is sometimes known by the name ""Hannibal"". He attended high school in Texas City, Texas and was in the High School band under Mr. Renfroe, a respected band director. Marvinâ€™s playing and practicing his trumpet was enjoyed in his neighborhood. In the late 1960s, he attended North Texas State University for two years, then moved to New York City and went on tour with Rahsaan Roland Kirk. He became a member of the Gil Evans orchestra, an association that lasted through the 1980s, and worked with Roy Haynes and Pharoah Sanders. As the leader of the Sunrise Orchestra, he played koto and trumpet. His debut solo album, Children of the Fire, was released in 1974.
