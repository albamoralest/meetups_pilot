",3,== Biography == | === Solo ===
". . . a landmark track in the Dialectrix cannon. A bona fide throwback song, Dialectrix raps from the perspective of a fly- observing and judging humanity from an insignificant point of view. The song is in direct parallel to the working man's plight and the feeling of helplessness that comes with being able to see everything, but being powerless to change it.

",5,== Biography == | === Solo ===
"From spitting multi-syllabic rhymes as fast as legends like Busta Rhymes and Kool G Rap (he even borrowed a beat from the former—'Break Ya Neck') to the more relaxed style of rapping Aussie MC’s are known for, this local rapper sure stamped a firm impression on the sold-out metro. Out of all the Australian rappers I’ve seen live he without-a-doubt stands out as one of the finest artists on the scene.

"According to Dom Alessio from Triple J's Home & Hosed, an Australian music radio program, Dialectrix ""was actually part of the very first hip-hop crew to take out a triple j Unearthed competition, Down Under Beats Crew, back in 2004"". In 2008 Dialectrix contributed a song to Chasm's Beyond The Mix Tape release. Tim McNamara, from Brisbane's Scene Magazine, subsequently described Dialectrix as a red-hot MC. In the same year, Obese Records owner Pegz and Dialectrix formed Gully Platoon, with Joe New and DJ 2Buck. Gully Platoon received high praise, and in 2009, Alessio commented, "". . . perhaps Gully Platoon is Australia's first hip-hop supergroup"". In 2010 Dialectrix contributed a song called ""Time Makes Fools of Us All"" to Lotek's International Rudeboy album. He also rapped on M-Phazes's ARIA award-winning album Good Gracious, on the song ""The Facilitator"".
