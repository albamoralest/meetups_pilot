"Nourbakhsh, along with Anahita Abbasi and Aida Shirazi, created the Iranian Female Composers Association. The association emerged while Niloufar started developing a concert to feature Iranian female composers at National Sawdust. Their first event was at National Sawdust in Brooklyn, NY, April 2018. The group's membership spans North America, Europe, and Asia and includes composers who write for Western and traditional Persian instruments. The mission of the group supports female composers—especially young women—from Iran through programming, commissioning, and mentorship It coordinates public performances, interdisciplinary collaborations, and workshops.

"Nourbakhsh composes for solo piano, orchestra, voice, chamber ensembles, and regularly incorporates electronic media into her compositions. Nourbakhsh's composition “F I X E D HbeaRt” for piano and live electronics was named as the First Prize Winner of the emerging composers competition by the Emilio del Rosario Music Foundation and was performed in Chicago as part of the Thirsty Ears Festival in August 2018. Nourbakhsh gained attention for her vocal piece, “An Aria for the Executive Order,” in reaction to President Donald J. Trump's Travel Ban Executive Order 13769 as part of the Hartford Women Composers Festival. The text is taken from the Travel Ban and Philip Roth's 2010 novel Nemesis. The piece and Nourbakhsh was featured on NPR in March 2017.
