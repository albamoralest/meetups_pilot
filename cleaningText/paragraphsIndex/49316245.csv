",1,== Career ==
"She began her musical career at the age of 16, with the British progressive jazz rock band Fusion Orchestra, from 1969 to 1972. Jill Saward and the Fusion Orchestra gained a following of fans who secured a record deal with EMI music to produce their first album Skeleton in Armour, an album that immediately received critical acclaim upon its debut, and is now considered a collector's item which is highly sought after. After the band Fusion Orchestra split, Saward became involved in a new all female group, called Brandy. The band, produced by Polydor, was active for about three years in the UK and Europe, before disbanding in 1976.

"Saward was spotted later by the band leader Nicky North who invited her to perform in the 'Cats Whiskers' with his own big soul funk band. She also made a name for herself as one of the UK's session singers at that time. Saward also had a brief stint with a musical group of all women, called Citizen Gang, built by a French manufacturer of Orpheus Productions, and still managed to collaborate with the Nicky North Band. It was in this period she met band, Nigel Wright and Roger Odell, who are still components of jazz-funk band Shakatak. It was through Shakatak that Saward was able to record some vocals on an experimental track of a song called ""Steppin'"", and after nine top ten hits Saward was invited to be a permanent part of the group and started to tour worldwide.
",3,== Career ==
"She became the leading voice of Shakatak sharing success for more than 35 years. The band is still touring and recording and still popular around the world, especially in Europe and the Far East. They usually publish a new album every two years for JVC Records and Secret Records. Despite constant touring and recording, Saward has always managed to find time to develop new projects, and still continues to write and record new material.

"She has been married with the bass player George Anderson, also a member of Shakatak, with whom she had two sons, Luis and James. They divorced in 2001. In 2008 the Shakatak frontwoman starred in the reality TV show Living TV's Pop Goes The Band, a show which sees former musical stars such as Bucks Fizz, Bananarama, Visage, Cleopatra, 911, Chaka Khan and more, undergoing surgery in a bid to relaunch their careers. In addition to her music career, Jill is an abstract impressionist artist who specializes in photographic prints.
