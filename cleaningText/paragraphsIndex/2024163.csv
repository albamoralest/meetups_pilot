"In 1997, guitarist Joey Tafolla left Jag Panzer for the second time, citing a lack of interest in playing heavy metal. For the band, this was a huge problem. Tafolla's guitar work was complex and technical, and as far as they knew few guitarists could comprehend it. This is when Broderick was brought into the fold of Jag Panzer and stayed with them for almost a decade.  He played on four of the band's albums. 1998's The Age of Mastery, 2000's Thane to the Throne (a concept album about William Shakespeare's play Macbeth), 2001's Mechanized Warfare, 2003's compilation album Decade of the Nail Spiked Bat and 2004's Casting the Stones.

"In late 2007, rumors had been circulating that Megadeth guitarist Glen Drover had left the band. This was proved to be true after statements released from both Glen and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. The night after the statements were released, Megadeth drummer Shawn Drover brought up Broderick as a possible replacement. Shawn then showed Mustaine a video of Broderick playing both classical and electric guitar. Mustaine was immediately won over and soon managed to get in contact with Broderick. Two weeks later, Broderick was officially declared the new guitarist for Megadeth. He made his live debut with the band on February 4, 2008, in Finland and toured with them on Gigantour 2008. He went on to record guitar parts for their twelfth album, Endgame (2009), through to their fourteenth album, Super Collider (2013).
",11,== Biography == | === Megadeth (2008–2014) ===
"Due to extensive touring with Megadeth, Broderick was no longer be able to collaborate with Jag Panzer and Nevermore. Mustaine said that when he partnered up with Broderick, he said that it reminded him of when ""Ozzy Osbourne met Randy Rhoads"". On March 8, 2009, Mustaine commented that he thought Broderick was the greatest guitarist Megadeth had ever had. In the then-current line up of the band, he was the youngest member in Megadeth. During his time with Megadeth, Broderick had to stop playing his trademark seven-string guitar and adopt a six-string guitar. Broderick said that ""Dave [Mustaine] felt a seven-string guitar wasn't an original thrash metal instrument. Therefore he felt it would be better if I used six strings."" He said in an interview with Total Guitar that he would stay with Megadeth as long as they were happy to have him.

"On November 25, 2014, Broderick posted a message on his website saying he was parting ways with Megadeth: ""Due to artistic and musical differences, it is with great reluctance that I announce my departure from Megadeth to pursue my own musical direction. I want all of you to know how much I appreciate the amount that you the fans have accepted and respected me as a member of Megadeth for the last seven years, but it is time for me to move on. I wish Dave and everyone in Megadeth all the best. I am working on a few things of my own and hope that when they come out, you will all dig it.""
