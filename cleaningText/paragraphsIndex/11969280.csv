"Gilbert's musical career began with his first band Mothra in Birmingham, Alabama. Shortly after, they changed their name to This Endearing, and sent a demo to Tim Lambesis, frontman of As I Lay Dying. This Endearing disbanded in 2006 and Gilbert went on to join As I Lay Dying. Gilbert was As I Lay Dying's bassist from 2006 until 2014, when Lambesis was arrested. Before Lambesis' arrest, Gilbert performed in two of Lambesis' side-projects, Austrian Death Machine and Pyrithion. For the Pyrithion EP, Gilbert contributed bass as a session musician as well as JP Andrade on drums, with the official members being, Lambesis, Ryan Glissen (formerly of Allegaeon), and Andrew Godwin (formerly of Embodyment and The Famine).  With Austrian Death Machine, Gilbert performed vocals on the two albums, Total Brutal and Double Brutal, and performed bass for the live band.

"After Lambesis' arrest, the remaining members of AILD, guitarists Nick Hipa and Phil Sgrosso, and drummer Jordan Mancino formed Wovenwar. It was assumed that Gilbert was originally the vocalist, though it was later discovered that though he was, the primary vocalist was Shane Blay. After AILD went on hiatus, the band was approached by Brian Slagel, Metal Blade Records owner. The band has released two albums, Wovenwar (2014) and Honor Is Dead (2016).

"Gilbert also performed in a project called Year One, together with Lee Turner, former bandmate and former drummer of Maylene and the Sons of Disaster, All In and This Endearing members Clayton Graves, Joseph McQueen, as well as Marko Gorupic of Legion and My Reply. In addition to touring full time with As I Lay Dying, he also co-owns and operates recording studio Sparrow Sound with his business partner Joseph McQueen out of Los Angeles.
