"Ogata began working as a musical actress, attending the same classes alongside Rumi Kasahara and Shiho Niiyama. She used to be affiliated with Aoni Production. Because of her husky voice, she is often typecast as either young men and boys or tomboyish females (a famous example of this being Sailor Uranus, a popular character from Sailor Moon, known for being a charming tomboy in her civilian form). It is also because of this that she is sometimes referred as ""Aniki"" (""Big Brother"" in Japanese, usually used in gangs) by fans. She married for the second time on April 1, 2004, and appeared with Ichirou Mizuki on NHK's second anime song marathon on April 30.
