"Lloyd Charmers was born in Kingston, Jamaica. His professional career began in 1962, when he performed as the Charmers with Roy Willis on Vere Johns' Talent Hour, starting a recording career soon afterward. When the Charmers split, he joined Slim Smith and Martin Jimmy Riley in the Uniques. Charmers subsequently moved on to a solo career, releasing two albums in 1970, and also recording X-rated tracks such as ""Birth Control"" and the album Censored, these more risqué outings appearing under his real name or as 'Lloydie & The Lowbites'. He was also briefly a member of the Messengers, a short-lived supergroup that featured Ken Boothe, B. B. Seaton and Busty Brown.

"He set up his own record label Splash in the early 1970s, and moved into production. Productions by him were notable for their sophisticated arrangements. With his session band the Now Generation he produced artists such as Ken Boothe (including some of Boothe's most successful solo releases of the period, such as his cover of David Gates' ""Everything I Own""), B. B. Seaton, the Gaylads, and Lloyd Parks.
