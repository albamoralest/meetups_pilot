"Born in Mobile, Alabama, United States, Green was taught the piano as a child by his mother. He learned jazz and popular tunes from the beginning. He started to play trombone, which both older brothers played, when he was about 12. Although he listened to trombonists Tommy Dorsey, J. C. Higginbotham, Jack Jenney, Jack Teagarden and Trummy Young, he has said he was more influenced by the styles of Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young. His style was also influenced by the vocals of Perry Como and Louis Armstrong. At Auburn High School he was a member of The Auburn Knights Orchestra.

"When Green was fifteen years old, his father died, and he began his music career, first with Tommy Reynolds in California, then with Bob Strong, Jan Savitt, and Frankie Carle. In California, he finished high school at the Hollywood Professional School in Los Angeles. In 1947, he joined Gene Krupa's band. Three years later, he and his brother Jack became members of Woody Herman's Thundering Herd. In 1953, he moved to New York City, and a year later was voted New Star trombonist in the International Critics Poll of Down Beat magazine. During the 1950s and 1960s he toured with Benny Goodman, and led the Tommy Dorsey orchestra after Dorsey's death in 1956. He worked with record producer Enoch Light on the albums The Persuasive Trombone of Urbie Green and 21 Trombones. Green spent his later life with his second wife Kathy, a jazz singer, at their home in the Poconos region of Pennsylvania.
