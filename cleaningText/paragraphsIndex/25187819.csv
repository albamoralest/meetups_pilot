In The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings (Eighth Edition) this CD was recognized with four (out of five) stars. For a few years Honing organised a special concert named Winterreise in Paradiso (Amsterdam). In December 2015 they did their final show. After the success of the Yuri Honing Wired Paradise, which was characterised by their rock influence and electric guitars, Honing founded the Yuri Honing Acoustic Quartet in 2012. In 2016 they won the Edison award for 'Best Instrumental Jazz Album' for their second CD Desire (2015). Their third album Goldbrun (2018) proceeded to win this award as well, making it his third Edison in total.
