"The film received critical acclaim upon its premiere at Sundance.

Maclean—and offers an inventive treat for fans of the Western."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Rodrigo Perez of The Playlist in his review said: ""Slow-burning and simmering, Slow West knows how to kick the voltage into high gear."" Bilge Ebiri of New York magazine gave the film a positive review, and said that it is ""an absurdist, melancholy coming-of-age tale that jumps from odd comedy to striking violence to stirring reflection"". Michelle Orange of SBS gave the film four-out-of-five stars, and said that ""Slow West is defined by a kind of loving ambivalence—about its hero, its genre, and perhaps most of all about a landscape so harsh and so beautiful it almost makes a man hope to die.""
