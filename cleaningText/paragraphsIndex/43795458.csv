The band was short-lived and he joined The Pop Group in 1977, serving as one of their guitarists. He performed on their two albums, Y and For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?, which were critically acclaimed. After The Pop Group disbanded in 1981, he was asked to join another post-punk band, Maximum Joy. He was also involved in the short-lived German electro outfit U-BahnX with Disc O'Dell. Waddington has been absent from past Pop Group reunions and his last performance credit was on Lily Allen's 2006 album Alright, Still.
