"His first mixtape, Pure Koke Volume One, was given away for free on various online outlets. Following extensive radio play, he signed a deal with Roc Nation. At the time of signing to Roc Nation, Georgiou was preparing to release Pure Koke Volume Two. He released visuals for singles ""Nobody But Us"" feat Abel Miller, ""Lord Knows"" feat Don Jaga and ""Streets Are Cold"" which features Birmingham's UK rap veteran Malik MD7. However, his music career was stopped abruptly as he was arrested for attempted murder. This meant Pure Koke: Volume 2 was released with very little promotion due to his disappearance.
