"Slater realized that making concert posters was what he wanted to do after discovering  gigposters.com. He started producing posters professionally when aged 24. His first professional poster commission was for Pretty Girls Make Graves. He started sending unsolicited White Stripes poster designs to the band's tour manager and this led to him working with Rob Jones, who produced The White Stripes' gig posters, and later collaborations between Jones and Slater on gig posters for Jack White and Dave Matthews. Slater turned freelance in 2004.
