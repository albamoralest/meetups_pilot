"Moss has a large fan base in Australia. In 2002, he participated in a live performance of Sydney alternative rock band the Drugs' single ""The Bold and the Beautiful"" on Rove Live, playing bass guitar. In 2006, a campaign surfaced to vote Moss as Australian of the Year. Moss was featured in a very popular television commercial for Berri, an Australian orange juice producer. The punchline of the advertisement was ""you can tell when it's not all Aussie""— a line intended to show (in jest) that, while Moss has longstanding connections with Australia, his Hollywood career has resulted in his persona differing significantly from that of the cliché Australian male. He has appeared occasionally on the former program Rove Live when in Australia. He takes part in sketches that are parodies of the daytime TV genre.
