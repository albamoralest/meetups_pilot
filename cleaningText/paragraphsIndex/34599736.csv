"In 1979 he released Inland, his first album as Pyrolator. The cover stated: Pyrolator Synthesizer Inland, the music is quite experimental, close to industrial music, incorporating field recordings and harsh electronica. On the follow-up Ausland (1981) he worked with a list of Ata Tak associated guests including his Der Plan colleagues and Holger Hiller. The songs range from experimental electronica to synth-pop, where Wunderland (1984) became his most playful, melodic and popular effort with references to world music.
