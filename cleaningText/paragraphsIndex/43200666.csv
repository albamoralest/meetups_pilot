"Yin has received considerable attention for his remixes of popular R&B songs and solo tracks. He has performed as Giraffage at numerous locations worldwide, including the Boiler Room, Low End Theory, NYU Kimmel and more. His music has won praise from blogs such as Pitchfork, XLR8R, and The FADER. His songs have been described as ""pleasantly ambient and sample-laden instrumentals"", or ""bedroom dream-pop"", and feature ""atmospheric pads ... familiar, hip-hop-flavored 808 percussion"", ""looping guitars, 808 thuds and clacks, and diced-up vocals"". His music is compared with that of Shlohmo and Baths. Giraffage released his debut EP Pretty Things in May 2011. He released his debut album, Comfort, later in 2011. In 2012, he went on a 30-date European tour with Orlando producer XXYYXX after releasing the shared EP Even Though. In a review, The FADER wrote that Even Though ""shines with swelling bass, surprise birdcalls and geysers of sound, like you tossed a penny in a well and $40 in quarters splashed up."" Giraffage has also collaborated with other musicians, as he released the single ""Move Me"" with Jhameel and DWNTWN in 2013. Giraffage signed to Alpha Pup Records in early 2013. In February 2013, he released his second album Needs. In fall 2013, he toured across the US in support of Phantogram. In February 2014, he remixed the entirety of The-Dream's Love/Hate LP, receiving approval from The FADER, who stated they could not ""remember a moment of anticipation right before hitting the play button as happy as the one I just experienced."" Among other festivals, he notably performed at Coachella in 2018, the Treasure Island Music Festival 2013, the Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival 2013, Decibel Festival 2013, What the Festival in Oregon in June 2014 and UCSD's Sun God Festival in May 2014.
