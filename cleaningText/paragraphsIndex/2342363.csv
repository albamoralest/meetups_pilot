He made his debut on 1994's Murder Was the Case soundtrack with the R&B track ""Come When I Call"" (produced by DJ Quik). In 1995, he released his first single titled ""Slip N Slide"" (produced by Reggie Moore and co-produced by DeVante Swing) with then-unknown artist Ginuwine singing the chorus. The video for the song was shot in Cabo, and also features scenes with 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Tha Dogg Pound. Danny is best known for singing the choruses of the 2Pac songs ""I Ain't Mad at Cha"", ""What'z Ya Phone #"", ""Picture Me Rollin'"" and ""Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find"" on All Eyez on Me, as well as ""Toss It Up"" on The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory.

On April 20, 2010, Death Row Records, under new management, finally released Danny Boy's 1996 debut album It's About Time featuring production by DJ Quik and DeVante Swing.
