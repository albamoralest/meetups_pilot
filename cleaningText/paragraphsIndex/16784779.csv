"Hadrien Feraud was born into a very musical family. His parents -- who are also musicians -- immersed him at a very young age in various musical environments: rock 'n roll, blues, funk, R&B, new wave, and, of course, jazz. Hadrien began studying guitar at age 8, taking lessons from his father. He also had a deep interest in film scores. By the time he was 10 he started picking up bass lines from Earth, Wind & Fire, music of the Motown era, The Police, Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Prince, Chic, Donald Fagen, ZZ Top, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Kool and the Gang, Don Blackman and later also Weather Report, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin and Herbie Hancock. But at first he was actually more interested in playing drums until he received a copy of The Birthday Concert by Jaco Pastorius at age 12. After hearing Jaco Pastorius everything changed. Hadrien immersed himself in profound studies of electric bass, analyzing the techniques of Jaco Pastorius, James Jamerson, Bernard Edwards, Nathan East, Christian McBride, Victor Bailey, Anthony Jackson, Skúli Sverrisson, Gary Willis, Matthew Garrison, Richard Bona, Linley Marthe and Jeff Berlin.  Hadrien's talent on bass has become widely known throughout the world.
