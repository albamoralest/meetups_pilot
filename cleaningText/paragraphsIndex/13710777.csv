"Tatsuya Oe was born in Hiroshima, Japan. At the age of 12, he showed great interest in rock, pop, and electronic music, and at the age of 14, decided to buy his first electric guitar, synthesizer, and sequencer. In school days he formed several bands performing rock, synthpop/new wave, heavy metal, and even prog rock. While he couldn't find bandmates for playing his favorite funk or black music since those kinds of music was nearly unknown in Japan at that time, a few years later he found excitement in playing DJ to the audience and got attracted by dance/club music such as rare groove, disco, house, and hip hop. After he majored in economics at and graduated from Tokyo University, while working for an advertising company, he started composition/music production with his computer. His demo tapes were acclaimed by several European dance/techno labels and he released his debut 12 inches called Dazzlin' from Italian label ACV under the name of Tatsuya Oe in 1997. Since Encounter with... album (1998), he burst onto the club scene as the maverick solo project ""Captain Funk.""""Captain Funk will make you believe!” was The Ministry of Sound magazine’s opinion, while Time Out Mag described his music as a ""Vibrant delight!” Fatboy Slim (Norman Cook) described his record as ""F***ing insane!” and demanded extra copies. The Fatboy was not alone obviously, as Tatsuya has earned the praise and respect of international DJs from across the board such as Coldcut, Si Begg, Freddy Fresh, Ken Ishii and Carl Cox.  Captain Funk released successful singles, mix CDs and albums including Bustin' Loose EP, Dancing in the Street, Style, etc. Especially his second album Songs of the Siren was selected as one of ""The Year in Music 2001 Critic’s Choice"" of the Billboard magazine. Metropolis described the album, ""Listeners familiar with his last release, Songs of the Siren, will recognize many of the elements that made the album one of the most original and musically innovative to come out of Japan in the last two years.""He also has played DJ at many gigs and big events in Japan such as Fuji Rock Festival and overseas including UK (Turnmills, Heaven, etc.), France (Global Tekno, Festival de Saint-Nolff, etc.), Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.
