"During her concert tours, Eyck has collaborated with other musicians and orchestras including Heinz Holliger, Robert Kolinsky, Gerhard Oppitz, Andrey Boreyko, Michael Sanderling, Gürer Aykal, John Storgårds, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Bern Symphony Orchestra, the Essen Philharmonic Orchestra, the Brandenburg State Orchestra, the Stuttgart Philharmonic Orchestra, the Lapland Chamber Orchestra, the Heidelberg Symphonic Orchestra and the Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg.

"The theremin concerto ""Dancefloor With Pulsing"" by the French composer Regis Campo was written for Eyck and premiered with the Brussels Philharmonic in 2018. In 2006, Eyck published the first extensive theremin method book entitled ""The Art of Playing the Theremin"". With her playing technique the player is able to tune the theremin to their hand and rely on their finger positions, rather than correcting notes after they are audible. Since 2010 she has been the artistic director of the Theremin Summer Academy in Colmar, France, and has since conducted workshops, lectures and master classes worldwide. Also in 2006 Eyck was the winner of the International Competition for Composers arranged by Radio/TV Berlin-Brandenburg in 2006. She has since conducted workshops, lectures and Masterclasses in Germany, Sweden, Poland, Great Britain, the United States of America, Mexico and Japan. In 2010, Eyck received her Bachelor of music degree in viola at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm, Sweden.
