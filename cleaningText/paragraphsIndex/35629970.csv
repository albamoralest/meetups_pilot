"Tommy Marth was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was the middle of three children to Las Vegas singer Diane Eddington and father Thomas Christian Marth Sr., who met Marth's mother while playing stringed instruments throughout Las Vegas in the early 1960s. Tom Sr. taught Marth how to play the drums when he was 4, according to Marth who said in an interview, ""When I saw that he liked the thought of me playing I stopped"". It wasn't until Marth heard a cassette tape of Stan Getz when he decided to play the saxophone. Described by his sister as having a familial bond akin to ""The Three Musketeers"", Marth had a very close relationship with his musician siblings, who include older brother Ryan Marth and younger sister Melissa Marth, both members of the Las Vegas indie band The Big Friendly Corporation. Tommy attended Chaparral High School in Paradise where he met the future bass player for The Killers, Mark Stoermer in jazz band. While still in high school, Tommy worked as a fashion model for Tommy Hilfiger, Jaguar, and appeared in the video for Sting's Desert Rose. Tommy would also appear in the video for Passion Fruit's Sun Fun Baby in 2000. He later attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas where he received his bachelor's degree in film.

"On July 4, 2012, Black Camaro released their album Black Camaricans which features Tommy Marth along with his siblings Melissa and Ryan on the song Phantom of the Moon. Black Camaro's Brian Garth tells Las Vegas CityLife, ""We [originally] had this as a song that Tommy dominates with saxophone. But now it's not about that. It's about that it could be the last thing he [recorded]. And I have it, and I have the ability to do this. And I have the Marths as friends to come in and do it.""
