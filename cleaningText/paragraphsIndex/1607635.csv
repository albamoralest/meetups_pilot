"In 2001, before the band signed to a major label, Comeau, Bouvier and their longtime best friend Patrick Langolis launched the apparel company Role Model Clothing before the band was signed to a record deal in an effort to create clothes that represented their lifestyle and their love of music. And in some music videos of Simple Plan it can be seen that the band members are using the clothes. Role Model Clothing has an apparel collection. Ever since 2010, the brand stopped being active mostly due to Simple Plan being very busy working on (and later promoting) their fourth studio album Get Your Heart On!. In an interview for SimplePlan.cz in 2013, Comeau explained the ""hiatus"" of their clothing line and talked a bit more about its future:
",10,== Career == | === Clothing line ===
"We partnered up with someone to help us make it bigger and the partnership didn't really work out. So we ended up splitting from that person and that company. And with the last record we've been so busy and we didn't have a lot of time to put into it. It's still something that I wanna do and I think that now that we're touring a little less, we wanna revive the project. So to me, Role Model is not dead, we just hit pause on it for a little bit and I would like to revive it. I just think we'll go back to simple things like hoodies and caps and t-shirts, because when we tried to take the line into a full line, it was too much and it was too quick. And I think it will be much better to keep it simple, keep it to what you guys wear, what we wear anyway.
