"In Ramadan 2019, Aktaş shared a video of himself on social media in which he would start to recite adhan loudly close to people who were waiting for iftar and then laugh as they would actually believe it was the time for iftar. The video went viral on social media and received criticism from various people. In the television program Söylemezsem Olmaz, the subject was taken on by the theologian Arif Arslan. Arslan reacted to the video and questioned Aktaş's actions: ""Doesn't he have a mom or dad, did this child pop out of a stone hole?"".
