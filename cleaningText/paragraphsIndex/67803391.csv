"Jeff Janiak was born in Livingston, New Jersey on November 4, 1976, and spent the first years of his life in Irvington, New Jersey until moving to Toms River, New Jersey in the late 1970s. Janiak is a relative of the actor William Campbell. Janiak had a major interest in horror films and occult books during his youth. Janiak described himself to Metal Transistor as ""a strange kid that felt like he couldn't fit in anywhere"". Janiak started skateboarding at a young age, and eventually would start skating competitively winning numerous competitions which would land him a sponsorship. Janiak was than recruited by local pro skateboarder Jeff Jones to ride for his demo team, which would see Janiak doing skate demos around the tri-state area. His introduction to music started when he began listening to his parents records and his mother gave him her copy of The Monster Mash. By the age of ten, Janiak was introduced to punk rock music through skateboarding, than later hearing the Dead Kennedys Plastic Surgery Disasters album which ultimately gained his attention to the genre. At the age of 13, Janiak attended his first punk rock gig watching Ramones at City Gardens in Trenton, New Jersey. Janiak's introduction to playing music began at the age of 12 when he taught himself how to play the drums, than at the age of 14, he started his first band Chaotic Discharge. Janiak attended Toms River High School East, than at age 17 he dropped out of high school than went missing. Janiak went to Philadelphia for a short period, and was staying in a squat. He briefly returned to New Jersey, only to play his final gig with Chaotic Discharge at The Stone Pony. After the gig, Janiak than hitched a ride to the Lower East Side of Manhattan where he had got involved in the anarcho punk scene and ended up squatting in an abandoned community building until it was shut down by the NYPD. After the squat was shut, Janiak than spent the remainder of his time in New York City living in and around Tompkins Square Park. During this time, he developed a drug addiction which would last from his late teens to his mid twenties. His whereabouts were discovered when he was seen on a news report about the anniversary of the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot. Multiple photos of Janiak began to emerge in various publications about punk rock, anarchy and fashion from during his time living in New York. At age 21, Janiak was arrested and charged with drug possession. He served time at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility.  Upon his release, Janiak cleaned himself up and started a career in the automotive industry spray painting cars. After an eight year hiatus, Janiak returned to writing and playing music. Janiak made his come back not as a drummer, but as a vocalist. He had joined the band Dead Heros in 2002. In 2003, Janiak recorded his first release with the band at Twain Studios with recording engineer Bob Both and producer Marty Munsch who would teach Janiak the basics of recording production. In 2008, Janiak left Dead Heros. He than left the US and moved to Stoke-on-Trent, England.
