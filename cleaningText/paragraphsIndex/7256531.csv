Reid had a number 21 hit in the UK in 1988 with the collaboration with Coldcut, ""Stop This Crazy Thing"". He had an even bigger hit in 1990, with ""I'm Free"", recorded with The Soup Dragons, reaching number 5. Meanwhile, 1989's ""One Blood"" saw him re-established at the forefront of the reggae scene.
