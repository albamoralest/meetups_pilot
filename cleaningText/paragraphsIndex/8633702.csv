Dogra was named the 6th Most Powerful Sports Agent in 2008 by Sports Business Journal.   He has also represented more first round draft choices than any other NFL agent since 2004. Dogra was formerly co-head of CAA Football with Tom Condon. CAA released Dogra on November 13, 2014, for probable cause due to rumors of him starting his own sports agency. On March 26, 2019, Dogra sued former client Robert Griffin III for $685,000 as a result of Griffin allegedly not paying his 15% of marketing and endorsement fees as stated in his contract with Dogra. According to court filings, Griffin paid Dogra $12,975 of an invoice of $389,803 in fees in 2014, $36,371 of $258,559, and no money of $58,714 in fees in 2018.
