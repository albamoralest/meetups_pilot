"Key released her first, self-titled album in 2001 at the age of 17. Her first single was the song ""Escondido"" (""Hidden"") in which she sang the suggestive lyrics 'We went out to make out and to make love'. The song received much airplay thanks to her then-boyfriend, Brazilian funk singer Latino, who she had dated for years, and the risqué lyrics.

"Her big breakthrough was the song ""Baba"" (""Drool"") which was the biggest hit in the country during 2001 and 2002. In the controversial song and music video, Kelly provokes an older man that ignored her when she was young and infatuated with him, but now that she's older, is sexually attracted to her. Thanks to the success of the song, the album went 2x platinum in Brazil and selling over 500.000 copies. In 2002 was released to international markets. Furthermore, Key's first two singles comprised highly explicit sexual content; although, the albums appealed predominantly to minors. The album would later tender two more successful singles: Cachorrinho (""Little Dog""), about a petulant man and his eventual apprehension of the reality of his relationship with his female boss, and ""Anjo"" (""Angel""), a sad ballad. Both songs received major airplay and were big radio hits.
