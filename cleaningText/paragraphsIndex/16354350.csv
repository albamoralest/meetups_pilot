"""I grew up always banging on things,"" Pelton said describing his childhood. His first real musical instrument was a cello in 5th grade. But he ""bailed as soon as possible to the drums,"" Pelton said. ""I was running around doing gigs at 14, which was a great situation, to actually be in a band that young. The sooner you start making music with other people the better.""

"In 1985, Pelton earned a bachelor's degree and a Performer's Certificate after his studies at Indiana University's Jacobs School of Music in Bloomington, Indiana, according to Drummerworld. While there, Pelton studied with Kenny Aronoff, who at the time was the drummer for John Mellencamp, Drummerworld reported. Mellencamp lives just a short distance away from Bloomington. During summer break, Pelton sought out experts elsewhere. ""I also had the privilege of hanging with Alan Dawson for a couple of summers,"" he told Edge. The Massachusetts-based Dawson, legendary in the jazz world, may best be known as an early teacher of Tony Williams—drummer for Miles Davis.
