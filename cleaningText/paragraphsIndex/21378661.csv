"Moerlen first played with Gong on 1974's You, Pierre already being a member. He joined more permanently for Gazeuse! (1976) and Expresso II (1978) when the band had come under Pierre's leadership. The latter was released under the Gong name in the UK, but as by Pierre Moerlen's Gong in North America. The band toured Europe in support. Benoît remained with the band for Downwind (1979) and Live (released 1980). Having left in 1979, Benoît joined Pierre in Mike Oldfield's touring band, and he appears on the resultant live album Exposed (1979).
