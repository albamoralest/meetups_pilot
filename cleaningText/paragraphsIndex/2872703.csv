"Weiss was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California to a Jewish family, and began playing guitar at the age of 16. According to her interviews, her two elder sisters introduced her ""to good music"". She left Hollywood at age of 17. She attended San Francisco State University and graduated with a degree in photography.

"While in college in San Francisco, Weiss became involved in the local club scene, following local bands such as Camper Van Beethoven and the Donner Party, and absorbing their punky/DIY ethos. When she was 22, Weiss was invited to learn the drums to join an all-girl trio called the Furies as their replacement drummer for a West Coast tour. The Furies' guitarist found Weiss a drum kit at a local pawn shop, and with one drum lesson and about two weeks practice under her belt, she became the Furies' second drummer. Self-taught as a drummer, Weiss learned her technique by watching the drummers at innumerable live shows, and by studying rock and punk greats like John Bonham and Topper Headon. She moved to Portland, Oregon in 1989 and soon after began playing with former Donner Party leader, Sam Coomes, in a band called Motorgoat. (Motorgoat disbanded and reformed as Quasi in 1993; Coomes is Weiss's ex-husband.)

"Weiss started playing with Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein in Sleater-Kinney in 1996, after seeing them play a show. Tucker and Brownstein then played her a new song they were working on at the time, ""Dig Me Out."" Her bandmates later said that she made up a beat so solid ""you could practically bang your head against it."" Weiss eventually became the band's drummer; she was the fourth in the band's history. Brownstein has described Weiss as ""one of the most musically intelligent people I know"" and ""certainly the most musically gifted member of the band, the one with the largest musical lexicon and sphere from which to draw influence and reference.""On July 1, 2019, Sleater-Kinney announced via social media that Weiss would be leaving the group and would not be joining their upcoming fall tour. Weiss said that the band was taking a ""new direction"" and that it was time for her to exit.
