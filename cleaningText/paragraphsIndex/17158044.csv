"== Critics' observations ==
",8,== Critics' observations ==
"Brüninghaus has become known in fusion jazz for his subtle chord layering and widely varying melodic changes, but without neglecting the rhythmical flow. Brüninghaus is the most imaginative exponent of minimal art. In his improvisation and compositions, he combines repetitive minimalist patterns with phrasing reminiscent of Bill Evans.
