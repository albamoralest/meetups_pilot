"Reina was a backup singer for such music artists as Deborah Cox and Corina. In 1995, she released a self-titled R&B album as Lori Gold, and had a minor hit with ""I Likes"". In 1998, as Reina, she became an overnight sensation on the Dance/Club scene when ""Find Another Woman"" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 2003, she scored her biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when her single ""No One's Gonna Change You"" crossed over from the dance charts. In 2004 when ""If I Close My Eyes"" went to number 2 on Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, she garnered her biggest dance hit and in 2005 scored another top 5 on the same chart with ""Forgive"". All 3 tracks were from her third album overall, but first under her new name Reina ""This Is Reina"". Reina is promoted by AJ Iacona.
