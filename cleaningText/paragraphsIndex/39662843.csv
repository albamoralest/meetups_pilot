"Before he became a solo artist, Tyler was a member of Lambchop and Silver Jews beginning in 1998. Tyler first joined Lambchop at the age of 19 because Kurt Wagner approached him about playing the organ in the band. However, it turned out that he got to play guitar because he admittedly said ""I couldn't really play"" the organ. Before releasing music under his own name, Tyler used The Paper Hats as working title for his solo music. In 2010, Tyler released a universally acclaimed album entitled Behold the Spirit, and in 2013 released another critically acclaimed album entitled Impossible Truth. This was followed by his third full length, Modern Country, which was hailed by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the ""best country albums of 2016"".
