"Mary Oliver is referred to as an internationally acclaimed Amsterdam violinist.  To quote the Austin Music Co-op website, ""Her premieres of new works by John Cage, Richard Barrett, Brian Ferneyhough, and Iannis Xenakis speak to the level of virtuosity she has achieved. Her equally brilliant work as an improviser is a rarity in the ranks of first-rate classical interpreters.""
