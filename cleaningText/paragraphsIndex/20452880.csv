"De Ramón studied at The Grange School in Santiago and soon graduated as an architect from the Catholic University of Chile. He spent an important part of its youth in the country in the Colchagua province where he became absorbed by the fundamentals of the Chilean culture of the Central Zone, crossing it by horse and taking feeling of its roots, falling in love deeply with the basis of Chilean heritage which would be reflected widely in his later work.
