"Joe Mabbott is an American record producer and studio audio engineer who has worked with many independent and mainstream artists of the 1990s 2000s and 2010s including Atmosphere, Snoop Dogg, Brother Ali, Cloud Cult and The Matches. In addition to record engineering, Joe Mabbott owns and operates The Hideaway Studio housed in the historic Grain Belt Brewery building in Northeast Minneapolis. The main live room at the Hideaway is a generously sized at 25x35 feet with 14-foot ceilings, with half of the room being concrete and exposed brick, and the other half sheetrock and sound-treated, allowing exceptional ambience when desired. For additional tracking purposes, The Hideaway Studio has two rooms in addition to the main live room at its disposalâ€”the vocal booth, which at 9x14 feet can easily accommodate a drum kit or an isolated bagpiper, and a medium-sized room measuring 11x20 feet, made largely of reflective tile that allows for a massive drum sound.
