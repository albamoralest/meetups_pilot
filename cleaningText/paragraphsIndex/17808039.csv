"Born in Liverpool to a father of Swedish descent and mother of Irish descent, he is known for his work with 1960s bands The Big Three and The Merseybeats, and for singing on the original recording of Jesus Christ Superstar as Simon Zealotes. He made an appearance on Roger Glover's The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast album track, ""Watch Out for the Bat"", as a vocalist. He is probably best known for playing bass guitar for several re-incarnations of the Ian Gillan Band and for his earlier participation in the progressive rock band, Quatermass. He also re-formed The Pirates, originally the backing band for Johnny Kidd. Gustafson was a member of Roxy Music for four years and performed on three studio albums. His final record with the band, Siren, included their only American top 40 hit single, ""Love Is the Drug"". Frontman Bryan Ferry later called Gustafson a ""wonderful player"", adding, ""“Love Is the Drug” wouldn’t have been anything without the bass playing. It really bought that track alive.""He was bassist on several tracks for Flamenco guitarist Juan Martin's 1981 concept album, Picasso Portraits (Flamencovision CD FV 03, 1994) namely: Harlequin – 1918, Desire Caught By The Tail – 1943, The Aficionado – 1912 and Girls of Algiers – 1955.
