He was also the winner of the 2011 Carsblad Music Festival Composers’ Competition and has been hailed by the New York Times as ""richly talented"" and by The New Yorker as a ""maverick song composer.""Cooper is an associate professor at West Chester University and previously served on the faculty at Amherst College.

"Cooper's largest projects include Silver Threads, a song cycle for voice and electronic track released by Nonesuch Records, and Ripple the Sky, a work for voice and processed string octet commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association. These works highlight Cooper's focus on slow development and the stretching of musical time. Many of Cooper's compositions involve live processing and electronics, and his interest in the digital realm extends to visual media: his video series Triptych was screened at the 2012 MATA Festival, and his piece Commencer une autre mort was shortlisted for the Guggenheim exhibit YouTube Play: A Biennial of Creative Video (2010).
