"Gopalakrishnan had researched playing technique, and developed particular fingering and bowing disciplines of the ""Parur style"" to produce a clarity of sound and speed of delivery. His style includes one-finger playing and a thematic development on single-string octaves. Violinist Yehudi Menuhin said of a Gopalakrishnan's playing: ""I have not heard such violin in all my travels! How superbly this young Indian is playing our instrument"".

"Shri Gopalakrishnan said when he was receiving his Sangita Kalanidhi award from the Music Academy of Madras ""My practice is the only secret of my success and then the other secret is my father. The practice that I was used to was nearly 15–16 hours a day and that was a very tough one where I used to jump suddenly from Carnatic to Hindustani styles while playing. Anything, any award I receive is just the fruit of my practice"".
