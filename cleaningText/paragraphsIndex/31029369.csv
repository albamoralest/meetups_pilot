"White released the album The Long Goodbye in 2008. The following year, White joined Joy Williams to form The Civil Wars. The duo won the 2012 Grammy Awards for best Folk Album, and Country Performance by a Duo or Group. In 2015, he contributed the song ""Kyrie"", a duet with Emmylou Harris, to the album Mercyland: Hymns for the Rest of Us, Vol. II. Then in 2016, White released a solo ""Simple Song"" for the album Southern Family by Dave Cobb. White is a co-owner of Single Lock Records, which he founded in his hometown of Florence, Alabama, together with Ben Tanner (of the Alabama Shakes) and Florence financial consultant, Will Trapp.  The label has signed multiple artists from the Muscle Shoals area, including the legendary ""Funky"" Donnie Fritts, along with indie standouts like Lera Lynn.  White often collaborates with the artists on the Single Lock label.

"In 2018, White embarked on a little-publicized house concert tour to get feedback on new material.  His loyal fans obliged, and this culminated with the April 2019 release of his album The Hurting Kind. The album was a bit of a departure from White's Southern Rock and Americana roots, and was an intentional tribute to the country music he grew up listening to.  White co-wrote ""I Wish I Could Write You a Song"" with ""Whispering"" Bill Anderson, resulting in a distinctly Orbison feel on the track.  White toured in 2019 with several Single Lock artists, including acclaimed newcomer Erin Rae.
