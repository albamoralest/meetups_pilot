"Glaser was raised in a family where both parents were professional musicians. From 1952 to 1956 she studied with classical pianist Robert Riefling, and later with Vlado Perlemuter in Paris. Her debut concert was in Oslo in 1960. She has lectured at the Norwegian Academy of Music from 1973, where she was appointed professor in 1994. Her paternal half-brother is cellist Ernst Simon Glaser. Glaser has cooperated with the conductor Sir John Barbirolli. Having been a soloist in Prokofiev's third piano concerto, in Oslo under his taktstock, he invited her to Hallé Orchestra in Manchester 1962, with the same concert, and in 1963 she played Grieg's A minor concert with him and Hallé Orchestra on tour. Glaser's repertoire ranges widely. She has played a lot of French music that she became close to during their studies in Paris. The classical repertoire might have been her closest, but she has also performed much Norwegian music, especially chamber music Grieg and compositions for piano solo, and has for many years been a regular performer at the Festspillene i Bergen (Bergen International Festival). She has collaborated with Arve Tellefsen for several years. She was appointed Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 2018.
