"In March 2019, Taki was arrested on suspicion of cocaine use and his latest video game, Judgment, was withdrawn from sale by the publisher, Sega. His appearance has been removed in the Western release. He was later released on bail on April 4, 2019. Having admitted to using cocaine, the Tokyo District court sentenced him to eighteen months in prison, suspended for three years. His voice acting roles were also replaced such as Olaf from Frozen. Home video releases of Frozen were removed in Japan. Since then, Shunsuke Takeuchi became the new Japanese dub voice of Olaf.
