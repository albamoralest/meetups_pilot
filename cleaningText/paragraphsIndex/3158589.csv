"Porter, Steve Kleiber, (bass guitar) and John Calarco (drums) formed the three piece Willy Porter band. In 1994 Porter released the album Dog-Eared Dream, which had the successful single Angry Words. The single led to the Willy Porter Band touring as an opening act for artists including Tori Amos, Rickie Lee Jones, and The Cranberries. He signed with BMG/Private Music in 1995 and in 1999 with San Francisco-based label Six Degrees Records, for whom he released three albums. During that time, he toured with Sting, Paul Simon, and Jeff Beck. This was followed by touring with Jethro Tull and its guitarist Martin Barre.
