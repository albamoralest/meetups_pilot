"Gila Goldstein died of a stroke on 5 February 2017. Her death was announced, in some places, as the death of a ""male"" named ""Ilan Ronen"", which was the name on Goldstein's ID card. Friends said Goldstein invented the name for bureaucratic reasons. In response, Goldstein's great-nephew said that no government record could change the fact that Goldstein was always a woman, and the family promised that her grave would display the name ""Gila Goldstein"". The funeral was attended by actors, politicians, and representatives of the LGBT community.
