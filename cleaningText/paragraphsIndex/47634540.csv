"Darius was born in Virginia. He was raised in the Pentecostal faith; both his grandfathers were preachers in their own churches. He learned to play saxophone in the sixth grade; he played in church by the time he was 13. After attending college for several years in Richmond, Virginia, Jones moved to Brooklyn in 2005. Through a neighbor, Jones met artist Randal Wilcox and they became roommates. A conversation started between musician and painter that led to Jones's Man'ish Boy series. In 2009 signed with  AUM Fidelity, which released his debut album Man'ish Boy (A Raw and Beautiful Thing). He recorded with Matthew Shipp, the quartet Grass Roots, and the collective Little Women, a noise jazz band that explores the extremes of sound by using extended techniques and acoustic manipulation. Jones has worked in traditional jazz, electro-acoustic music, chamber ensembles, contemporary and avant-garde jazz groups, modern dance performances, and multi-media events.
