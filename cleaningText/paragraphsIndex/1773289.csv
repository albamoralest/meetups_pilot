"He was born in Oviedo, Asturias. He went to class with Formula One race car driver Fernando Alonso, to whom he dedicated the song ""Magic Alonso"". He also did racing for a while but he realized very quickly that he was not made for racing nor studying, but he was good at football. He played in the lower ranks of Astur CF, at the time a reserve team for Real Oviedo. Afterwards, he worked as a waiter in several bars and spent all night out, living experiences that would later go on to make up the lyrics of his songs. In 2001, he joined a group called ""El bosque de Sherwood"", and soon after recorded a demo with only three songs, ""Sin noticias de Holanda"", ""El informe del forense"", and ""Vuelvo a traficar"".
