"And now there is “Amor Y Traicion”.
",16,== Biography == | === Present ===
"The recent coronavirus pandemic has had numerous effects on Cabas. For Cabas, finding his bearings in these trying times has resulted in a new perspective and a major creative outburst, resulting in a series of singles and a new album coming out over the next 5 months. The start is Amor Y Traicion– written and produced with Grammy winning producer George Noriega and his team at the Cutting Cane studios in Miami; Mixed by Luis Barrera Jr. Mastered by – Francisco Holzmann. Amor Y Traicion and the accompanying highly original animated video created in Argentina by Federico and Nicolas Raiman, are Cabas’ clear-eyed perspective of these trying times and how we will come through the dark days similar to his own experience. Not your typical Latin music message and certainly worth a look. “AMOR Y TRAICION” was released on May 29, 2020. In 2021, Cabas released ""Divina"" an anthemn to the city of Bogotá, ""Trato Y No Consigo"", which speaks about the importance of family and includes a music video featuring his son, Simón, and ""Solos Ft.
