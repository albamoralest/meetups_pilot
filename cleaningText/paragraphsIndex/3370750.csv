"The sisters maintained an active social life and were the toast of many private parties in New York City until her death in 1976 when she suffered a massive stroke. Several good friends, including the photographer Edgar de Evia, arrived for dinner and she was reclined in their living room, her mind still clear, saying ""Oh, my dear boys, I believe that I've had a stroke."" She died that night, aged 72. Following services at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, she was cremated and interred with her mother in the mausoleum at Ferncliff Cemetery, Westchester County, New York.
