"The Military School of Music of the Army (Escuela Militar de Musica del Ejercito) was created by Supreme Decree on 20 May 1889 and it assumed the name of ""Tcnl. Adrián Patiño"" in 1951. It was the result of petitions from the ex-prisoners of the Chaco War. Khunuskiwa (Nevando Está) is a march that was made in honor of him. His musical productions from his military service continues to be used this day in civic and military parades. The most notable of these marches include the Presidential March and the Police Hymn.
