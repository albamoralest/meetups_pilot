"Miles Tackett is best known around the world as bassist/leader of Breakestra, a funk, soul-jazz band whose records & live shows are a throwback to the pre-sampling era of Bronx DJ performances. ""Music Man Miles"", as he is known among the underground DJ crowd, also helms the longest-running funky soul party in Los Angeles spinning an all-vinyl set. Tackett’s musical reputation extends well beyond the underground clubs of Los Angeles. He has performed and collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Blind Melon, B.B. King, Damien Marley, Little Feat, Macy Gray and legendary soul singer Syl Johnson. After years of focusing on a purist funk style and sound with Breakestra, Tackett has taken some time to write new songs using his first love, the electric guitar. Miles has released his most personal album yet, the soulful, guitar-centric The Fool Who Wonders. With an array of influences that draw from vintage soul, rhythm and blues, psychedelic, and blues/jazz influenced folk and rock, this album’s new vintage sound brings Tackett’s varied musical travels back to his roots.
