"In 2004, Tommy Karevik recorded a few songs with Vindictiv. Shortly after, he left the band for progressive metal band Seventh Wonder, prior to the release of their debut album Become in 2005.  Despite the warm reception of the album at the time of its release, the band members have stated that they were generally unhappy with the album due to its poor mixing. Once Karevik joined the band, they toured briefly to promote the album.
