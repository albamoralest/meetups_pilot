"After graduating from music school in 1990, she took an opportunity to visit Japan in 1991 and finally contracted with the ROAD&SKY Organization in 1993. She later participated in several projects with various artists in addition to the Radio Japan Series and being part of the chorus for the Kobe earthquake disaster charity single. She released eight solo albums, three mini-albums, two compilation albums and 3 singles. She gained popularity outside Japan with the release of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and the subsequent original soundtracks, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T. and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T. 2. These were written by long-time friend and composer Yoko Kanno, and both the first season's theme song, Inner Universe (featuring boy soprano Ben Del Maestro) and the second season's theme song, Rise, used Origa's vocals. Origa first performed with Kanno for ∀ Gundam, singing ""Moon"" in concerts (on the CD ""Moon"" is performed by Kanno under the pseudonym of Gabriela Robin; Kanno did not perform this song live until a surprise performance in 2009). In 2005, Origa performed songs for the anime series Fantastic Children, most notably the ending theme ""Mizu no Madoromi"". In 2006, Origa was involved in the lyrics and vocal performance for the opening song ""Player"" and the ending theme ""date of rebirth"" from the movie Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society. In 2007, Origa performed with Yoko Kanno for the Ragnarok 2 Concert. There, she performed all three Ghost in the Shell opening themes; ""Player"" from Solid State Society, ""Inner Universe"" from the first season, and ""Rise"" from  2nd GIG, and substituted for Ilaria Graziano on ""Yoru_Vo"", Pierre Bensusan on ""ELM"", and Gabriela Robin on ""Torukia"". She also performed alongside fellow vocalists Maaya Sakamoto and Mai Yamane and joined in singing selected songs originally performed only by Maaya. On December 19, 2008, she performed at Sugizo's ""Rise to Cosmic Dance"" concert held at Tokyo's Shibuya-AX hall. She later appeared on his 2011 single ""The Edge"".
