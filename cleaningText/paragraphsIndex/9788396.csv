"In October 2017, after 6 years of building the show into a global broadcast staple of the drum & bass genre (and a previous return to Mondays from 1 am to 3 am), the show made one final move to Tuesdays from 1 am to 3 am. Shortly thereafter, Friction announced he would 'pass the baton' to Canadian DJ/producer, Rene LaVice, who would take over as host of a new drum and bass show on 1Xtra in November 2017. In 2015, Friction created an alter-ego alias under the name FineArt which would step away from drum & bass and would concentrate more on bassline and house. His first release was a song titled ""Ruffneck"" which was released on Sony Music Entertainment. A few months later would be the release of another single, this was a collaboration on My Nu Leng's ""Horizons EP"" with a single titled ""Set It"". Later in 2015 another single called ""I Don't Wanna Rush"" which featured vocals from Rachel K Collier was released with a bunch of remixes. In 2017, FineArt & My Nu Leng announced the launch of their label called Maraki Records, the first release was from FineArt with an EP titled ""In Too Deep"" which featured collaborations with fellow record label owners My Nu Leng, and Taiki Nulight. In March 2016, he launched the label ""Elevate Records"". Its first release was Friction's Dare EP with the title track, Dare (Hold It Down) containing an interpolation of Gorillaz' 2005 song Dare.
