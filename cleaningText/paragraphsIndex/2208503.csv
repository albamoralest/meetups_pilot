"Strange formed Crowbar with Kirk Windstein (Down), Matt Thomas, and Craig Nunenmacher (Black Label Society). They released the best-selling albums of the band's discography, including the self-titled LP with the songs ""All I Had (I Gave)"", ""Existence is Punishment"", ""No Quarter"" (by Led Zeppelin), and ""I Have Failed"", produced by Phil Anselmo. By 1994, Anselmo put his band Pantera to the side and resurrected Down which was sidelined for Pantera in the late 1990s. The band released NOLA in reference to the band's hometown, New Orleans, Louisiana, and played 13 shows. Eventually, the album sold 500,000 copies and was certified Gold by the RIAA. Soon after, Anselmo returned to Pantera while Crowbar continued, and the two bands partnered up for tours in 1996. As a result, Strange, Windstein, and the rest of Crowbar appear in Pantera's ""Home Videos 3"" in the credits, and Windstein and the band are seen in scenes including the clip of Windstein dressed up as the Hulk. This event is also included in Crowbar's 1996 home video ""Like Broken"", but contains slightly different footage.
