"In 1987, he founded the pioneering Italian music label Minus Habens Records (involving artists such as Angelo Badalamenti, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin and Depeche Mode), through which he continues to explore and publish avant-garde and cutting-edge music. Several years later he established the Disturbance label to focus on ambient electronic and techno music. In the late 1980s, Iusco founded the dark ambient and industrial music group, Nightmare Lodge, whose music was primarily released through Minus Habens. During the 1990s, Iusco recorded works under the name ""It"" and released the first album under that name, Era Vulgaris, on his Disturbance imprint in 1996.
