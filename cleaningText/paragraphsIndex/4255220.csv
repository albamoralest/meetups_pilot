"She serves as a Cultural Ambassador for the National Autistic Society, performing concerts for the parents of autistic children. She calls this concert series ""Jamie's concerts"", after the severely autistic son of two musician friends with whom she lived in London and whom she supported as they learned to diagnose and then cope with the disorder, saying: ""I am not a doctor, I’m not a nurse, I’m not a teacher for someone with special needs, but I am a musician. What I realised is that I can do something – I can play concerts that give people like Jamie’s parents a break and an opportunity to meet other people who care for autistic children"".
