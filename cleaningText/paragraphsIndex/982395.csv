"In 1990, Airey recorded keyboard parts for several songs on Judas Priest's album Painkiller. However, because Judas Priest wanted the album to have a heavier sound than their previous work, only one song on Painkiller, ""A Touch of Evil"", prominently features Airey. In a 2020 interview, Airey revealed that he also played most of the album's bass parts on a Minimoog, as Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill was unable to participate in recording sessions due to illness. In 1997 he arranged and played on ""Love Shine a Light"" by Katrina and the Waves, conducting the accompanying orchestra at the Eurovision Song Contest. The song won the contest.

"Interviewed by Jeb Wright, for Classic Rock Revisited, about the album Now What?!, he said ""Well, it's Deep Purple and there is a Hammond there.  There is only one way to go, really.  Over the years, I have really worked on my sound, it didn't just happen overnight.  The first two, or three, years I was with the band, I was using Jon's C3 and it was pretty knackered.  I had it refurbished. It's been put in mothballs now... I much prefer Hammond A-100's, that's my choice.""

"Airey has employed many instruments and effect processors to aid him in the creation of his music and is well known for the use of his Hammond A100. In an interview with Keyboard Magazine Don Airey explained that he preferred the Hammond A-100 over other organs (including the Hammond B-3) for their ""purer tone"" in live settings.  He also uses Leslie 122 speakers and a Hughes and Kettner Puretone amplifier. For piano sounds, Airey uses a Kurzweil PC3K8 and also uses a MOOG Voyager. He also uses several rack and pedal based units such as a Roland Fantom. Airey is also an endorsing artist for several effects companies including Neunaber Audio and TC Electronic and currently uses a Neunaber Seraphim  Shimmer as well as a TC Hall of Fame Reverb and a TC Flashback Delay.
