"Steven ""Dobby"" Dawson (born 24 February 1952) is an English bass guitarist and a founder of Saxon. Dawson helped inspire This Is Spinal Tap. ""It was only a few years ago that the penny dropped about Harry Shearer,"" he observed in 2014, ""when he said he'd been on tour with Saxon and some of the character of Derek Smalls had been based on me â€“ pointing at the audience and all that malarkey. Harry's lovely... I'm proud to be an influence on Spinal Tap. They're taking the piss, but that's part of the game, isn't it?""
