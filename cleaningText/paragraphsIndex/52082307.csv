"Born in Bologna, Caroli was noted by the composer and conductor Giovanni Fenati while she was performing a song in a night club of her hometown. After studying singing, diction and acting, Caroli was entered into the Orchestra Fenati as vocalist, and with them she got a large success with the song ""Ehi, tu"" (1954), which subsequently launched her solo career. Caroli had the peak of her career between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when she participated to the most important Italian musical events of the time, including Canzonissima, Festival di Napoli and the tenth edition of the Sanremo Music Festival.
