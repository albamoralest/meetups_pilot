"Electra first drew national attention in 2010 with the music video ""I'm in Love with Friedrich Hayek"", which lauded the philosophy of the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and garnered commentary from the modern Austrian theory professor Steven Horwitz. In 2011, they released two more videos, ""Roll with the Flow"" and ""We Got it 4 Cheap"". Both were covered by mainstream political media. ""We Got it 4 Cheap"" came in second in the Lloyd V. Hackley Endowment's ""Supply and Demand Video Contest"". In 2012, they interned at production company Emergent Order.  Emergent Order had previously published ""Fear the Boom and Bust"", a similar Hayek-oriented rap video. Electra then produced a new, similarly economics-oriented pop video, ""FA$T CA$H"", with the support of an award from the Moving Picture Institute. In September 2012, Electra released the music video ""Party Milk"", which they describe as an attempt to merge common party scene symbolism with something one would never associate with a party, but that everyone is familiar with in another context. In 2014, Electra (as Dorian Electra & The Electrodes) released a music video called ""What Mary Didn't Know"", based on Frank Jackson's philosophical thought experiment of the same name (1986).2015 saw the release of Electra's video ""Forever Young: A Love Song to Ray Kurzweil"", a tribute to the futurist Ray Kurzweil.

"In 2016, Electra released ""Ode to the Clitoris"" on Refinery29 detailing the history of the clitoris from ancient Greece to modern 3D models. In an interview Electra stated it was to ""desensitize people to the word CLITORIS and help bring it more into popular consciousness."" In June 2016 Electra released ""Mind Body Problem"" on Bullett Media, a song and video ""about femininity as a performanceâ€”when being a 'woman' feels like putting on a costume and the costume doesn't seem to come off with the clothes"". Electra continued their music video series with Refinery29 about intersectional feminism and queer histories with ""The History of Vibrators"" (2016), the ""Dark History of High Heels"" (2016), ""2000 Years of Drag"" (2016), and ""Control"" (2017). These videos focused on the histories of intersectional feminist and queer issues, collaborating with many artists including Imp Queen, London Jade, The Vixen, Lucy Stoole, Eva Young, Zuri Marley, K Rizz, and Chynna. ""2000 Years of Drag"" was accepted and screened at The East Village Queer Film Festival, NewFest, Fringe! Queer Film & Arts Fest, TWIST: Seattle Queer Film Festival, Austin Gay & Lesbian International Film Festival (aGLIFF), Art All Night - Trenton: 6th Annual Film Festival, Desperado LGBT Film Festival, QUEER-Streifen Regensburg, Filmfest homochrom, Flatpack Film Festival, CINEMQ.

"In 2017, Electra released the single Jackpot through Grindr's digital publication Into More, a song that ""addresses gender fluidity, but in a more subtle, less explicitly educational way."" Later that year, Electra was featured on the Charli XCX track ""Femmebot"" with Mykki Blanco on the mixtape Pop 2. In 2018, Electra released three new tracks titled ""Career Boy"", ""VIP"", and ""Man to Man"". In 2019, Electra released their debut album, Flamboyant. In August 2019, Electra embarked on the Flamboyant: Chapter I tour, which lasted until November 2019. They began the second leg, Flamboyant: Chapter II, in early 2020. However, in March of the same year, the rest of the tour dates were postponed due to COVID-19.
