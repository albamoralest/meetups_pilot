"As a teenager in 1959, Babbitt joined the Ventures rock group, just before the band gained fame with their huge hit ""Walk Don't Run"" in 1960. Babbitt had to drop out because he was not old enough to play the nightclubs and bars the band was beginning to work in. Babbitt was commissioned in 1965 through the Reserve Officer Training Corps program at the University of Washington. He trained as an aircraft maintenance officer and served as officer in charge of fighter flight lines in the United States, the Pacific and Europe. He twice commanded aircraft maintenance squadrons and was deputy commander for maintenance of a European F-15 wing.
