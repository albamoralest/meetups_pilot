"Phillips was born to a Reform Jewish family in Santa Barbara, California, United States. Although his family was Jewish, with Glen having a Bar Mitzvah, his family was secular and Buddhism was studied, with this spiritual curiosity being present in his work. He began to make music at 14 years old. Phillips and his ex-wife, Laurel, have three daughters, Sophia, Freya, and Zola. The couple was married from 1989 to 2014. On October 8, 2008, Phillips injured his arm while at a friend's house when a glass coffee table collapsed while he was sitting on it. Phillips had surgery to repair a damaged ulnar nerve and muscle in his left arm. His ability to play guitar was hampered during his recovery, but he had been actively touring in spite of his injury. Sean Watkins and Jonathan Kingham recently joined Phillips on the road to provide accompaniment. Phillips is frequently barefoot when performing with the band.

"During his time in Toad the Wet Sprocket, Phillips was involved in a pop rock project called Flapping, Flapping. Three years after Toad the Wet Sprocket's initial breakup, Phillips released his first solo album, Abulum, which was a change from the sound that characterized Toad the Wet Sprocket's material. This was followed up by a self-released live album and solo touring, along with a reunion tour with his former Toad bandmates.

"In 2005, Phillips returned to a major label via Universal Records' imprint Lost Highway Records and released the critically acclaimed Winter Pays For Summer.  The album included the radio single ""Duck and Cover,"" but Phillips and the label would part ways due to creative differences.
