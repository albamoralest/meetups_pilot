"In early 1965, Winston, along with his acquaintance Steve Marriott, formed Small Faces with Ronnie Lane and Kenney Jones. While originally a guitarist, his role was soon shifted to become a keyboardist. Winston was fundamental in the band's emergence, as his parents owned the Ruskin Arms pub located in Manor Park, a place where the group would rehearse and occasionally perform. After a performance at the Cavern Club on Leicester Square, an assistant of manager Don Arden stepped up to the band and managed to secure them a contract with Decca Records. The band released their debut single ""Whatcha Gonna Do About It"" later that year, peaking at number 14. The success of this single would be followed by ""I've Got Mine"", which despite good reviews failed to chart. The group including Winston performed the song in Dateline Diamonds (1965). Shortly after this release, Winston left the group, and was promptly replaced by Ian McLagan.

"Our original organist, Jimmy Winston, wasn't working out. He couldn't play – I mean, none of us could play, but we was keen. Jimmy Winston couldn't play, and on top of it he had an ego as if he could play the piano, so he had to go! We chucked him out of the Small Faces. Very exciting times, the Sixties, there'll never be another time like it, I'm sure. However, Kenney Jones later said: ""He [Winston] got above his station and tried to compete with Steve Marriott.""
