"Their first official release was a split album with Metal Duck. Lawnmower Deth's side of the record was entitled Mower Liberation Front and positive responses led to their debut studio album, Ooh Crikey, It’s… Lawnmower Deth. Their second studio album, Return of the Fabulous Metal Bozo Clowns, was released in 1992. For this release, Paddy was replaced by Kev Papworth. The band covered several famous songs in their time, including Fleetwood Mac's ""The Chain"", Motörhead's self-titled song, Squeeze's ""Up the Junction"", The Osmonds' ""Crazy Horses"", and Kim Wilde's ""Kids in America"" which was released as the band's only single in 1991. The band's sense of humour extended into their music videos. Both ""Kids in America"" and ""Lawnmowers for Heroes, Comics for Zeros"", the latter from Metal Bozo Clowns, were recorded on home video cameras and edited in an amateur fashion.
