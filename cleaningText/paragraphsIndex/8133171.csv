"Sean Bergin (29 June 1948 – 1 September 2012) was an avant-garde jazz saxophonist and flautist from South Africa. Bergin was born in Durban on 29 June 1948. He was a saxophonist, flautist, composer, educator and bandleader. In his youth Bergin was influenced by the rich South African jazz. During apartheid, he performed illegally with black musicians. He is one of the expatriates of South African jazz to find success elsewhere. From 1976 he lived in Amsterdam. In addition to his M.O.B. (""My Own Band"") project, Bergin was active in Trio San Francisco (a saxophone trio with Tobias Delius and Daniele D'Agaro), the Bug Band (with Paul Stocker), and in several Tristan Honsinger formations. He worked with Mal Waldron, Louis Moholo, Ernst Reijseger, Boi Akih, and Miriam Makeba. He won the VPRO/Boy Edgar Award in 2000.
