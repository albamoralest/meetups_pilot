"In the late seventies Björkk became aware of music recorded by bands such as Kiss. After this he began buying music on a regular basis, staying true to the metal scene throughout his early teens. His taste and thoughts changed when he heard the German band Kraftwerk with their electronic sound and cold drum rhythms. When he was 16 he bought a Roland SH-101 synthesiser and began working on music inspired by bands such as DAF and Front 242. This led to Björkk recording with friends producing what would later be the band Pouppée Fabrikk.
