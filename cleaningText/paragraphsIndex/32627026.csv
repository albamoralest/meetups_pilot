Blaine's father, Henry William Cope Harrison, is a former architect and designer. Blaine's mother, Helen Harrison, is a former math teacher and lives in the southwest of France. He also has a sister Dymphna Harrison, a designer.

"Blaine cites his inability to speak French during the years he spent in France as an important influence on his creativity: ""At the time I found it quite difficult being so out of the loop, but looking back, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. It taught me to use my imagination. I made music because I couldn't speak the language.

"Blaine's personal life has affected the band's sound a lot; Blaine has cited his turbulent relationship with his first girlfriend as the inspiration behind songs such as ""Flakes"" and ""Behind the Bunhouse"" on the album Twenty One. Blaine also has a close relationship with his father, Henry, who introduced him to music as a child and supported his musical career, despite his physical obstacles. Blaine has said his father's role is more like an older brother's protectiveness and that there would be no Mystery Jets without him. Henry was named ""18th coolest person in rock"" by NME in 2005.

"Blaine was born with the disability spina bifida, which has affected his leg muscles since he was a child. In 2009 he became a patron of the Attitude is Everything Charity, who work with live music venues in the UK to make gigs accessible for people with disabilities. Blaine was quoted in an interview with the BBC saying, ""When we first got together as a band we decided that we wouldn't make my disability an issue, the same way we didn't make a big deal of my dad being in the band. We weren't interested in gimmicks... We wanted people to read our lyrics and listen to our music."" Blaine has said playing live as someone with a physical impairment is sometimes hard work, seeing as many modern facilities still do not have the means to cater for disabled people. He has made it clear that Mystery Jets will only play in venues who have made an effort to cater for people with disabilities and refrain from playing in small, crowded pubs.

In September 2019 the band were forced to postpone the imminent release of their new album and their tour, when Blaine was again hospitalised.
