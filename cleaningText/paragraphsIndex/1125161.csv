"Jo-Anne Bench is a death metal bass player from Leamington Spa, England, who is best known as the bassist for Bolt Thrower. She has performed on all of the band's albums, but not on any of their demos. Bench joined the band in 1987, shortly after Gavin Ward switched from bass guitar to guitar. At the time, she was Ward's long-time girlfriend and one of the few women playing in a death metal band. Bolt Thrower were active until 2016, when they decided to disband following the death of drummer Martin Kearns the previous year.
