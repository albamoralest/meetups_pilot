"Will Hoge was born and grew up in Franklin, Tennessee, located just south of Nashville.  His sound was influenced by his musician father and uncles and the extensive record collection that his father kept.
",2,== Early life ==
"Hoge attended Western Kentucky University to study history, planning to become a high school history teacher and basketball coach.  He decided that he wanted to try his hand at rock and roll and began writing music.  Will left the university after realizing he wanted to be a musician.

"With former The Georgia Satellites guitarist Dan Baird in tow, Hoge began touring the American south.  He independently released his first CD, Live At The Exit/In, a live set recorded at the Nashville club.  His original sound drew much attention and, through constant touring, he was able to release his first studio album, Carousel.
",7,== Solo artist ==
"Hoge caught the attention of Atlantic Records music executives and he was signed to a record deal in early 2002.  Atlantic then re-released Carousel to a wider market.  His 2003 major label debut, Blackbird On A Lonely Wire was a cleaner sounding effort; however, the album was poorly promoted by Atlantic.  Eventually, Hoge asked for and received a release from his contract, re-obtaining the rights to Carousel.

"The support of his fans has given Hoge the ability to tour incessantly, and self-release a couple live albums (2004's Almost Alone: Live At Smith's Olde Bar' and 2005's During the Before and After), a politically charged album called The America EP (which included a cover of Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin')"", and a bluesy rock and roll sounding album, The Man Who Killed Love.
",9,== Solo artist ==
"Over the years, Hoge has toured with many artists, including Midnight Oil, Shinedown, Needtobreathe, Marc Broussard, ZZ Top, The Cat Empire, Squeeze, Jason Isbell, Lisa Loeb and Edwin McCain.  Bands that have opened for him include Steel Train, The Trews, The Elms, Rose Hill Drive, Needtobreathe, Moses Mayfield, The Alternate Routes, Aslyn, Katie Herzig, Missy Higgins, and The Civil Wars.

"The band's fourth studio album, Draw the Curtains, was released nationwide in October 2007 by Rykodisc Records. The album was initially released as a CD, with a limited edition 180-Gram Vinyl Record version which followed later.

"Following a scooter accident in August 2008, the band went on hiatus for seven months while Hoge recuperated from his injuries.  In April 2009, the band got together for a 3-week acoustic tour of venues in the Midwest, Southeast and East Coast, hitting cities including New York City, Chicago, Nashville and Atlanta.  When the tour ended in late April, the band headed back into the studio to complete recording their next album (of which they had begun at the time of Hoge's accident).  Ken Coomer and Charlie Brocco again produced, and the album, The Wreckage, was released on September 29, 2009.

During this time, Hoge was invited to perform on three separate occasions at the Grand Ole Opry, with country legend Vince Gill playing guitar and singing background vocals on a couple songs during his first appearance (Gill is a guest artist on 'Seven' as well, as he and his wife, Amy Grant are fans of Hoge).

"== Motorcycle accident ==
",26,== Motorcycle accident ==
"Hoge was involved in a motorcycle accident on August 20, 2008 after leaving a studio session for what would be his next album, ""The Wreckage."" He was traveling north on Main Street in East Nashville at about 8 p.m. when a van traveling southbound failed to yield while turning into 712 Main St.  Hoge's motorcycle collided with the passenger side of the van. He was admitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in critical condition.  He went into surgery immediately upon arrival at the hospital for numerous broken bones (ribs, sternum, shattered femur, knee cap, shoulder blades), and lacerations to his face, arms, and torso requiring over 200 stitches.  Hoge's condition was upgraded to stable on August 22.  No evidence was found that alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident. In the year following the accident, Hoge went through numerous surgical procedures (mainly on his shattered femur/leg) and intensive physical therapy.  Work on The Wreckage, as well as tour dates, were postponed through spring 2009.  Since that point, Hoge has made a full recovery.
