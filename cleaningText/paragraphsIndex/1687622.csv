"Teebee's music is characterised by a strong dark and futuristic science fiction influence. TeeBee material could be classed as neurofunk or techstep, although possessing a deeper ambient and atmospheric quality than much of this subgenre. His early work in particular owes an acknowledged stylistic debt to Photek, and he was initially mostly associated with the Certificate 18 record label, alongside Photek, Klute and fellow Norwegian Polar.  Following the folding of Cert 18 to enable the owner to release other genres of music, he, along with Polar, created the label Subtitles.

"Teebee moved on to incorporate eclectic/experimental sounds into his music, mixing diverse samples into his tunes, such as China's Wong Fei Hung theme, ""On the General's Orders"".  Working with UK producer Calyx, the duo have finished their first album entitled ""Anatomy"" on the newly formed label ""Momentum Music"". Tracks from this album have been smashed globally and include ""Telepathy"" and ""Warrior"".
