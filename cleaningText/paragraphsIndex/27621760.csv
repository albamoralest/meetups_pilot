A few days before the official release, the album was streamed in full at several websites. Described as a unification of punk and Americana by Rolling Stone, the record embraced a more optimistic outlook, influenced by falling in love again, moving from Philadelphia to California and the new musical collaboration between Dave and his brother Tim Hause. Until then Dave Hause had performed his solo material solo or as a duo but for the Bury Me In Philly tour he put together a band, The Mermaid, composed of Dave on vocals and guitar, Dave´s brother Tim Hause on lead guitar, Miles Bentley (Jay Bentley´s son) on bass, Kevin Conroy on drums and Kayleigh Goldsworthy on keyboard. They toured American and Europe in this configuration; their first show in Cologne on March 1, 2017 was recorded for the German TV show Rockpalast (video).
