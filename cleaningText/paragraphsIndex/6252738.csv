"John Robert ""Johnny Hammond"" Smith (December 16, 1933 â€“ June 4, 1997) was an American soul jazz and hard bop organist.

"After a 10-year spell on Prestige Records throughout the 1960s resulting in a series of albums, he signed for soul/R&B influenced Kudu imprint of Creed Taylor's  well-regarded CTI Records jazz record label in 1971. His first album for Taylor, Break Out was chosen that year to launch Kudu. The album featured Grover Washington Jr. as a sideman prior to the launch of his career as a solo recording artist. Three further albums followed with Taylor on Kudu, as he decided to refer to himself as ""Johnny Hammond"", after deciding to drop ""Smith"" from his name.
