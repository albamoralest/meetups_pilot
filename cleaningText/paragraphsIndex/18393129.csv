"In 1995, Pest was approached by Infernus of Gorgoroth with an offer to join the band as their new vocalist, after the previous vocalist Hat had decided to leave the band. Pest performed his first concert with Gorgoroth in December 1995, supporting Cradle of Filth at the London Astoria, and provided the vocals for the song ""Possessed (by Satan)"" on the band's second album, Antichrist, released in 1996. Gorgoroth went on a European tour with Satyricon and Dissection in April 1996, followed by one-off gigs in Bergen, Norway and in Bischofswerda, Germany. Pest provided all the vocals on Gorgoroth's third full-length album, Under the Sign of Hell, which was recorded in spring 1996 and released in 1997. Obtained Enslavement, with Pest still on vocals, released their second full-length album, Witchcraft, the same year. Gorgoroth went on their first headlining European tour in fall 1997, after which Pest decided to leave the band to concentrate on his work in Obtained Enslavement. He did, however, contribute lyrics and vocals to several tracks on Gorgoroth's 1998 album, Destroyer.
