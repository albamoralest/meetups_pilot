"From 1945, the leader and organizer Ragnvald Sexe was central to the expansion to a 12-piece orchestra. After a period of hibernation, there was a new impetus in 1958, with the conductor Jostein Gjersvik. Later Asbjørn Krokstad (trombone) and drummer Bonsak Schieldrop (1959–64) developed the band to a 17-man crew after model of Count Basie. They were considered one of the four to five key big band with jazz standards as repertoire in Norway.

"Around 1971, Per Husby (piano and arranger) took charge of Bodega Band, and was central to a change of course with a greater element of his own music, assisted by performers and writers like Lars Martin Thomassen (flugelhorn), Eirik Lie/Tor Halmrast (guitar), Torgeir Døssland (alto saxophone and clarinet) and Jan Tro (bass). A highlight was the visit in 1972 by musical instructor Clark Terry.
