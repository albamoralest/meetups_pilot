"In 1962, Rivera moved to New York City. The following year, he joined the band New Jersey Swing Combo. He also sang in Mike Hernández's band, where he was given the nickname ""Chamaco"" as Rivera was the youngest member of the band. In 1970, Rivera began performing with Willie Rosario's band and was featured in his album De Donde Nace el Ritmo, in which he recorded his well-known hit ""La Vida"". He also recorded a second album, Mas Ritmo, with Rosario in 1972. Rivera was also one of the featured artists in Rafael Cortijo's 1974 album, Con las Siete Potencias. In 1974, Rivera formed his own band and recorded his first solo album, Chamaco. Various solo recordings followed, including Mi Chamaco (1976), El Juicio (1978), Canción, Hombre y Pueblo (1980), and Chamaco Para Buen Rato (1981). Rivera's 1984 album Por Fin features the song ""Consuelo"", a duet recorded alongside José Feliciano. In 1987, Rivera returned to collaborate with Willie Rosario for a live concert in Cali, Colombia. Rivera continued to record songs and produce new albums well into the 1990s. In 1994, he wrote and recorded the song ""Contestame Dios Mio"" (a tribute song to fellow singer Hector Lavoe, who died the previous year) for his album Aqui Estoy.
