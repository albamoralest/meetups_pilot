"Chet Atkins signed Terry as a solo artist for RCA Records in the early 1980s, charting at number 85 on Hot Country Songs with ""Love Is a Full Time Thing"". He returned to being a session musician, appearing live with, and on numerous albums for, artists including Ray Charles, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Don Williams, Garth Brooks, George Jones, Hank Williams Jr., Merle Haggard, Reba McEntire, Randy Travis, Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Roy Orbison, Kenny Chesney, Emmylou Harris, Neil Young, Waylon Jennings, Brooks & Dunn, J. J. Cale, Trisha Yearwood, Amy Grant and many others. In 1993, he played at President Bill Clinton's inaugural ball, with David Pack’s (Ambrosia) All Star Band, giving a solo harmonica performance of ""Amazing Grace"". He recorded an album for Step One Records in 1993, with Nashville's Christ Church Choir. McMillan became one of country music's most popular session and in demand musicians on harmonica and percussion of all time. After his family's house was destroyed in a 1992 house fire, McMillan became a devout Christian and focused extensively on inspirational music. In 1993, he released his first album, I've Got a Feeling, on Step One Records. He also released an album for Giant Records, Somebody's Comin' in 1997. In the years that followed, he became a frequent guest on Christian television programs.
