"G-Wiz, like many East Coast hip hop producers, began as a DJ spinning at basement parties and small clubs in Long Island, Queens and New York City in the mid 1980s.
",2,== Biography ==
"He made the transition to record producer in the early 1990s, when he handed fellow Long Islander Chuck D a tape full of beats. The hip hop production team, The Bomb Squad, had silently gone their separate ways after Fear of a Black Planet (1990) and no new Public Enemy album was imminent. After hearing G-Wiz’s music, Chuck D immediately planned to do an EP with G-Wiz being the sole producer. The two had such chemistry, the original eight cuts soon turned into 12 and Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black was born. Apocalypse 91: The Enemy Strikes Black, as of 2007, is Public Enemy's greatest selling album to date, selling close to two million copies, and spawning the hits ""Can't Truss It"" and ""Shut Em Down.""
