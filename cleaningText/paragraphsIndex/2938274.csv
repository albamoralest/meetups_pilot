"Burlap to Cashmere was formed in the winter of 1994 by cousins John Philippidis and Steven Delopoulos. The troupe was originally a college theater show that Steven Delopoulos put together for his final exam at Marymount Manhattan College, a theater and dance college which Delopoulos attended.  He later asked his then 14-year-old cousin Johnny to join him in the show, and the band was formed. Members Mike Ernest (guitar) and childhood friend Theodore Pagano (drums) followed.

"In 1995 Jamison Ernest managed the band and arranged for them to play at The Bitter End on a regular basis.

"In 1998 Burlap to Cashmere signed with A&M Records and released the full-length recording Anybody Out There?  followed by an A&M re-release of Live at the Bitter End, but the constant touring ""caused Burlap to burn bright and then burn out.""In 2005, a new Burlap to Cashmere demo album was recorded. The demo was never released. While returning home from the studio, John Philippidis was nearly beaten to death in an altercation that took place subsequent to a minor motor vehicle accident.

"On July 19, 2011, Burlap to Cashmere released their first full-length album in 13 years, the self-titled Burlap to Cashmere. In 2012, the band was recruited by director Brett Leonard to be the launch artist for his musical cinema concept ""PopFictionLife"". The resulting full-length feature The Other Country - Starring Burlap to Cashmere was shot on the road during one of the band's tours, with subsequent filming done around Los Angeles. The movie tells the story of the band's history, along with live concert footage and recordings. The film also stars Samantha Lockwood and America's Next Top Model winner Nicole Fox. In 2015, the band released their third album, Freedom Souls, as a digital-only release.
