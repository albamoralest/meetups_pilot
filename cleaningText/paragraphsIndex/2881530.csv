"Sheryn was born in Carcar, Cebu, to Bernardo and Daisy Regis. She is the eldest of three children, with brothers Elton and Joseph. Sheryn's mother guided her in singing, and at the age of two, she was able to hum and sing simple tunes. Her first and favorite contest piece was Kuh Ledesma's ""Dito Ba?"" (""Is it Here?"") which she learned at age 5. At seven, Regis started joining amateur singing contests. Her winnings were used to buy Shirley Bassey's cassette tapes for her next contest piece. She won her first grand prize at age 8 after singing Tillie Moreno's ""Saan Ako Nagkamali"" (""Where Did I Go Wrong"").
",3,== Early and personal life ==
"Aside from singing in contests, Sheryn earned income by offering voice lessons to children while in high school. She finished her B.S. Secondary Education degree with a major in English at Cebu Normal University. It was during her college years that she was exposed to theater acting and chorale singing which eventually gave her the chance to travel and perform for Filipino communities in Canada and in the USA. Veteran actors Leo Martinez and Gina Alajar served as her workshop mentors. In 1999, she was awarded ""Best Interpreter"" at the Cebu Metro Pop Music Festival (a songwriting festival), when she sang ""Among Gabayan"" (Our Guide), a Cebuano tribute song to Cebu's patron Sto. Niño written by Fr. Jed Ponce Billones. Their entry was also hailed as the Grand Prize winner. Sheryn worked as a lounge singer at the Cebu Plaza Hotel where she met Earl Echiverri (cousin of Caloocan mayor Enrico Echiverri). They married in 2002 and had their first child Lourdes the following year. Regis came out as a lesbian in 2021, revealing her relationship with her partner Mel De Guia on social media.

"In 2003, Regis secured a place as grand finalist in ABS-CBN’s television reality singing competition Star in a Million after advancing from the elimination rounds with Teresa Garcia. Dubbed as the ""Power Belter"" because of her effortless high notes, Regis was a judge favorite and was the only finalist to never place in the bottom two during the entire season. She placed consistently in the top performances every week, eventually reaching the Grand Champion Night on January 3, 2004, with Marinel Santos and Erik Santos. Regis won the Texter's Choice Award but placed only as a runner-up after singing Wendy Moten's Come in Out of the Rain. Disheartened by not winning the 1-million peso and house and lot prizes, Regis returned to Cebu thinking she would have to start over again, but was instead offered a recording contract with Star Records and released a recording of Come in Out of the Rain, which became an instant hit and Regis' signature song.
