"Ilza Nogueira was born in Salvador, Bahia. She studied composition under Ernst Widmer at the School of Music and Performing Arts of the Federal University of Bahia. After graduation in 1972, she won a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and continued her studies in composition at the Academy of Music in Cologne (1974–1977) with Mauricio Kagel. She also obtained Master of Arts (1983) and Doctor of Philosophy (1985) degrees from the State University of New York at Buffalo (USA), where she studied under Lejaren Hiller and Morton Feldman.

Her works have been included in all recognized venues of contemporary music in Brazil, such as the Biennial of Contemporary Brazilian Music, Encounters of Latin American Composers and Performers, International Encounters of Female Composers, Panorama of Brazilian Music Now and the Festival Virtuosi.
