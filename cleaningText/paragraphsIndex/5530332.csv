"McCarty is respected for the innovative drumming styles which he introduced into rock music, particularly psychedelic music during the 1960s. In Yardbirds tracks such as ""Train Kept A-Rollin'"" McCarty produces a train style beat, and tracks like ""Mister You’re a Better Man Than I"" and ""Shapes of Things""  he changes tempo mid song as well as produces a martial beat, such as the fast military gallop which drives the Shapes of Things solo. ""I'm A Man"" has what became known as a speed metal beat, ""I'm Not Talking"" has the strong back beat. Although not as flamboyant as his contemporaries Keith Moon and Mitch Mitchell, McCarty’s drumming influenced others to play styles other than early rock 'n' roll, and he is especially recognized for his early career innovations, many of which received extensive American and European airplay, such as ""Happenings Ten Years Time Ago"" (a psychedelic rock highlight).
