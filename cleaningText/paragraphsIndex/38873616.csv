"Jetty Rae was born in Springfield, Oregon on January 13, 1987. She was raised by her parents, Tyvin and Kathleen, in an art-friendly family near the mountain town of Happy Camp, California before moving for a short time to Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her parents were missionaries which required them to move often before finally settling down in Charlevoix, Michigan where Jetty Rae attended Charlevoix High School. Jetty's mother started a theater group, called the Ragamuffins, in which Jetty held many roles. Rae was initially introduced to songwriting through her affinity for poetry. Following her graduation from high school she tried out for Juilliard but was not accepted. Jetty Rae eventually decided to attend the Youth With a Mission (YWAM) discipleship training school in Kona, Hawaii where she partook in 3 mission trips over two years to China, Fiji, and Australia. After graduating in 2008, Jetty Rae returned to Michigan where she met her husband, Jason Stewart (to whom she now refers as her ""husband-ger""). The two initially met on Facebook and were married at the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the Riviera Maya outside Cancun, Mexico on December 21, 2008. If not for music, Jetty has stated her interest for both cooking and makeup, citing them as art forms themselves. Jetty Rae has a pug named Otis a son named Beck and two daughters, one named Rowin and another named Jude. She also had a daughter, Ella, who was stillborn; she keeps a blog entitled ""The Singing Hitchhiker"" about her. In May 2016 Jetty Rae and her family moved into an Airstream, which they renovated after purchasing it on Craigslist for $3,000.00, and began living a minimal lifestyle. In a 2019 interview, Rae revealed that after 3 years on the road she intends to settle down in a conventional house.
