"Born Agatha Nathalia Weston in Detroit, Michigan, United States, she was signed to Motown in 1961, scoring a minor hit with ""Love Me All the Way"" (R&B No. 24, Pop #88). Weston's biggest solo hits with Motown were ""Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)"" (R&B No. 4, Pop No. 50, 1965, later covered by the Isley Brothers, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Jermaine Jackson , the Doobie Brothers and Phil Collins), and ""Helpless"" (R&B No. 13, Pop No. 56, entered Cashbox March 26, 1966, previously recorded by The Four Tops on their Second Album LP). Her biggest claim to fame was singing the classic hit ""It Takes Two"" with Marvin Gaye in 1966, and her later recording of the Black National Anthem, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"". It was the success of ""It Takes Two"" that caused Motown to partner Gaye with Tammi Terrell, spawning even more success for the label.

"Weston left Motown in 1967, and later sued the label over disputes about royalties. She and her then-husband William ""Mickey"" Stevenson (former A&R head at Motown) both went to MGM Records. Weston cut a couple of singles for MGM, ""I Got What You Need,"" and ""Nobody,"" which went largely unnoticed due to lack of airplay and promotion. She made an album for the label, This Is America, which included her popular version of the Black National Anthem, ""Lift Every Voice and Sing"". This was released as a single and featured in the movie, Wattstax. All the money from the single was donated to the United Negro College Fund.
