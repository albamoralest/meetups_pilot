"Marsh is a graduate of Full Sail University's Recording Arts program. He started his career in Atlanta working at Jermaine Dupri's ""Southside Studios"" for So So Def Recordings where he worked with Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Nelly and Bryan-Michael Cox.  While at Southside Studios, Marsh met Dallas Austin's engineer/programmer, Rick Sheppard and was hired to work at Dallas' DARP Studios. Marsh worked at DARP as an assistant to Dallas and Sheppard, engineering recordings for Natalie Cole, George Clinton, Joss Stone, Sugababes and Lionel Richie. Marsh steadily became in very heavy demand as more people became aware of his amazing talents as an engineer. He has engineered, produced and given his multi-instrumentalist talents to a very long list of well known megastars including Asher Roth, Fantasia, Leona Lewis, Estelle, Nas, Travie McCoy, The Constellations, Plies, Ciara, Amerie, Juvenile, Ludacris, ""Rick Ross"", Common, Novel, Kelis, Kid Cudi, Chase & Status, The Teddybears, and Bruno Mars. In recognition of his engineering talents Marsh was nominated for ""Outstanding Creative Achievement"" at the 27th annual TEC Awards. Marsh met CeeLo Green at one of his freelancing jobs which proved to be a Grammy winning union. Marsh and CeeLo Green formed the production team The Grey Area to work on music that would be mainstream hits.  He collaborated on Gnarls Barkley's The Odd Couple and CeeLo's 2010 multi-platinum smash ""Fuck You"" from The Lady Killer album. The result of this collaboration was Graham receiving two Grammy nominations, with one win for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the song ""Fuck You"". Marsh met Amber Renee in summer of 2013, and the pair started writing songs together under the name CLAWS (eventually changed to CLAVVS). They released their first singles in 2015. CLAVVS' music has been featured on the CW's Charmed and MTV's Teen Wolf. They have earned praise from NPR, The Line of Best Fit, and Consequence of Sound, among others.
