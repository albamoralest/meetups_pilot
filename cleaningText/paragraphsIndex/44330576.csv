"Grace Petrie began performing in 2006 as a solo vocalist and acoustic guitarist, and self-released an eponymous album that year, followed in 2007 by second album Feeling Better. In 2010, the advent of the Conservative-led coalition government following the (UK) general election influenced Petrie, who is a socialist, feminist, and lesbian, towards an increasing emphasis on politically focused songwriting, from a left-wing perspective. She made her debut appearance on Glastonbury's Leftfield stage at the invitation of Billy Bragg in summer 2010, and widely praised third album Tell Me A Story followed, including signature song ""Farewell to Welfare"". In 2011, Petrie toured with comedian Josie Long. Fourth album Mark My Words followed, including the song ""Emily Davison Blues"" â€“ a comment on media reaction to the 2011 riots. A special film directed by Chris Shepherd for the song ""Rise"" from the same album was screened on Channel 4 as part of the TV series Random Acts. In 2012, Petrie took part in the ""Anti-Capitalist Roadshow"" alongside Roy Bailey, Robb Johnson, Leon Rosselson, Peggy Seeger and others. She has also performed gigs with other political folk artists such as Chris T-T, David Rovics and Dick Gaughan, as well as political indie/punk rock bands like Thee Faction and Colour Me Wednesday.
