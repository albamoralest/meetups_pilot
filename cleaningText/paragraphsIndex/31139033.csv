"Thomas was based in Kent, Washington, where he built guitars apparently uninfluenced by any other guitar builder. It included a cross-shaped guitar (called the Maltese), a triangular one (the Mandarin), and ""the deranged mutations of the Mod and the Riot King."" Thomas custom-built guitars as well, both electric and acoustic, including a number of enormous hollow-body guitars.
