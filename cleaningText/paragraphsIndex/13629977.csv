"Anthony Hooper (14 September 1939 â€“ 18 November 2020) was an English singer-songwriter and musician. He was best known as a founder-member of Strawbs together with Dave Cousins and double bassist Ron Chesterman. He left The Strawbs in 1972 after their album Grave New World, when it became obvious that the band was moving further away from its folk roots towards rock and progressive rock. He rejoined for a 10-year stint in 1983. Hooper had been the guitarist in the Ceilidh and barn dance band, Pitchfork, since 1986, and was also a member of Misalliance.
