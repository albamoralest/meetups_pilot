"He was born in Delhi in 1946 and started as a stage singer in the 1960s in Karachi, when he was a member of a famous singing group with two other artists, Masood Rana and Nadeem. Akhlaq Ahmad was the third generation of  male playback singers in the Pakistan film industry. He struggled for many years, but gained some recognition in the 1970s as a playback singer. ""Sona Na Chandi Na Koi Mahal"" film song in film Bandish (1980), and ""Sawan Aye Sawan Jaye"" in film Chahat (1974), are his big hit film songs. Both of these film songs were composed by music director Robin Ghosh. His song tally is under one hundred songs. Famous Indian singer Sonu Nigam sang many songs of Akhlaq Ahmed as Sonu's voice closely resembles with Akhlaq's and released these songs in late 1990s. Earlier Akhlaq Ahmed had first started singing for friends at gathering just for fun. Then he was a member of a famous singing group from Karachi with two other artists, film playback singer Masood Rana and film actor Nadeem. At first, he started singing as a stage singer in the 1960s. Akhlaq Ahmed debuted as a film singer in the 1973 film, Pazaib with music by Lal Mohammad Iqbal. He was unable to get a dominant place in the Pakistan film industry because when he started his singing career, at that time Ahmed Rushdi was the prominent playback singer in the Pakistani film industry. Despite that, he remained a somewhat successful singer in the late 1970s and 1980s due to his singing talent.
