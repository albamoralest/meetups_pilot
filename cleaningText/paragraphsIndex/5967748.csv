She also recorded an Inca mantra, Inti, a Pre-Columbian hymn to the sun. This album was partly recorded in Paris, partly in Montreal, where she spends much of her time. Krieger sings in French as well as in her mother tongue Portuguese, and Spanish. She creates mixes between bossanova or samba rhythms and French language, pop flavours sung in South American style, and some very Brazilian or afro-Brazilian songs. Her album Carmin has been produced by Robson Galdino, a carioca guitar player living in Paris, and Erik West Millette, a bass, guitar and slides player from Montreal.
