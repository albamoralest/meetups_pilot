"In July 2013 Collin McLoughlin announced an entirely new self-produced melodic dubstep EP, Tears Of Tempo. Starting July 16, he promised to release one track a week every Tuesday.  The first song released was titled ""Chasing Ghosts,"" and was released with a YouTube video.  The third single off of the EP ""One Desire,"" was also released with a music video.  The EP has thus far been met with widespread blog support, and has been featured on high traffic blogs and websites including Dubstep. NET (on which Chasing Ghosts hit the #1 ranking the week it was released). Barstool U and IntoTheAM,In an interview with FreshNewTracks.com, Collin addressed the initial response his Tears Of Tempo EP received He said, ""When I released my debut Tears Of Tempo EP online, people thought I had a ghost producer making my material, since I had never shown aptitude producing anything beyond super raw acoustic covers previously. On top of that the fact that I was on The Voice has made it even harder for me to break that stigma of just being a singer, but I think now that I'm showing people what I'm made of the stigma is starting to change. At this point singing is a tool in my arsenal, it isn't my defining characteristic any longer. Production for me became a way to extend my artistic vision beyond pure words and vocal melody, it allows me to create entire sonic landscapes that house the words I sing or remix.""

"McLoughlin has also grown to significant prominence in the world of underground electronic dance music, especially the melodic dubstep genre. He's regarded as ""one of the absolute kings in the realm of melodically driven and euphorically inspired dubstep."" In addition, he has provided vocals for songs well known in the EDM world, such as ""Heartbeat"" by the Dutch house duo Vicetone, and more recently, ""Collide"", with Laidback Luke & Project 46. In an interview with EDMSauce.com, Collin said ""collaborating with Laidback Luke was really cool, I used to frequent his production forum two years ago trying to find any sort of tips I could absorb. To be featured on a track of his that I wrote two years later is pretty surreal."" In addition to his vocal success, McLoughlin has received acclaim for his melodic bass remixes that have been supported by the likes of Don Diablo, Morgan Page, and 3LAU. In 2014 Collin was named as one of the ""10 Acts to Watch in 2014"" by popular website EDMTunes.com  as well as YourEDM.com. In March 2014, Dash Berlin previewed an ""ID"" at Utrecht (ASOT 650) that had many speculating as to whether Collin's vocals were featured on the single. On June 6, McLoughlin formally announced the ""Here Tonight"" collaboration with Jay Cosmic and Dash Berlin off his forthcoming ""We Are"" album releasing on Armada. On July 25, the ""Here Tonight"" video, shot on location in Mérida, Mexico, was subsequently released online to considerable fanfare. EDMSauce.com, EDMTunes.com, and YouTube channel Proximity dubbed ""Here Tonight"" a ""summer anthem"".
