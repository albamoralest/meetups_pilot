Since then he has worked in the advertising industry—as a copywriter and as a Creative Director—while living in Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland, Maine. Deily’s work has won several Clio Awards, Addy Awards, inclusion in the Communication Arts Advertising Annual, and other advertising industry honors.

"According to The Boston Phoenix, Deily lives and works in the Boston area, where he and his wife Lisa Deily have often performed with their band, Varsity Drag. The Boston Herald reported in 2015 that Deily was placing the band on hiatus for an indeterminate period.

"Deily's band Varsity Drag has performed with The Lemonheads, sharing a bill with them at New York City's Bowery Ballroom in June, 2009. At the 2010 South by Southwest music festival in Austin, Texas, Deily joined Dando on stage for an acoustic performance of several of their early Lemonheads songs. In September 2012 it was reported in a variety of sources (The Guardian, SPIN, pitchfork, NME) that Ryan Adams would be producing and playing on a Lemonheads “reunion” album of sorts to feature Adams, Deily, Dando and long-time friend and collaborator Juliana Hatfield. Though it seems that some recording was actually accomplished (per posts to Ryan Adams’ Twitter feed, since deleted) no further developments have been reported.

"During 2013, Deily joined the Lemonheads on stage for several shows: first for a single song (""Amazing Grace"") in Chicago in April, and then for a short set of songs during a series of dates around New England during July—including the ""Outside the Box"" festival (where Lemonheads shared a bill with Boston bands Buffalo Tom and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones).
