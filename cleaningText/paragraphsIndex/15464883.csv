"Kumi Miyasato provided the voice of the pivotal character, Eve Tokimatsuri, in the first two parts of the hit Original Animated Video series, Megazone 23. Her character was a computer-simulated pop idol. Megazone 23 Part 1 was the very second OAV in anime history and the very first to make a profit. It is said that this is largely due to Kumi's vocal performance (both spoken and sung), which is often called by its fans the highlight of the series. She has been said to rival Mari Iijima of The Super Dimension Fortress Macross fame. Megazone 23 was originally conceived as a standard 26-episode television series. The plot was condensed into two, direct-to-video, 80-minute movies, due to the sponsor pulling out. It is unknown whether Kumi Miyasato would have been cast as Eve or not had the television series been created.

"There was also a Part 3 of Megazone 23, but it was a disjointed story that bore little resemblance to what had come before. Eve was the only returning character, but Kumi Miyasato – whether of her own choosing or not is unknown – did not reprise the role.
