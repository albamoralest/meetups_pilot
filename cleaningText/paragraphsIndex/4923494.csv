"Cassell began to fuse calypso with other genres such as Zouk, R&B, and salsa. This resulted in some criticism and accusations that he was destroying Montserrat's calypso traditions. Others argued that his updating of the genre brought it to a new audience. In 1982, Cassell began working with arranger Leston Paul and recorded ""Hot Hot Hot"". This became his biggest hit, It was the biggest selling soca hit of all time. ""Hot Hot Hot"" was composed by Arrow's brother, Justin 'Hero' Cassell. The song was adopted as the theme song of the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, and was later covered by Buster Poindexter, Menudo, and Babla & Kanchan. Arrow capitalised on this success with 1983's Heat album, and the ""Rub Up"" single, and 1984's Soca Savage album, from which the international hit ""Long Time"" was taken, a top 30 hit in the United Kingdom. He enjoyed further chart success in the UK with a remixed version of ""Hot Hot Hot"", which reached number 38 (the original had stalled at number 58). By this time, Arrow was also incorporating Latin brass into his music. Subsequent albums also saw the incorporation of merengue (1986's Heavy Energy), and rock (1988's Knock Dem Dead). Heavy Energy was his first album for Island Records' Mango label, with two further albums released on the label.

"Cassell established himself as a businessman in Montserrat in 1973, owning the Arrow's Manshop store in Plymouth. When this was destroyed by the Soufriere Hills volcanic eruption, he relocated to St. John's, Antigua. He organised a fundraising calypso festival on the island in 1996, in response to the devastation caused by the volcano. Cassell co-headlined Bermuda's Soca '96 festival, and continued to regularly release albums. In 1988, he was given the Living Legends award by the organizers of the Caribbean Song Festival and the Bahamas Tourist Board. Cassell continued to be much in demand in the Caribbean. He performed at the Cricket World Cup 2007 opening ceremonies with Shaggy, Byron Lee and Kevin Lyttle. His last performance was at a fund raising concert for Haiti at the Montserrat Cultural Center in January 2010.
