"Claude Pascal (Paris, February 19, 1921 – Paris, February 28, 2017) was a French composer. After studying at the Conservatoire de Paris, he obtained the 1945 Premier Prix de Rome for the cantata, La farce du contre Bandier. After a brief period as conductor of the Opéra-Comique, Pascal became professor at the Paris Conservatoire in 1952, a position he held until his retirement in 1987. From 1969 to 1979 he worked as a music critic for Le Figaro, and from 1983 to 1991 he was an expert on copyright issues at the Paris Court of Appeals. Pascal's extensive work as a composer includes practically every musical genre. The discography of his works consists of more than thirty CDs. The musical estate of Claude Pascal is archived at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.
