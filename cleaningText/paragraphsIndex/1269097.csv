"Day was the first lead singer for Iron Maiden from 1975 to 1976. On the Iron Maiden The Early Days DVD it was mentioned that Day was fired because he did not have enough stage charisma. He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock. Years later he claimed the co-authorship concerning the song ""Strange World"".
