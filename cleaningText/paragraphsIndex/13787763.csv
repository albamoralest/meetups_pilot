"In 1988-89, a 20-year-old exchange student from California Institute of the Arts, was living in The Hague in The Netherlands and studying at the Institute of Sonology. Josh Gabriel had already been working with digital music since his high-school days, achieving mastery of the DX7 and TX816 by the age of 17. With an Apple Macintosh Plus, operating system 3, and the earliest of music applications like Mark of the Unicorn's ""Composer"" and ""Performer"", Josh was already at the bleeding edge. In the Netherlands, Gabriel's inventor spirit took shape as he wrote a computer application to control samples on an Akai S900 in real-time with a joystick. And the inception for what later became Mixman had been born. Along with electronics whiz Jan Pannis, (Stockhausen's tech-man) Gabriel and Pannis built an apparatus which converted beams of light coming up off the floor into a Midi Control device and the 20-year-old Gabriel dressed in black, wearing white gloves performed his real-time beat-trigger device in the clubs of Amsterdam.

"By 1993 Gabriel was doing high-end digital sound editing, design and production in Los Angeles, and finally found a business partner and the journey that was to become Mixman began. Mixman had always been conceived as a hardware device, the ""Walkman"", the ""Discman"", the ""Mixman""... and several proto-types were built. The path to hardware was longer than software and in late 1995 early 1996 the first Mixman application was released to the public. Spin Control, included 8 songs from the San Francisco underground Dance Music scene, that were remixable with only a PC, enough RAM and a proper sound card.

"Gabriel's patents for loop-based music remixing are the backbone of industry standard music making software applications used in virtually every producers studio today. By 1999, Mixman had evolved and grown and merged with a larger dot.com. Expanding briefly to the Mac platform and deepening its relationship with Record Labels and MTV as well as starting work with Mattel on a controller (eventually became the DM2) -- things looked good. But as happened with many dot.coms the ride got bumpy. In late 2000 Gabriel decided he had had his fill of the corporate life, and decided he wanted to return to ""music"". In 2002 Mixman sprung free of the dot.com shackles and returned to independence.

"Before he attended music school in the Netherlands and Los Angeles and started experimenting with synthesizers and computers in the early 1980s. At the same time Dave Dresden was a club deejay in a suburb of New York City as well as a renowned US dance music journalist. He became the Music Director of grooveradio.com and met Pete Tong, who asked him to help find music for the Essential Selection. They met at a party being hosted by grooveradio.com at the Miami Winter Music Conference in March 2001. Josh gave Leon Alexander a record, the record was ""Wave 3"", which Dave then gave to Pete Tong, and he played it on the Essential Selection and also used it for his compilation that same year. Pete gave Dave the opportunity to do a spec mix of New Order and Dave asked Josh to work on it with him. The two joined forces in 2001 and made a name for themselves by creating numerous remixes. In 2002 Gabriel & Dresden released their first single ""Lament"" (Saw Recordings) in the United States. The duo released numerous singles and number one Billboard hits like ""Tracking Treasure Down"" and ""Dangerous Power""; They also released one self-titled studio album together, Gabriel & Dresden. Josh played the electric bass on Armin van Buuren's single ""Zocalo"" in which both Dave & Josh produced the sounds.

"Josh spent his time off from Gabriel & Dresden starting a label called Different Pieces (via Armada Music) and working on three different album projects. The first, his 2008 solo album ""Eight"" which was named after the amount of analog synthesizers used to record it. He also worked on an album project for Winter Kills, Josh's band project with vocalist Meredith Call. This yielded the song ""Deep Down"" which charted on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and was on Armin Van Buuren's A State of Trance 2009 year-end compilation. He also produced the debut album for Andain ""You Once Told Me"" which finally saw a release in 2012 and spawned a sizable hit with the song, ""Promises (Andain song)"", which Gabriel & Dresden remixed in 2011.
