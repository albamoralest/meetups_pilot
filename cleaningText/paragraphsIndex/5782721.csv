In 1979 he spent several months travelling and ended up in London where he immersed himself in concerts, museums and galleries. Returning to Melbourne he formed the improvising group Laughing Hands with Gordon Harvey, Ian Russell and Paul Widdicombe. The group existed in several forms until disbanding in 1982.

"In 2002, Schütze began working with Alan Cristea Gallery London. In 2003, his first solo show, Vertical Memory, opened at ACG. The show included prints, video, sound and a huge wall work in which the whole of Alain Robbe-Grillet's novel Topology of A Phantom City, was rendered as a continuous plane of silver text. In 2004, Stiftelsen 314 in Bergen, Norway mounted his solo show Garden of Instruments. This was the next stage in a large-scale project that began in 1997 with the release of Schutze's spoken architectural opera Second Site and continued with a series of lightboxes for ACG also in 2004. This project, which is still ongoing, now has its own site.
