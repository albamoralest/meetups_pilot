"Wifebeater's playing style when soloing (with hand above and over the fretboard) is one of the things that gave the Mentors' guitars a unique sound. His signature sound is fluid with alternating bottom-heavy crunch with fast-noted metal runs. When performing, Wifebeater wears a black executionerâ€™s hood, according to a Guitar World ""Behind the Mask: A Brief History of Guitarists with an Identity Crisis"", Guitar World, September 5, 2008</ref>
