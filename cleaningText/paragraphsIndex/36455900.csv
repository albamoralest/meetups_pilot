"Growing up on the north and west side of Nashville, Tha City Paper slowly began to plant his seeds without even knowing. Around 1996â€“1997 while in high school, Paper was dating the cousin of a rapper named Pistol. He was also cool with Pistol's cousins, who were a part of a group called ""PJN"", whom Pistol created. Marcus Fitzgerald, Tha City Paper's name, was also a thriving young basketball player before joining the hip-hop scene.

"Young Paper began to listen in a lot on the group PJN recording sessions, and slowly but surely his interest in rap was peaking. He later became a part of that group as well. Over time, he featured on plenty of Pistol's tracks, and slowly made a name for himself. He has made many songs, including, ""City Paper (dope boy swagg)"", and ""Lil Bo Tuff"" which were off his independent album Paper View.
