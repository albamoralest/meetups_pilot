"Jeff Dean got his start in music with Las Vegas-based hardcore band Tomorrows Gone in 1994, joining the group early on in their existence after their original guitarist left the band to play metal. Dean played guitar on all of Tomorrows Gone's releases, as well as temporarily playing bass for the band's live shows in 1995. In 1996, Dean moved from Las Vegas to Detroit, while Tomorrows Gone vocalist Lance Wells moved to California. Despite the distance, Dean remained with the band until their breakup in 1997.
