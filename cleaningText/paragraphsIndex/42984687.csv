"In 2014, Scuccia applied to The Voice of Italy singing competition, singing for her audition ""No One"" by Alicia Keys. The performance received more than 104 million views on YouTube. She was very popular with the audience and all four judges—Raffaella Carrà, J-Ax, Noemi, and Piero Pelù—turned their chairs in the blind audition. Cristina chose to be part of Team J-Ax. Throughout the contest, she wore a simple crucifix around her neck, black shoes and ankle-length black religious habit. During the show, she sang ""The Cup of Life"" alongside Ricky Martin and during the final, she sang a duet with Kylie Minogue on ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". In the final, she won the trophy with 62% of the Italian votes against runner-up Giacomo Voli. After winning, she thanked God and recited the Lord's Prayer to the show organizers and audience.
