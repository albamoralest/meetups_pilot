"Although much of Strunk's material was humorous, his most popular song was not. ""Daisy a Day"", which Strunk wrote and recorded in 1973, is a gentle, sentimental ballad in 3/4 time, describing the relationship between a boy and girl who ultimately grow old together. For every day of their lives, he gives her a daisy as a sign of their love. In the last verse, she has died, but her widower husband continues to make daily visits to her grave. The song made the Billboard Top 20 on both the country and pop music charts. A cover version, Een Roosje, M'n Roosje (A Rose, My Rose) by Conny Vandenbos, reached No. 7 on the Dutch Top 40 hit list in 1974.

"Strunk also wrote three humorous songs that made it into the country music charts, and he toured with the Andy Williams Road Show. One of these songs, ""The Biggest Parakeets in Town,"" was a tongue-in-cheek story of a woman who is a bird fancier. Its central joke is the unspoken pun of ""parakeets/pair o'tits"" used in the title. Other singles, such as ""Next Door Neighbor's Kid"" and the patriotic ""My Country,"" appeared on various Billboard surveys. Strunk also scored a songwriting hit with ""Bill Jones' General Store"", the title track of his 1971 album of a similar name; Canadian musician Tommy Hunter charted in the top 20 on the country and adult contemporary charts in Canada with the song.
