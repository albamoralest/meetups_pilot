"In the early to mid-1990s, Rush was involved in a series of shorts made for Comedy Central's show Small Doses, titled Food for Thought.

He released an additional comedy album in 1997. During this time, he made sporadic stand-up comedy appearances. He worked on Bob ""Wolf"" Wohlfeld's show in the late 1990s on PYX 106 with The Wakin' Up with the Wolf Show, where he was a co-host.
