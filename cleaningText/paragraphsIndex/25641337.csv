"Armandinho (born Armando da Costa Macêdo, May 23, 1953) is a Brazilian composer and singer. He was born in Salvador, the son of Osmar Macêdo, from the world's first trio elétrico, the Trio Elétrico de Dodô e Osmar. (In the 1940s, at the same time the electric guitar was invented, Osmar Macêdo along with bandmate Adolfo Nascimento [who was an electrical engineer] independently created the Guitarra Baiana, a type of electric cavaquinho, which gave the Trio Elétrico its name.) In his early career, he played in his bands Trio Elétrico Mirim in 1962 and Hell's Angels in 1967.
