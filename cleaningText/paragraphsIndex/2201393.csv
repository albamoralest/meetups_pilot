"Doss went on to restart The Sunshine Fix. That band's first full-length album, Age of the Sun, was released in 2002. In 2004, TSF released the less well received Green Imagination (which featured artwork and videos by Kevin Evans). Doss began touring with The Apples in Stereo in early 2006, playing keyboards. He appeared on the Apples' 2007 album New Magnetic Wonder, was listed as a full-fledged band member on the band's 2010 album Travellers in Space and Time, and contributed to the songwriting on both albums. At the time of his death, Doss was producing albums in his own studio in Athens.
