"Jennings was born in Nashville, Tennessee on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname ""Shooter"". His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. “I love my mom,” says Jennings, “but I like Dad's version better. And I believe it's true. He didn't make [stuff] like that up.""
