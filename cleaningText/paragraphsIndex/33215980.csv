In 1990 Kawai was studying at Aichi Prefectural University of Arts and Music and attended his lesson in Nagoya. She played Chopin's Sonata in B minor Op.58. After the lesson Ekier immediately told Kawai to come to Poland, to his class at Chopin Music Academy in Warsaw. During the Japan tour Ekier had lessons with over 60 pianists, mainly Chopin Competition participants in October 1990, but only Kawai was invited as his pupil. At that time Ekier told the masterclass interpreter about Kawai: ""She has great potential. And she has very good hands as a pianist.""
