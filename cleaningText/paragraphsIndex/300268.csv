"Mansell was raised in Coventry, then in Warwickshire. For a decade from their foundation in 1986, Mansell was a member of Pop Will Eat Itself, as a lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, producer and writer or co-writer of many of the band's songs. The band were pioneers of sampling and electronic music in the UK alternative rock scene, bringing influences from hip hop, industrial music, house, and other dance genres into their music. In the United States, PWEI were signed in 1994 to Nothing Records the label owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Mansell and Reznor, a long time fan of PWEI, became friends after Mansell moved to New York, and Mansell subsequently performed backing vocals on Nine Inch Nails' 1999 album The Fragile.

"Mansell started composing film soundtracks when director Darren Aronofsky hired him to score his debut film, Pi, in 1996. He also wrote the score for Aronofsky's next film, Requiem for a Dream, which became a cult hit. The film's primary composition ""Lux Aeterna"" was popular, appearing in adverts, film trailers, and YouTube videos labelled as Epic Music. Mansell has composed the music to every subsequent Aronofsky film with the sole exception of mother!.
