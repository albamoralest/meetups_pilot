Though they recorded several uptempo tracks, such as ""Big Apple Rock"", ""Walking Downtown (On A Saturday Night)"", ""What Goes Around (Comes Around)"" and, later, ""Mainline"" (written by Burgess, but recorded after he left the group), Black Ivory faced tough competition from the rise of disco, but proved unable to compete when disco became the dominant music style.
