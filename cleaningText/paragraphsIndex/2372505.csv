Kanda made her Kōhaku Uta Gassen debut in December 2011 singing ""Ue o Muite Arukō"" alongside her mother, Seiko Matsuda. In July 2012, Kanda debuted as a voice actress on TV animation Good Luck Girl!, which led her to be cast as Anna in the Japanese language dub of Disney's animated film Frozen. She won the Best Lead Actress award for the role in the 9th Seiyu Awards. Later, in 2016, she dubbed the singing voice of Poppy in the Japanese-language dub of the DreamWorks Animation's animated film Trolls. In 2019, she voiced as Anna once again for Kingdom Hearts III. In April 2014, she formed the duo Trustrick with guitarist Billy. They released their debut album, Eternity, on June 25 of the same year. They disbanded on 17 December 2016. Kanda appeared as a special guest in the Alan Symphony Concert from December 20, 2014 alongside Tibetan Chinese diva Alan Dawa Dolma, and together, they sang a music piece originally performed by Alan titled ""Kaze no Tegami"" (風の手紙, ""Letter in the Wind"").
