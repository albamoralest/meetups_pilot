"From Maghnia (Tlemcen Province), Mourad Gana, better known under the name Gana El Maghnaoui, was born 2 February 1958 in Maghnia, Algeria. As a musician, he plays the violin as well as the trumpet. His debut in rai music dates back to 1973. He was part of the orchestra of the Oran section of the RTA (1974–1980), then in Algiers. In 1978, he released two EPs and a year later he recorded an 8 track cassette.
