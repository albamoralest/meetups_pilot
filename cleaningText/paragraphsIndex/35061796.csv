"In 1997, Fine formed Ex-Centric Sound System with drummer Michael Avgil and three Ghanaian vocalists, Nana Dadzie, Adevo Savour and Benjamin Kouleho, who also contribute melodies on flute, kalimba and balafon. NME described Ex-Centric Sound System as ""a band that mixes authentic African sounds with dub, techno and hip-hop,"" adding that the band is ""a triumph of the collective imagination."" Their debut album, Electric Voodooland, was released in 2001. The New York Post called it ""a beautiful beast… a very unusual album that avoids pop convention and clichés.""In 2007, he released the solo album Live in Jerusalem, consisting of four tracks culled from his one-man bass tour. ""Few people are brave, or crazy, enough to stand on stage with a few simple drum loops, an effects board and a bass, and go for it. Yet that's exactly what he does, amazingly well,"" wrote PopMatters. ""The landscapes he paints are orchestral, lush and textured."" An introduction to Fine on Israeli music television station Music 24 proclaimed, ""Yossi Fine does to bass what Hendrix did for electric guitar.""

Fine plays bass in The Touré-Raichel Collective, a collaboration between Touré and Idan Raichel, which led to the 2012 album The Tel Aviv Sessions. Haaretz singled out his bass playing for being ""flexible and dynamic.""Fine has performed, recorded with and produced music for musicians across the globe, including Naughty By Nature (creating the bassline for their 1993 hit single ""Hip Hop Hooray""), Gil Evans, John Scofield, Kenny Kirkland, Lou Reed, Rubén Blades, Stanley Jordan, Me'shell Ndegeocello, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Anthony B, Karsh Kale, Cheb i Sabbah, Antibalas, Hassan Hakmoun, Hadag Nahash, Ofra Haza, Noa and Hamsa Lila.

",13,== Artistic style ==
"An early adopter of live looping in order to perform as a one-man band, Fine's style in his solo work has been called ""extreme bass groove,"" incorporating drum & bass, breakbeat, dubstep and heavy metal influences. ""When you cop such an attack on bass guitar, and make a line come at you with such power, that's extreme bass,"" he has said. ""It's about creating a sound with tons of low end that pounds you in the chest and makes you go, Whoa!""Fine has called U2 guitarist The Edge a huge influence, stating that his ""echo-laden sound"" is ""the most innovative without being too technical.""
