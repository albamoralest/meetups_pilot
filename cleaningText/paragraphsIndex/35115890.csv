He joined his childhood friend Charley Patton in a recording session for Paramount Records in Grafton, Wisconsin, in June 1929. Sims accompanied Patton on fiddle on thirteen tracks, including ""Elder Greene Blues"", ""Going to Move to Alabama"" and ""Devil Sent the Rain Blues""; and recorded four of his own songs, including ""Tell Me Man Blues"", his best-known composition, and ""Farrell Blues"". He played alongside Patton at times until the Patton's death in 1934, when Sims returned to working on a plantation. By then he could also play the mandolin, guitar and piano. On August 28, 1941, Sims accompanied Muddy Waters in a recording session under the direction of Alan Lomax, as part of his recordings for the Library of Congress.
