"Sadeghi began studying the santur at the age of 7 with a music teacher coincidentally named Manoochehr Sadeghian.  By the age of 14 he became the prized pupil of a legendary figure in Persian classical music, the late Ostad Abol Hassan Saba;  who was a master and creator of the Radif of Saba, considered today's manual to mastering Persian classical music.  At the age of 19 he performed in Saba's first orchestra of the State Fine Arts Department of Iran.  After performing on Iran's television and radio, he went on to stage live concerts around the world for various heads of state. In 1964, Sadeghi emigrated to the United States to pursue his education and career. First at the California State University, Fullerton, and then at UCLA, where he began teaching and performing while earning his degrees.  In 1973 he was awarded the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship Program.
