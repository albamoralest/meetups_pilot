"Born in Dresden in 1958 to a family of opera singers, Jahns began her vocal studies in 1975 at the Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber Dresden; she attended master classes with Judith Beckmann, Ute Niss and Theo Adam. In 1982, she was accepted into the opera studio of the Semperoper, and from 1986, she was a member of the ensemble of the Semperoper.

She portrayed the title role in Bettina by Friedrich Schenker to a libretto by Karl Mickel, premiered at the Theater im Palast in Berlin on 2 September 1987, and recorded.
