"Kaydean Phillips was born Stephen Ricardo Budda in London, England. When he was 2 years old, his parents married and his last name was changed to his father's last name, Phillips. However, he adopted the name Kaydean Phillips to avoid confusion with other composers with the same first name. Looking for new opportunities in America, Kaydean's family moved to the Bronx, New York when he was seven years old. A child prodigy, Kaydean mastered multiple instruments before his teens including, Drums, Saxophone, Clarinet, Piano and Bugle.
