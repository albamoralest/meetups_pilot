"In an interview with music magazine Spin in 1992, Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails made derogatory remarks about Front Line Assembly, calling them ""a textbook case of a band"" for industrial music and their music ""monotonous, boring, uninspired bullshit"". Before the release of the issue, Reznor sent Leeb an apology letter. Spin printed the letter, along with a letter from Leeb dismissing the notion that Reznor was ""leading the industrial revolution in music"" in one of their following issues.
