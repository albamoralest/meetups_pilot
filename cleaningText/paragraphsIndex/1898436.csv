"James Oswald Little was born on 1 March 1937, a member of the Yorta Yorta people with his mother, Frances, a Yorta Yorta woman and his father, James Little Sr, from the Yuin people. Little's totem is the long-necked turtle. Jimmy Little Sr. was a tap dancer, comedian, musician and singer who led his own vaudeville troupe along the Murray River during the 1930s and 1940s. His mother was a singer and yodeller who had joined Jimmy Sr.'s troupe. Little grew up, the eldest of seven children, on the Cummeragunja Aboriginal Reserve on the Murray River in New South Wales, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Echuca in Victoria. Little later recalled his upbringing, ""[my parents] taught me well about the value of life, freedom, love, respect, all those basic things that we need. As Vaudevillians, I loved them. It was part of my dream to follow in the footsteps of Mum and Dad. And I'm so proud that I was able to do that"". He became a devout non-denominational Christian. He is an uncle of writer, soprano, and composer Deborah Cheetham and older brother of the late Aboriginal author and singer-songwriter Betty Little. In February 1939, about 200 to 300 members of the mission participated in the Cummeragunja walk-off – in protest at the low standard living conditions. The Little family moved to his father's tribal land (near Wallaga Lake) and lived for some years on the New South Wales south coast at Nowra and Moruya. Not long after moving, Frances died from a tetanus infection after cutting her finger on an oyster shell. At the age of 13 Little was given a guitar and within a year he was playing at local concerts. When 16 years old he travelled to Sydney to perform on a radio programme, Australia's Amateur Hour. In 1955 Little left home to live in Sydney and pursue a career in country music, he was influenced by Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis and Jim Reeves. His mellow style earned him the nicknames of ""the Balladeer"", ""Gentleman Jim"" and ""the Honey Voice"".

"In 1956, Little signed with Regal Zonophone Records and released his first single, ""Mysteries of Life""/""Heartbreak Waltz"". In 1958, Little married fellow singer, Marjorie Rose Peters. By late 1959, Little was living in Granville with his wife and their daughter Frances Claire – he released the single, ""Frances Claire"", when she was 18 months-old. It was issued on EMI's Columbia label and was soon followed by ""Give the Coloured Boy a Chance"", which had been written by his father – the first song released in Australia referring to indigenous issues and first both written and recorded by indigenous musicians. He worked at a towelling factory and supplemented his income with performances at concerts and dances, and TV appearances on Bandstand. Little signed with Festival Records and in September 1959, he had his first charting single, ""Danny Boy"", from the extended play, Jimmy Little Sings Ballads with a Beat, which peaked at No. 9 in Sydney. In February 1960, his next single was ""El Paso"", which reached No. 12 in Sydney. Little made his acting debut in the Billy Graham evangelical feature film Shadow of the Boomerang the same year. Little had the role of Johnny, a devout stockman on a cattle station where his American employer's son Bob refers to him as ""that nigger"". After Johnny dies, while saving Bob's life, from being gored by a wild boar, Bob has a religious conversion to Graham's cause. Little issued the title song as a single backed by ""Little by Little"". In September 1961, he appeared on the radio program, Col Joye Show, with fellow Bandstand regulars, Patsy Ann Noble and Judy Stone. By 1962, Little joined a touring stage production, All Coloured Show produced by Ted Quigg, and gained wider public exposure. In July 1963, he toured north west New South Wales with Rob E.G., Noleen Batley and Lonnie Lee and was personally booked out till November. In October 1963, after 17 singles, Little issued his biggest hit with the gospel song, ""Royal Telephone"", based upon the Burl Ives' version. In November it peaked at No. 1 in Sydney and No. 3 in Melbourne. The following month Australian Women's Weekly's music writer, Bob Rogers described it as ""a sincere ballad with a religious feeling"" and that ""[i]n only three weeks the record was rising to the top all over Australia, one of the fastest-selling records of the year"". It was awarded 3× Gold certification by Festival Records and ""Best Male Vocal Disk"" (1963) in ""The Tunetable Awards"", Australia's first disk awards from a major radio source for home-produced disks. In March 1964 the Barry Gibb-penned ""One Road"" reached No. 19 in Sydney and No. 30 in Melbourne. Gibb was 17 years old when he wrote ""One Road"" and Little became one of the first artists to record a Gibb song. The magazine Everybody's named him Australian Pop Star of the Year. Little was backed by the Jimmy Little Trio which had an all-indigenous line-up of Cyril Green, Doug Peters and Neville Thorn. Little's final hit of the era came in September 1974 with ""Baby Blue"" which peaked at No. 8 in Melbourne and No. 37 in Sydney. Further non-charting singles were released until 1978's ""Beautiful Woman"". From the end of the 1970s, Little turned from his musical career to focus on his family and becoming qualified as a teacher.

As well as appearing in Tracey Moffatt's Night Cries and Andrew Schultz's opera Black River, his teaching and community work earned him the title of NAIDOC Aboriginal of the Year in 1989. After winning that award Little returned to working in the music industry. In 1992, Little performed at the Tamworth on Parade and Kings of Country roadshows before releasing his 14th album, Yorta Yorta Man, in 1994.

Other honorary doctorates have been awarded to Little by Queensland University of Technology and Australian Catholic University. Little was diagnosed with kidney failure and, in 2004, after two years of self-administered dialysis he received a life-saving kidney transplant. The experience led him to launch the Jimmy Little Foundation in 2006 to help the many other indigenous Australians who are succumbing to kidney disease. The foundation works with patients in regional and remote Australia and partnered with The Fred Hollows Foundation in 2009 to develop a nutrition and education program for indigenous children to reduce the cycle of bad nutrition leading to diabetes which can lead to kidney failure and diabetic retinopathy. At the APRA Awards of 2010 Little was awarded the Ted Albert Award for 'Outstanding Services to Australian Music'. Actor and musician Michael Tuahine proposed a play based on the life of Jimmy Little. The play was written by Reg Cribb and called Country Song; it won the 2013 Rodney Seaborn Playwright's Award for New Work. It was performed by the Queensland Theatre Company in the Cremorne Theatre at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in August 2015.
