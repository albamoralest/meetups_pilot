"Born in Naples, Barbieri started his career in 1993 under the production by Pino Daniele. He was a member of the vocal group Neri per Caso between 2000 and 2002.  He has worked as a songwriter for other artists. Although he started out a pop singer, he moved to a more sophisticated style. His music combines world music, jazz, and the tradition of the Italian cantautori. Along his career he dedicated two albums to his vocal jazz heroes: Chet Baker (Chet Lives!) and Billie Holiday (Dear Billie).
