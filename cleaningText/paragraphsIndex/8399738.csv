"Mayo was born in Hammersmith, London on 24 July 1951.  At an early age, he listened to the classical music his father played while at home. Later, he heard ""Apache"" by The Shadows and enjoyed the record. However, it was when Mayo saw the group on television with their Fender Stratocasters that he became passionate.

"After being expelled from school, Cawthra began using the performing name of Mayo and worked in a printing shop before joining the blues band White Mule in 1969. The band stayed together for about a year and played all over the United Kingdom, along with gigs in Switzerland and France. They released a single on MCA Records which was produced by Mike Leander. After White Mule, Mayo played in various rock line-ups during the early to mid-1970s including Halcyon, 747 and Alias. He also was part of an Irish traditional band called Concrete Mick where he played the mandolin before becoming Wilko Johnson's replacement in Dr Feelgood.

"Mayo had been relatively unknown until early 1977 when he replaced Wilko Johnson in Dr. Feelgood, although Henry McCullough had temporarily stood in when Johnson left. He was known as John Mayo until, having suffered several minor ailments, Dr. Feelgood's Lee Brilleaux said ""you've always got the gyp"" and the nickname stuck. Mayo played with Dr. Feelgood for four years and on six albums (Be Seeing You, Private Practice, As It Happens, Let It Roll, A Case of the Shakes and On The Job). He co-wrote the Feelgood's only UK Top 10 single ""Milk and Alcohol"" with Nick Lowe, and played on four of the five other Dr. Feelgood singles to have appeared in the UK Singles Chart (""She's A Wind Up"", ""Down at the Doctors"", ""As Long As The Price is Right"" and ""Put Him Out of Your Mind""); the only Feelgood single to have charted without him was ""Sneakin' Suspicion"".
