"Isdal was initially influenced by hard rock bands like Kiss, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple; and progressive rock bands like Pink Floyd and King Crimson; before discovering heavy metal. He joined his first band, the extreme metal act Malignant Eternal, in the mid 1990s and appeared on their album Alarm in 1999. He joined Enslaved in 2002, and has since appeared on nine studio albums with the band, starting with Below the Lights in 2003. He is also a member of the hard rock band Audrey Horne, for whom he plays guitar and bass. In 2006, Isdal participated in the black metal supergroup I and played on their album Between Two Worlds. With some other members of Enslaved plus the noise-rock group Fe-Mail, Isdal formed the side project Trinacria in 2008, which in turn released the album Travel Now Journey Infinitely. That same year, he made a guest appearance on the self-titled debut album by the glam metal band Bourbon Flame. With some of his Enslaved bandmates, Isdal provided his voice for a 2009 episode of the animated series Metalocalypse. Isdal made a guest appearance on the Ov Hell album The Underworld Regime in 2010, and the following year he played on the Demonaz album March of the Norse. He continues to perform full-time with Enslaved in the 2020s.
