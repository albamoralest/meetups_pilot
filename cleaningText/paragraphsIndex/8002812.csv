"Dougans' first releases were as ""Humanoid"", releasing the acid house single ""Stakker Humanoid"", which reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart in 1988, and also charted in 1992 and 2001. ""Stakker Humanoid"" was No.1 for five weeks in the UK Dance Chart (December 1988) and has been cited as a major influence on early Aphex Twin releases. Dougans music as Humanoid is also part of the MOMA NY collection via Stakker Eurotechno. Dougans has always been the quiet, technical workhorse of FSOL whilst Garry Cobain brings in his melody and softness to balance Dougans' technical wizardry.
