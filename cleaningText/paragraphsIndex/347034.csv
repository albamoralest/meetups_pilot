"Stace was artist-in-residence at Fairleigh Dickinson University, where he curates the Words & Music Festival. On 6 May 2010, the Festival ended with ""Jersey Rain: Robert Pinsky and Bruce Springsteen in conversation with John Wesley Harding"" in the Dreyfuss Theater; the conversation was later published in the journal Radio Silence. The series also included a presentation by Harding and Paul Muldoon on their collaboration.  In the Spring of 2013, the two writers taught a course at Princeton University entitled ""How To Write A Song"". In Spring 2013 at Central Connecticut State University, the English Department offered a course dedicated to Stace's songs and novels (""The Allusive John Wesley Harding/Wesley Stace,"" ENG 214). Harding returned to his given name for the release of his album, Self-Titled. Two of the tracks are co-written with The Fiery Furnaces' Eleanor Friedberger, and alternative versions also appear on her album Personal Record. Stace co-wrote all of the songs on Personal Record with Friedberger. Stace reveals the new album is autobiographical in nature, one of the reasons he chose not to release the new material under the moniker of John Wesley Harding. The self-reflective songs are also influenced by Stace's love of Seventies singer-songwriters, the softer sound a change he felt was a natural transition in his career. Stace's fourth novel, Wonderkid, was published in February 2014 by The Overlook Press. On 24 February 2017 Yep Roc Records released Wesley Stace’s John Wesley Harding, backed by The Jayhawks.
