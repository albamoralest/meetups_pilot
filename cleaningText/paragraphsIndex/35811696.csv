"When Crashdïet auditioned people to replace their original lead singer Dave Lepard after his death in January 2006, Cruz was their top choice. Cruz, however, decided to continue with his band Jailbait, causing Crashdïet to go with H. Olliver Twisted as their new lead singer.   Upon H. Olliver Twisted being kicked out of Crashdïet in 2008, they were once again in search of a new singer.  The band sought out Cruz again, and in July 2009, they announced Simon Cruz as their new lead singer. Cruz made his debut performance with the band in October 2009 at the Sweden Rock Cruise.
