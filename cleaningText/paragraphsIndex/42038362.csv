"According to Daniel Avorgbedor, Turkson's compositions were ""largely rooted in 20th-century avant-garde techniques"", in particular in his use of atonality and serialism. Most of his early piano works were of an educational nature. His later compositions included indigenous elements, inspired partly by his earlier research into Efutu music. Most of his works were published by the University of Ife Press in Nigeria. His best-known work is Three pieces for flute and piano (1968).
