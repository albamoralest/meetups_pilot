"Alex de Grassi (born February 13, 1952) is an American fingerstyle guitarist. Tom Wheeler wrote in Guitar Player magazine that his technique is ""the kind that shoves fellow pickers to the cliff of decision: should I practice like a madman or chuck it altogether?"" De Grassi was invited by his cousin William Ackerman to join the Windham Hill label and became one of the label's best sellers.
