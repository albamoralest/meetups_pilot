"Neil Andrew Carter (born 11 May 1958) is an English musician who has worked in diverse genres throughout his career. Classically trained, he became a professional rock musician at the age of 17 and initially had his first ""mainstream"" experience with singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan. He subsequently played guitar and keyboard for the hard rock band UFO, blues rock guitarist Gary Moore, and Wild Horses. He is credited for co-writing a number of Gary Moore's songs including the worldwide hit ""Empty Rooms"". At 30 he left the rock world and  developed a different career as both teacher of woodwind (saxophone and clarinet) and as an ABRSM examiner. 2010 saw an unexpected return to rock with Gary Moore, playing festivals across Europe and a tour of Ukraine and Russia. Future tours and a Celtic rock album were to follow but this was curtailed by the death of Gary Moore in February 2011.
