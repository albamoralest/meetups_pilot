"In his childhood, Drews lived in  Schleswig. After finishing school, he went on to study medicine at the University of Kiel, but dropped out of medical school to work as a singer. At age 15 he received an award as Best Banjo Player of Schleswig-Holstein, while playing in jazz band the Schnirpels. At school he played in ""The Monkeys"". In 1967 he was solo guitarist in the Kiel based psychedelic rock band ""Chimes of Freedom"", later renamed by its manager to ""Die Anderen"" (The Others). In that same year, Drews took on his first acting role in the German film comedy Zur Hölle mit den Paukern. He sang for the 70's pop group the ""Les Humphries Singers"" and started a solo career. He had a German number one hit in 1976 with ""Ein Bett im Kornfeld"", an adaptation of the Bellamy Brothers' ""Let Your Love Flow"" which was also a German number one.
