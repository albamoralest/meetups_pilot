"Born in South Africa, Mira Calix (real name Chantal Passamonte) moved to London in 1991. She began to work at a record shop and took up organizing parties and DJing. She worked at the labels 4AD and Warp Records, where she held the position of a publicist from 1994 to 1997. Calix's earlier music specialized in mixing her intimate vocals with jittering beats and experimental electronic textures and natural sounds. In 2003 she collaborated with the London Sinfonietta for the first time. Nunu premiered at the Royal Festival Hall in London at a concert titled ""Warp Works and 20th Century Masters"". The piece then toured internationally, performed by live insects, orchestra and Calix on electronics. Since then, she has incorporated orchestration and live classical instruments in her performances and recorded work. She has worked with visual artists and musicians from other disciplines to create music for dance, theatre, film, opera and installations. Calix has been commissioned to write new works for the London Sinfonietta, Bang on a Can, the Aldeburgh Festival, The Royal Shakespeare Company, Opera North, Streetwise Opera, the Manchester International Festival, National Arts Festival, Sydney Festival, Royal Northern Sinfonia, and more.

"In early 2008 Calix was commissioned to set Shakespeare's ""Sonnet 130"" to music. The project was curated by composer Gavin Bryars for The Royal Shakespeare Company. During 2007 there were two theatrical works; the first, an opera titled Elephant and Castle, for the Aldeburgh Festival, was a collaboration with composer Tansy Davies, directed by Tim Hopkins, libretto by author Blake Morrison. The second, Dead Wedding, premiered at the first Manchester International Festival. Extracts from these performances appear on the album The Elephant in the Room: 3 Commissions. The album also includes pieces from a video installation work titled Natures, a collaboration with video artist Quayola and cellist Oliver Coates.

The installation piece, inspired by Gregorio Allegri's 17th century choral work Miserere, is a collaboration with British video artists Flat-E. In December 2009, Calix won a British Composer Award for My Secret Heart. It was described by the judges as ""transformational, capturing raw humanity and giving voice to the disenfranchised in a sound-world which is original, absorbing and unsettling"". My Secret Heart also won a Royal Philharmonic Society Award in 2009 and was nominated for a National Lottery Arts Award in 2010. The installation toured in other countries too, both with The Creators Project and The British Council. In February 2009, she collaborated with United Visual Artists on Chorus for the opening of the Howard Assembly Rooms in Leeds.

"In 2015, Calix created a large scale mixed media installation, ""Inside There Falls"", a mixed media installation at Carriageworks, during the Sydney Festival. Her multi-sensory artwork consisted of 180 channel orchestral score and spoken word diffused through custom made speakers incorporated into 1.5 km of hand crushed paper. She invited Rafael Bonachela, choreographer and director of the Sydney Dance Company, to collaborate with her. Dancers wore hidden speakers and performed intermittently throughout the durational installation work. The audience was invited to immerse themselves in the work and don paper suits. It was on this project that Calix initiated her practice of creating what she termed ‘human diffusion’ incorporating small speakers into costumes of performers to create sound installations that are mobile.
