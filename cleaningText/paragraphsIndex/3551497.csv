"Mardones co-wrote the 1980 soft rock hit ""Into the Night"" with Robert Tepper. The track was featured on his second album Never Run, Never Hide, and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went platinum. Its success catapulted Mardones into the limelight, but he spiraled into substance abuse that resulted in his being dropped by his label Polydor Records. Though he eventually overcame his addiction, Mardones's career produced no other hits.

"In a TV interview on KTLA ""a while"" before his death, Mardones recalled how the song was inspired by a conversation between him and co-author Robert Tepper, after seeing a 16 year old neighbour take Benny's dog for a walk. In the real life scene, there was no romantic link. (YouTube video)
