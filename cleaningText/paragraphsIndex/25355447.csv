"SAWA went on to write many jingles for Japanese commercials, most famously for Naver's chat client LINE's ""LINE Pay"" and ""LINE Shopping"" service promotions. In 2012, SAWA penned and composed the title track of now disbanded 80s/90s revivalist idol/girl unit, Especia's debut single ""ミッドナイトConfusion"" (Midnight Confusion). In 2015, she produced ""ジュリエットのパラドックス"" for Ex-BiS member Terashima Yufu's second solo mini-album ""好きがはじまるII"" (Suki ga Hajimaru 2), ""ギザギザのロンリナイ"" (Giza Giza no Lonely Night) and for solo Electrodance Idol, KOTO. KOTO and SAWA released a collaboration single entitled ""KOTOSAWASISTERS"" released at KOTO's 17th birthday live ""-Rhymeberry x KOTO x Oyasumi Hologram- Midsummer 3man live!"" held at GLAD in Shibuya, Tokyo on 25 September that same year. SAWA has self-covered the songs she has produced for other artists, starting with ミッドナイトConfusion on her 2014 mini-album, Ringa Ringa, which also featured an interlude track for ミッドナイトConfusion featuring the then 6 member line up of Especia. She would later cover ジュリエットのパラドックス and ギザギザのロンリナイ on her 2016 mini-album, Odore Balcony (Dance Balcony). KOTO is featured on the interlude track to ""Oboroge Dancing"" and KOTO's resident producer Sasaki Kissa produced digital single ""Colorful World"", both can be found on SAWA's 2017 mini-album, Ijippari Mermaid (Obstinate Mermaid).
