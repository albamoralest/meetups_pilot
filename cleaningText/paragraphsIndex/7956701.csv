"Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Penner began classical violin lessons as a preschooler. She quickly showed an aptitude for the instrument and continued improving her skills. At the age of 15, she quit playing the violin for a couple of years, but then took it up again to start a band with her friends. Since then, she estimates she has recorded or performed live with more than 40 different groups.
