"Myers runs his own artist management company, Cursed Management Group. Myers made his first foray into artist management with the Memphis rock band Sore Eyes. After having seen the band play around the local area and been suitably impressed, he asked Sore Eyes to support Shinedown for a few sold-out shows at the Machine Shop in Flint, Michigan in December 2008. Unbeknownst to the band these performances were being used by Myers as an audition to see whether they could cut it as potential clients. According to vocalist Shi Eubank, after the shows Myers had said, ""Well, the reason I brought you out here is that I wanted to see if you'd sink or swim in front of a crowd like this ... and you guys are out here doing the breaststroke."" He then told the band that he would like to step in and work on the management end with them.
