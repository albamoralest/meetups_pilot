Signing to Sacred Bones Records in 2018, she followed up in February 2019 with Mazy Fly. It was met with universal acclaim by music critics, who enjoyed the dark and eerie qualities of Spellling's sound.

"Cabral was born in Sacramento, California. She was raised in the Catholic Church, which would later influence her music. Cabral attended the University of California, Berkeley, studying philosophy for two semesters before changing her major to English literature after feeling ""shamed out of the [philosophy] department"" as the only female and person of color. She remained at Berkeley to pursue a Master of Fine Arts, which she completed in 2019.

"Cabral started her musical career in 2015, influenced by two events: watching a fellow San Francisco artist performing looped vocals; and the death of a close friend. At the time she was working as an elementary school teacher, and being around crayons inspired her to release a handmade CD called Crayola Church. Cabral said of the project: “I took a Crayola box and made a record based on every color in the box… I would wrap the CDs in children’s drawings and write the track listing, so some people have those [editions].”In 2017, she self released her debut album Pantheon of Me. In 2019, she released a follow up, Mazy Fly, to positive reviews. In 2021, she released her third album, The Turning Wheel, to similarly positive reviews.
