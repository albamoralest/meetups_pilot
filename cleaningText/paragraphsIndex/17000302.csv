"Ric Segreto was born in Brooklyn, New York City to Bridget Segreto, an Italian-American and Godofredo G. Macaraeg, a Filipino. Ric, the second son of five brothers and one sister was raised for the first five years of his life in New York by his mother, a dietician at a New York hospital and his father, an abdominal surgeon.

He was captured by Japanese soldiers and made to march in the Bataan Death March and was imprisoned on Corregidor Island. After the War, Dr. Macaraeg traveled to the United States and attended Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Macaraeg was the first Filipino diplomate to the F.A.C.S.

"Both Ric's parents' love for music influenced his interest in music and singing. The family moved to the Philippines in 1957, where his father set up a physician's practice. Ric went to Lourdes School of Quezon City. In 1959, the family relocated to Guam, where growing up in a milder environment furthered Ric's interest in the performing arts. Ric played in a rock band with his elder brother Gordon, ages 12 and 13, and with grandsons of Filipino composer Nicanor Abelardo. Ric's band, The Asteroids, played in bars patronized by military personnel.

After a year at the Ateneo, Ric returned to Guam. He then formed another band that included his brother Goff, Victor James, Dean Sampaio, and Joe Guererro, called the Salvation Army, singing and playing all over the island during weekends until he completed his high school.  Going to college made Ric look to the States and choosing Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, where he majored in history.

"A lover of history and education Ric's fondness for the written word led him to take a break from performing and dedicate some of his passion to teaching and writing. Touching base with his other home, Ric became a teacher in Guam and endeavored to enlighten high school students with his flair for history. He submitted sociology articles to a local Philippine magazine, MAN Magazine, after returning to the Philippines to record another album. Ric was also working on a thesis that addressed the Philippine music industry.

"While teaching in Guam, Ric supplemented his free time performing in local beach bars and night clubs with his younger brother Gordon. Ric's sibling expressed some consternation at Ric's reluctance to practice and the latter's overt willingness to play songs they had never played before; perhaps Ric's way to sharpen his brother Gordon's musical abilities, but caused many embarrassing moments. Ric was also known for having Gordon start a set and then even before the first verse was started Ric would say, ""I'll be right back"".  Well into the song Gordon would find Ric sitting at the bar enjoying a beer and happily waving at him from the audience.  The band Ric and Gordon started was called the Bunelos Brothers, (name provided by Gordon). Ric, being the assumed professional he was, thought that name was perfect for their little music project (not too serious but enough to provoke controversy). The Bunelos Brothers were a regular feature at Tahiti Rama, Barney's Beach House and The Signature Pub. Their repertoire consisted mainly of Beatles music, easy listing tunes, MOR, and ballads. Their voices were homogenous and harmonies came very easily for them. Just like brothers all over the globe, not every decision was 100% mutual. There were fights on stage but most of them were mainly scowling looks and failures to sing back up. In some cases Gordon would get even with Ric and refuse to play. Ric would give his brother the ""I'm going to kill you look"" but Gordon knew his bark was worse than his bite. The Bunelos Brothers played together for 3 years going through an assortment of other members, including their eldest brother Goff.
