"Jackson was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1937. He grew up in Latta, South Carolina, where he sang in a gospel group, until moving to Pittsburg, Pennsylvania at age 13. Between 1957 and 1959, he was a member of The Del-Vikings, singing lead on the 1957 release ""Willette."" After leaving them, he was ""discovered"" by Luther Dixon when he opened for Jackie Wilson at the Apollo Theater. He signed a recording contract with Scepter Records subsidiary Wand Records. ""I Don't Want to Cry,"" his first single, which he co-wrote (with Luther Dixon) and recorded in November 1960, was his first hit (released in January 1961). The song charted on both the R&B and pop charts. In 1962, Jackson's recording of the Burt Bacharach-Bob Hilliard song ""Any Day Now"" became a huge hit and his signature song. His popularity in the 1960s prompted him to buy the time on his contract from Scepter and move to Motown Records. A decision he later commented upon as ""one of the worst mistakes I ever made in my life"" There he recorded a few successful singles, including ""Honey Come Back."" He later recorded for All Platinum and other labels, but with minimal success. After meeting producer/composer Charles Wallert at the Third Annual Beach Music Awards, the two collaborated to record ""How Long Have You Been Loving Me"" on Carolina Records.
