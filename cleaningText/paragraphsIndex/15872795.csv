"He was raised in Chicago's South Side neighborhood known as the ""Wild 100's"" and is a former member of the Blackstone Rangers street gang. In his youth he became friendly with rapper Common. He is dyslexic, which he first realized as a teenager. He has evolved over the years from a street poet into an actor, mainly acting out his ""street hustler"" persona. In an interview an ex-girlfriend said this persona couldn't be further from the truth. His name means ""King Joseph"" (Malik and  Yusuf, respectively) in Arabic

"As a spoken word artist, poetry allowed Yusef the aesthetic freedom to comment on a wide breadth of personal and social issues while his lyrics remained commensurate with a global vision: to encourage the benevolence in all people. His voice incorporates street vernacular against backdrops of hip-hop beats, organic keyboards, guitars and horns. The Chicago native has made his career as a ""wordsmith,"" reciting verses that chronicle inner city life growing up on the urban streets of the Windy City. His lexicon tells stories that speak to both the intricate depths and heights of ghetto culture, as well as global socio-economic woes. The inspiration to formulate his mosaic of words comes from his children, his dreams, the ancestors and other prolific poets. Some of his influences include Langston Hughes, William Shakespeare, Haki Madhubuti and Phillis Wheatley. His spoken word artistry has contributed to promotional campaigns including ASCAP, Sprite, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Chrysler, Verizon, Miller Brewing Co. and Nike.

"He got his first break when New Line Cinema Director Ted Witcher commissioned him to coach Larenz Tate in the romantic drama ""Love Jones"" which went on to garner a Sundance Film Festival Award and three NAACP Image Awards. While filming in Chicago, Yusef additionally made a cameo as a guest spoken word artist. In 2007 he collaborated with Director Frey Hoffman (Kanye West's ""Jesus Walks,"" Sa-Ra' featuring Erykah Badu and Talib Kweli ""Feel the Bass"") for the film adaptation of Yusef's poem ""Hollywood Jerome."" The two contemporaries previously joined forces for Yusef's 2005 music video ""Wouldn't You Like to Ride"" featuring Kanye West and Common. Their film ""The Untimely Demise of Hollywood Jerome"" presents a gritty street drama, chronicling the tale of a 14-year-old South Side gang member who idolizes classic Hollywood gangsters like the archetypical Scarface and Godfather. Yusef and Hoffman's film openly confronts pop culture's misrepresentation and glorification of gang warfare. The film culminates in the protagonist caught up in a police stand-off on the opposite side of town. Cameos include Kanye West and Twista.

The segment also featured artists including Malcolm Jamal Warner and legendary hip hop icon Rakim. Yusef appeared as himself in the 2005 VH-1 Television Series ""Driven,"" a documentary surrounding the life of friend Kanye West, also featuring appearances from Common, Damon Dash, Jermaine Dupri, Jay-Z, Ludacris and Russell Simmons. He additionally made guest appearances on ABC Worldwide News, WGN Morning News, CLTV's Garrard McClendon Live!, BET's Rap City and MTV's Hip-Hop Week.
