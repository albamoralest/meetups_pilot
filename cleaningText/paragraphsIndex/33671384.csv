"At age 15, Joe Ghost began DJing in nightclubs in his hometown of Toronto, Ontario. He first played an urban style format, and was drawn into electronic music when he first heard ""Groove In You"" by fellow Canadian producer Dave Armstrong (Steve Angello also co-produced) . In 2009 at Age 22, Joe Ghost began to experiment with production using Ableton, and re-created  songs he liked. In 2010 he released his first single on PBR recordings called ""At Night"", which included a remix from Dutch producers Bassjackers. ""At Night"" hit the top 10 on Beatport, and was also featured in DJ Chuckies Dirty Dutch Radio Show which aired on National Radio ""FG"" . Later that year Joe Ghost introduced his new direction in music with a Dutch/electro style remix for Stromae called ""Te Quiero"". Although ""Te Quiero"" was never an official release Stromae and Universal Records both supported the release.  In May 2011 he released an electro inspired set of songs ""I Just Came"" which peaked at #4 on Beatport, and ""I Hear You Talking"" (August 2011) which also hit Beatport's top 10.
