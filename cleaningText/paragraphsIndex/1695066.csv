"Hinojos was born in Los Angeles. He met future bandmate Omar Rodríguez-López at the age of 13 in El Paso, Texas and apparently introduced Omar to another close friend and collaborator Cedric Bixler-Zavala. Rodriguez-Lopez and Bixler-Zavala would later ask him to join At the Drive-In after some significant member changes in 1996, making him a part of the band's most successful and well-known line up.  After At the Drive-In took an indefinite hiatus in 2001, Hinojos, along with fellow ATDI members Jim Ward and Tony Hajjar, formed the band Sparta.

"Hinojos left Sparta in 2005, quoted as saying, ""My time with Sparta has run its course, and simply wasn't fun anymore."" A few days later, it was announced that he had joined The Mars Volta, where he took up the role of 2nd guitar in addition to 'sound manipulator' role (previously occupied by Jim Ward's cousin Jeremy). In February 2009 at the 51st annual Grammy Awards, Hinojos, along with fellow Mars Volta bandmates was awarded the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for the song ""Wax Simulacra"", from the album ""The Bedlam in Goliath"". Hinojos left The Mars Volta later in 2009 after being asked by Rodriguez-Lopez, in order to strip the band's sound down for their album ""Octahedron"".
