"Wolfgang Flür (born 17 July 1947) is a German musician, best known for playing percussion in the electronic group Kraftwerk from 1973 to 1987. Flür claims that he invented the electric drums the group used throughout the 1970s.  However, patent records dispute this, citing Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter as the creators.

The book covers his youth, early career as a musician, sexual escapades, and some of his activity within Kraftwerk.
