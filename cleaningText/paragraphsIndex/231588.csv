"Peter-Lukas Graf (5 January 1929) is a Swiss flautist born in Zürich, Switzerland. He was a pupil of André Jaunet, and later attended the Paris Conservatoire, where he won first prize with Marcel Moyse and Roger Cortot. Besides playing the flute both in orchestras and as a soloist, he is a conductor, and spent several years exclusively as an orchestra and opera conductor. He is also a teacher, and has taught at the Basel Music Academy since 1973 and at the Music Academy Accademia Lorenzo Perosi in Biella. Graf played at James Galway's wedding in May 1972. In 2005 Graf received an honorary doctorate from the Academy of Music in Kraków.
