"Kenneth Edward London was born in Dreux, France to a military family, but lived in Syracuse, New York. He later moved to Nashville, Tennessee, working as a demo singer and session bass guitarist, playing for Kitty Wells and Red Sovine, among others. In 1991, London signed to RCA Records Nashville to release his debut album Do It Right and its single, ""If We Can't Do It Right"", which peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. Ken Rosenbaum of the Toledo Blade described the album as ""30 minutes of mediocrity,"" and an uncredited review in the Miami Herald called it ""sweeter than molasses dripping over a bowl of Fruit Loops [sic]. And just as repugnant."" The album was produced by Ronnie Rogers (who also wrote several of the songs on it) and Warren Peterson. Its only other single, ""Uninvited Memory,"" did not chart.
