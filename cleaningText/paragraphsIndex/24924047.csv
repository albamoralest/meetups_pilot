"Their first album, Possessed by Fire, is musically in the same vein as Into the Dark Past by the then-labelmates of Angel Dust. The second album Rising from the Sea is more influenced by Slayer due to the voice of Paul Arakaki, which is similar to that of Tom Araya. Soon after this album, the band broke up only to reform in the 2001 during the exhibition at Wacken Open Air. In 2009, Exumer released a one-track demo called ""Waking the Fire"". The band released their third album, Fire & Damnation, in April 2012, followed four years later by their fourth album, The Raging Tides. Their fifth album, Hostile Defiance, was released on 5 April 2019.
