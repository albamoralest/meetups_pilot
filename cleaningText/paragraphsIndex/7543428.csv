"She has participated in Melodifestivalen, the contest to select Sweden's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest, a total of 3 times. At the first Melodifestivalen 2007 semi-final on 3 February in Jönköping, Book's song ""Samba Sambero"" was the second song announced as a finalist. The song then went on and finished ninth and second last in the final, where it received one point. Her fourth participation would have been in 2016 with the song ""Himmel för två"" (Heaven for Two). However, her song was disqualified on 4 February 2016, two days before the semi-final because the song had already participated in the Moldovan national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2014.
