"Other popular artists Dorfsman has worked with include Björk, Paul Brady, Def Leppard, Bonnie Tyler, They Might Be Giants, Richie Sambora, and Tears for Fears. Dorfsman was born in Manhattan and grew up on Long Island. His career began at Electric Lady Studios in 1977, where he was trained by Eddie Kramer. After two years, he moved to Power Station Studios, where he became a staff engineer in 1979. His big break came in May, when he was assigned to take over for Bob Clearmountain, who had a prior commitment, on album #5 for Bruce Springsteen. One year and 60+ songs later, recording was finally completed for the double LP, ""The River.""In the last decade, Dorfsman has made his residence in the San Diego area of California.
