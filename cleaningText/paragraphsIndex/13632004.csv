"Greene was born in Beverly Hills and grew up in Los Angeles. He began studying classical music at age 5 but turned to folk music by high school. After entering the University of California, Berkeley, he joined the Coast Mountain Ramblers and later the Dry City Scat Band, led by guitarist David Lindley. Greene first attained prominence with Bill Monroe and the Bluegrass Boys in 1966 as one of Monroe's first ""northern"" band members. He then joined the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, recording with them on the 1967 album Garden of Joy. After playing briefly with the Blues Project, Greene joined Blues Project founder Andy Kulberg and Jim Roberts in forming the roots-fusion band Sea Train, which released its self-titled debut in 1969. The band's second self-titled album, released the next year under the newly-shortened name Seatrain, was produced by Beatles producer George Martin and included the hit song ""13 Questions"". By then, Earth Opera guitarist Peter Rowan had joined the band, which played a mix of rock, bluegrass, folk, and blues. Other bands Greene has been with, usually as a leader or co-leader, include:
