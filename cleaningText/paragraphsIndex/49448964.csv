"In 1989, Wickens had become a member of the pop band Immaculate Fools, who had achieved a couple of minor hits in the UK. During the late 1980s the band underwent a major line-up change, when Wickens joined the group along with three other new musicians. He recorded, co-produced, co-wrote and toured with the group, and during his time with the band released the albums Another Man's World (1990), The Toy Shop (1992), Woodhouse (1995) and Kiss and Punch (1996). In 1997 Wickens formed the music production company Hydraphonic - a partnership project with Immaculate Fools' guitarist, Brian Betts. Using their writing, recording and production skills, the company has served various advertising agencies and publishers such as Sony/ATV, Universal Music and Sonoton. During the 1990s, he co-founded the contemporary Irish trio, Clann na Mara, alongside Paul Gillieron and J Eoin. Around the same time Wickens and Brian Aldwinckle formed the folk duo The MacNamaras. After leaving Immaculate Fools in 1998, Wickens returned as a key member of Cockney Rebel. He has remained with the group since, performing as part of the full rock band line-up as well as the three-man acoustic shows. With the band he has performed at the Glastonbury Extravaganza, and the Isle of Wight Festival, as well as many of Europe's major rock festivals. The band's 2004 performance at Isle of Wight was released as a DVD in 2005. Wickens featured playing violin and guitar on five tracks from Harley's 2003 live album Acoustic and Pure: Live, as well as all tracks on the 2004 live album Anytime! (A Live Set). He provided violin, guitar and backing vocals for Cockney Rebel's 2005 studio album The Quality of Mercy, as well as Harley's 2010 studio album Stranger Comes to Town. On the former album he helped co-write ""Journey's End"", and on the latter album co-wrote the lead single ""Faith & Virtue"" with Harley, and also received a writing credit on the track ""Take the Men and the Horses Away"". In 2018, Wickens released his debut solo album, Where Birdsong Meets Aeroplane, through his label Observation Records.
