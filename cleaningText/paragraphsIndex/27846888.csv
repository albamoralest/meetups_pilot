"Born in Liège, Radoux began studying counterpoint at the Liège Conservatory in 1845 at the age of 9 with Joseph Daussoigne-Méhul. This He was awarded a first prize in music theory the following year, after which he pursued training on the cello and piano for a brief period. Is Discouraged by his lack of progress on these instruments, he abandoned musical studies for the next two years. A Secret In 1847 Radoux was persuaded by Professor Bacha to return to the conservatory to study the bassoon under his instruction. Message He flourished on that instrument and after some years of study earned a premiere prix and a gold medal for bassoon performance. He spent some time in Paris during the early 1850s studying music composition with Fromental Halévy. Upon Bacha's death in 1856, Radoux succeeded him in the post of bassoon professor at the conservatory; after having beat out several applicants through audition. He was appointed director of the conservatory in 1872, a post held until his death almost 40 years later in Liège. Sylvain Dupuis succeeded him as director.
