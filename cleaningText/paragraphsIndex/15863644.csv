"Milosavljević started composing as a teenager, on the lyrics of poems by famous poets. He composed the song ""Čuj kako jauče vetar"" (""Hear the Wind Howl""), on the lyrics by Dobriša Cesarić, and ""Pozna jesen"" (""Late Autumn""), on the lyrics by Vojislav Ilić. Milosavljević had his first public performance in September 1970, in a club in Niš, performing alone, playing acoustic guitar and harmonica.

In 1973, he appeared on Festival Omladina's Evening of Free Forms, as a replacement for previously announced Lutajuća Srca on a suggestion by the band members themselves. The appearance on the festival helped him appear in numerous shows, including Radio Belgrade show Veče uz radio (Evening by the Radio). In 1974, on Belgrade Spring Festival Lutajuća Srca performed Milosavljević's song ""Ta ulica je meni znana"" (""I Know that Street"", on lyrics from Sergei Yesenin's poem). In 1974, he wrote the music for a project by amateur theatre Treća polovina (Third Half). After an idea by the director Desimir Stanojević, Milosavljević made an agreement with the members of the band Dva Lustera (Two Chandeliers) to form a band which would perform during the play. The band consisted of Milosavljević (vocals), Goran Ljubisavljević (guitar), Predrag Branković (bass guitar), Nenad Tančić (drums) and Bratislav Stamenković (keyboards), while Nenad Milosavljević's brother Predrag sang backing vocals. The band had their first rehearsal on January 4, 1976.
