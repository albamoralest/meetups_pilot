"Chanmina was born in South Korea, to a Japanese father and Korean mother, and lived in Korea until she was three years old. As her mother is a professional ballerina, she spent her childhood traveling around Korea, Japan and the United States. Due to her mother's influence, Chanmina learned ballet and violin from a young age. In elementary school Chanmina was bullied for not being able to speak Japanese fluently. During this time in her life, she discovered the song ""Day by Day"" (2008) by Korean band Big Bang, and felt moved by the song, inspiring her to become a rapper. Chanmina originally planned to move to South Korea to become a K-Pop musician in her second year of high school, however her friend, female rapper Messhi, convinced her to stay in Japan. She first came to fame after participating in the 2016 Bazooka!!! Kōkōsei Rap Senshūken, a high school rap competition broadcast on BS Sky Perfect!, and her independently released debut single ""Miseinen"" (featuring Messhi on the track), managed to top iTunes Japan's hip-hop song rankings chart. Her first major label debut single ""Fxxker"" was released in 2017, followed by her debut album Miseinen (2017). In the same year, Chanmina released the extended play Chocolate, which was recorded in Los Angeles. The following year, Chanmina switched labels to Warner Music Japan. The title song from her second album Never Grow Up was used as the theme song for the Japanese drama Jigoku no Girlfriend and became a sleeper hit, reaching over 10 million views on YouTube eight months after the song's release, and receiving a gold certification for streaming from the RIAJ. In September 2021, Chanmina's song ""I'm a Pop"" was featured in the Netflix film Kate, leading the song to chart in the United States on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. Chanmina released her third studio album, Harenchi in October, featuring ""Voice Memo No. 5"", ""Picky"", ""Angel"" and ""Bijin""; songs she had released as singles or as leading tracks from extended plays in 2020 and 2021. It was announced in a video by All-Nippon News Network on January 14, 2022, that Chanmina will debut in South Korea in summer 2022.
