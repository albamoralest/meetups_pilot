"Mitchell describes seeing Eric Clapton perform the song ""Miss You"" from his 1986 album August at a Prince's Trust concert as 'the single defining moment that made me decide to put down the violin and pick up a guitar'. Influenced by guitarists such as Jeff Beck, Trevor Rabin and David Gilmour, Mitchell mainly sings and plays guitar, but is also a multi-instrumentalist. He is best known as the current frontman for British prog-pop band It Bites (having replaced original singer and guitarist Francis Dunnery in 2006). Mitchell has also played guitar for a number of other progressive rock bands including Arena, The Urbane, Kino, Frost*, and the John Wetton band. In 2008, Mitchell was drafted in to join A, playing bass in place of original bass player Daniel P. Carter to support The Wildhearts on their December UK tour, as well as a 10-date headline tour in 2009. In 2012, Mitchell toured with Martin Barre in his band ""New Day"", singing lead vocals on many songs by Jethro Tull. Mitchell is also a record producer and sound engineer at Outhouse Studios, a recording studio in Reading, UK, where he has recorded and produced music for a number of rock bands including Enter Shikari, You Me at Six, Lower Than Atlantis, Architects, The Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, Funeral for a Friend, My Passion, Exit Ten, I Divide, Ivyrise, Anavae, Touchstone, Your Demise and You and What Army. Mitchell's latest music project is a solo project called Lonely Robot, whose album Please Come Home was released on 23 February 2015. It features a number of guest artists including Peter Cox, Steve Hogarth, Jem Godfrey, Nik Kershaw, and British actor Lee Ingleby. The albums The Big Dream released in April 2017 and Under Stars (April 2019), followed.
