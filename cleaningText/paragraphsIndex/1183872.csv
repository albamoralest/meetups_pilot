"The piece of music for which Colombier was perhaps, most famous, was the piece Emmanuel, named after and written in memory of his young son, who died in his infancy.  It was used by the French television channel Antenne 2, alongside an 80 second animation known as Les Hommes Volants (The Flying Men), by Jean Michel Folon, to signal the beginning and end of their broadcast day between the years of 1975 and 1983.
