"After years as a duo and then a trio, Baldwin left Jedi Mind Tricks in 2011 and Violence Begets Violence would be their only album to not feature Stoupe production. Vinnie Paz stated in a blog on the JMT website that Stoupe had lacked interest in the group and decided to focus on other things in his career, such as his side groups, and that Stoupe would not be producing any of the tracks on the new JMT album. However, Stoupe returned to Jedi Mind Tricks in 2014 and Jus Allah left the group for the second time. Stoupe and Paz worked on a new album called The Thief and the Fallen, which was released on June 2, 2015. Stoupe's only full-length solo album Decalogue was released on March 31, 2009, under Babygrande Records. It featured a mixture of underground and popular rappers (for instance M.O.P.) performing over Stoupe's productions.
