"Born in Cornwall, Ontario, Burn grew up in Deep River, Ontario and became lead singer/keyboardist for the 1980s Canadian band Boys Brigade. Following the dissolution of that group, he turned towards music production and solo work. In 1988 Burn relocated to New Orleans where he would work with Daniel Lanois (known for his work with U2 & Peter Gabriel) on a number of projects. Their collaboration began with Burn playing keyboards and guitar on Lanois' solo debut record Acadie. Burn recorded again with Lanois for Bob Dylan on his acclaimed album Oh Mercy, and on Yellow Moon by The Neville Brothers and Living with the Law, which he co-produced for Chris Whitley. Burn produced projects with Blue Rodeo, Emmylou Harris (Red Dirt Girl, Stumble into Grace), Midnight Oil (Breathe), Patty Griffin, Crash Vegas (Red Earth) and Patti Smith (Gone Again).
