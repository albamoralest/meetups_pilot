"According to Gully, Matters ""didn't fit the values of the Young [brothers] oligarchy. ... He didn't really fit, had strong opinions and sensitivity, and played just what he liked."" Matters only gave one press interview following his sacking by AC/DC in 1975, to Fink for the book Bon: The Last Highway, in which he claimed that he was ""a bit lazy"" and ""a bit cranky"" but did not have enough money to eat: ""I didn’t have any food in my stomach. They [management] didn't give us any money to buy food or anything.""
