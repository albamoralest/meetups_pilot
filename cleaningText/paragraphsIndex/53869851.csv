"Ashton Dumar Norwill Simmonds was born on April 5, 1995, in the Scarborough district of Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Oshawa. He is the second eldest of four children to his mother Hollace and father Norwill Simmonds, a pastor and gospel singer who released his first album as a high school student in Jamaica. Caesar attended the Seventh-day Adventist Church and private school in Oshawa. He is of Bajan and Jamaican descent. Caesar grew up in church, singing before his father's congregation in Oshawa. He was raised listening to soul and gospel delivered through musicality and religion, even though his parents were cautious of temptations that came with music. Caesar longed for the city, which was an hour’s drive from his home. At the age of 17, Caesar was kicked out of the house after a fight with his father on the weekend of his high school graduation. He felt no choice but to pursue his calling as a musician. After leaving his home, he began doing gigs. The turning point of Caesar's career came in 2015, with the release of his second EP, Pilgrim's Paradise. In 2014, Caesar received widespread critical acclaim for his debut EP Praise Break, which was ranked No. 19 on the ""20 Best R&B Albums of 2014"" by Rolling Stone. His music is influenced by religion, which played a large role in his upbringing, as well as unrequited love. On August 25, 2017, Caesar released his debut album Freudian, which includes the singles ""Get You"", ""We Find Love"", and ""Blessed"". The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize. At the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, Caesar received two nominations for Best R&B Album and Best R&B Performance for ""Get You"". At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, Caesar won Best R&B Performance for his single ""Best Part"". On March 19, 2021, Caesar was also featured alongside American singer-songwriter Giveon on fellow Canadian singer Justin Bieber's single, ""Peaches"", from the latter's sixth studio album, Justice, which became his first chart-topping single on the US Billboard Hot 100.

"Caesar's music is influenced by soul and gospel. His music draws from his childhood experiences and integrates them with R&B and electronics, while his lyrics explore subjects of religion, philosophy and unrequited love. In his music, he often references concepts of philosophy. His singing voice reshapes itself on each track, often veering into a hushed, introspective lilting style. According to Caesar, ""In my religious surroundings growing up, the point is to be still, to direct as little attention to yourself as possible and instead, direct all attention to what you’re saying. Now, it’s kind of the opposite."" Caesar cites Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Beyoncé, and The Doors frontman Jim Morrison as musical and stylistic inspirations. Caesar works in close collaboration with producers Matthew Burnett and Jordan Evans, with whom he co-founded his independent label, Golden Child Recordings, and has co-produced almost all of his music with since 2015. Caesar is also part of an informal collaborative of Toronto-based musicians and songwriters that includes River Tiber, BadBadNotGood, and Charlotte Day Wilson, among others.

"In April 2018, Caesar retweeted and then deleted tweets from conservative Candace Owens. He noted that he did not want to ""martyr"" for the tweets and that people should hear opposing arguments. He later backtracked his comments. In March 2019, Caesar defended his friend Julieanna Goddard via an Instagram live stream. Goddard had been criticized for her insensitive comments on race, particularly those regarding black women. Caesar came to her defense, asking why some black people were ""being so mean,"" and called call out culture overly sensitive. His comments were received negatively by some on social media. Caesar later apologized for the way he gave his opinions, saying: ""I was talking down to you guys. I apologize for how I expressed my idea, [t]here was no one there to challenge my ideas. That’s also dangerous. That’s why it’s tyrannical... that is where I went wrong. I believe in what I said. A real man can admit when he’s wrong. I can admit when I’m wrong.""
