"Wilbur Harden (December 31, 1924 in Birmingham, Alabama â€“ June 10, 1969 in New York City) was an American jazz trumpeter, flugelhornist, and composer. Harden is best remembered for his recordings with saxophonists Yusef Lateef and John Coltrane, and with trombonist Curtis Fuller. One of the earliest jazz trumpeters to double on flugelhorn, he began his career with Roy Brown and Ivory Joe Hunter, before moving to Detroit in 1957 to play with Yusef Lateef's quintet. His music career ended in 1960 due to health problems.
