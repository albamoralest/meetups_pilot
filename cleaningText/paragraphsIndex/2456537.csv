" He is widely considered to be Vietnam's best songwriter. His music explores themes of love, loss, and anti-war sentiments during the Vietnam War, for which he was censored by both the southern Republic of Vietnam and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Many performing artists, most notably Khánh Ly, Trinh Vih Trinh (his younger sister), and some overseas singers such as Tuan Ngoc, Le Quyen, Le Thu, and Ngoc Lan, have gained popularity in their own right from covering Trịnh's songs.

"Trịnh Công Sơn wrote over 500 songs during the 1960s and 1970s. Sơn was influenced by the shrill demands of American anti-war protesters, which had been brought to Vietnam by none other than young American soldiers."" He became one of South Vietnam's notable singer-songwriters, after his first hit, Ướt mi (Tearing Lashes) in 1958. He was frequently under pressure from the government, which was displeased with the pacifist's lyrics of such songs as Ngủ đi con (Lullaby, about a mother grieving for her soldier son).

"In the song ""Mother's Legacy"" (Gia tài của mẹ), Trinh sings about the Vietnamese experience of the Vietnam War:  He laments that the 1,000 years of Vietnam's subjugation to Chinese imperial rule, the 100 years of subjugation to French colonial rule, and the ongoing civil war, together have left a sad legacy of graveyards, parched fields and burning houses.  He urges the children of Vietnam to remain true to their Vietnamese identity and overcome the dividing hatred, put an end to internecine fighting and the destruction of the country.

"Love is the single biggest recurring theme in Trinh's work. His love songs constitute the majority of the songs. Most of them are sad, conveying a sense of despondence and solitude as in ""Sương đêm"", ""Ướt mi"". Songs are either about loss as in ""Diểm xưa"", ""Biển nhớ"", or nostalgia: ""Tình xa"", ""Tình sầu"", ""Tình nhớ"", ""Em còn nhớ hay em đã quên"", ""Hoa vàng mấy độ"".  Other songs, additionally carry philosophical messages from a man to his lover: ""Cỏ xót xa đưa"", ""Gọi tên bốn mùa"", ""Mưa hồng"".  The style is sly, simple, suitable to be rendered in Slow, Blues or Boston. The lyrics are overwhelmingly poetic, candid and yet deeply poignant,  oftentimes hinting elements of symbolism and surrealism.
