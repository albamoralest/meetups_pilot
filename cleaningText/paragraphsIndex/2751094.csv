"From the early 1980s Binder led quartets and quintets that appeared at festivals in Europe. He performed and recorded with the free-jazz musician György Szabados in the middle of that decade and near its end played in duos with Theo Jörgensmann, Laszlo Sűle and others. Many of his frequent recordings from the early 1980s and into the 1990s have been reissued on Binder Music Manufactory, his own label. He is the head of the jazz department at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music in Budapest.
