"Born in Wonju, she studied at Ewha Womans University, the Conservatoire de Paris, and the Royal Conservatory of Brussels. She continued her education at the Manhattan School of Music. Lee endured hardships during the Japanese occupation and Korean War, but emerged to become one of the dominant forces in Korean music in the 20th century. She was one of the six founding members of the Korean Society of Women Composers and served as the first president for the organization. She is often called the ""Face and Mother of Korean Modern Music."" Her works have been performed internationally and are available as recordings. Young-Ja Lee's music combines elements from French, West African, Indonesian gamelan, and traditional Korean music, creating unusual intercultural compositions. She is also noted for her particular mixtures of Western and Korean music.
