"Founded in 1999 by vocalist Georgios Grigoriadis and drummer Mats Kurth, Coronatus released its debut single Von Engeln nur in 2002. In 2004, Grigoriadis left, and was replaced by not one but two singers, Carmen R. Schäfer and Viola Schuch. The permanent line-up was expanded in 2006 with the addition of guitarist Stefan Häfele, bassist Wolle Nillies and keyboardist Fabian Merkt.

"Chriz diAnno (bass) has played with the band in 2003, 2005–2006, and then again since 2007. Ada Flechtner left the band to devote full attention to her studies, but joined the German symphonic metal band Voices of Destiny in 2013, after their lead vocalist Maike Holzmann departed. Mid 2010, Natalia Kempin joined the band on the vocals and Dirk Baur joined the Band on Bass Guitar. On February 2, 2011, Natalia Kempin announced at her Facebook, that she leaves the band, due to different opinions about the band's music.

",6,== Musical style ==
"The band follows in a style influenced by established groups Nightwish and Epica. Their lyrics are in German, English and Latin, and their songs deal with life, interpersonal relationships, religion and death. Their musical style is melodic, rhythmic gothic metal with ""a liking to the Middle Ages genre: piano, flute, bagpipes and violin manifest the balancing act between medieval atmosphere and heavy metal sound"". Songs are performed by two female singers whose styles are very different.
