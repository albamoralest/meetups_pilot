"Chit Chat is the writer and host of the podcast series. As the name suggest, the show focuses on strange and odd stories of life inside the music industry. It ranges from absurd demands made by artist to untold stories of the creation of songs. At its core is story telling, stories gathered from years of personal research, much of which Chit Chat claims he cataloged from “a thousand drunken backstage conversation”.

"Prior to Machine Gun Fellatio achieving success, Chit Chat provided scores for local adult films. According to Chit Chat: “We initially self-financed the band by doing porn soundtracks, which is funny and I don’t mind mentioning. It’s really hard to do porn. You think it’s going to be easy – you’re just going to get the wah pedal and knock it out, but you’ve pretty much got to write wall-to-wall sound and add dynamics for a 20-minute scene. It’s a lot of music.""
