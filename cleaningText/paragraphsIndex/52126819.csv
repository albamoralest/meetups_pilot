Recon went on for a few years until 1990. Before Recon disbanded, Ochoa joined the thrash metal band, Deliverance. and recorded on the most influential of the Deliverance discography, Weapons of Our Warfare in 1990 and What a Joke in 1991.

"Ochoa then went on to perform with Vengeance Rising as a live guitarist in 1992. The band only had two official members at that time, vocalist Roger Martinez and drummer Johnny Vasquez. He performed with them until the band disbanded later that year. In 1994, Ochoa seemingly reunited Recon, however, it appeared that nothing came of the reunion. The same year, Ochoa resurfaced with Mortification, the Australian death metal, on their album Primitive Rhythm Machine in 1995 as their guitarist and keyboardist. In 1996, Ochoa left the band.

"In 2001, Recon reunited for the second time for a performance at the Cornerstone Festival, with Ochoa returned, being one of three original members. In 2002, Ochoa formed a modern rock band with former Vengeance members, Larry Farkas and Glen Mancaruso, called S.A.L.T.. However, S.A.L.T. disbanded in 2004. Ochoa remained musically silent until 2010. In 2010, Ochoa played with Jimmy P. Brown II's side-project Jupiter VI. In 2013, Ochoa formed a supergroup with Rey Parra, Johnny Gonzales, and Todd Libby. Ochoa later on re-joined Deliverance several years later in 2014 with Victor Macias and Jim Chaffin.
