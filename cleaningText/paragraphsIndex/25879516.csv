",1,== Biography ==
"Dividing his youth between Memphis and Nashville, Street Symphony was compelled to pursue a career in music after watching an Outkast concert. With roommates owning equipment, the Sean Combs-influenced entrepreneur began making beats by fiddling with the turntables and drum machines through the night in his Middle Tennessee State University dorm. At school, Street juggled prospects of a bountiful career in Electrical Engineering with his visions of music stardom. In the end, he switched majors, formed a notable area Hip-Hop group Player Way with best friends Mike Sean and Lonnel Matthews and went all in. Through performing at college parties, Street Symphony & Player Way garnered respect and fans on campus, as well as surrounding areas. People took notice, ranging from Street's early mentor Carlos ""6 July"" Broady, to NBA champion superstar Gary Payton, who signed the producer to his Rock Solid imprint in 2005. It was there that Street Symphony acquainted himself with big recording studios, honing his original sounding repertoire of beats with the likes of Yo Gotti and Starlito, who were flirting with a Cash Money Records deal. Overnight sessions, traveling, and a tireless hustle gave Street Symphony a director's chair in the action, as he refined his multi-genre, unique style of music.
",2,== Biography ==
"Solidifying his presence in Tennessee, Street Symphony took interest in the Houston hustle. As artists like Paul Wall, Chamillionaire, and Mike Jones were reaching gold and platinum, Street remembered thinking, ""Let me catch this wave."" As he slept on his H-Town friend's floor, worked a day-job, and devoted off hours to his craft, he networked to shop his tracks to any artists he could reach. ""In the evenings, I'd get out and hustle. I'd go to Guitar Center, in the DJ room, and play my beats so everyone could hear."" Local artists took interest, as well as stars like Lil' Keke of the Screwed Up Click.

"After finding success in Houston, Street Symphony followed Rap's next wave to Atlanta. It was there that he connected with Ludacris's label Disturbing tha Peace working with I-20, Dolla Boy of Playaz Circle & Luda himself. In 2009 he reconnected with friend and former college classmate, Lecrae. With a label, Reach Records behind him, Lecrae hoped to expand his audience and accessibility, attaching the touted-Christian Rap star with music that legitimized his careful message. First contributing to Lecrae's Rehab album, Street Symphony's knowledge and sound attracted his longtime friend and the Reach Records' brass to want him on board. As their flagship artist was kicking down mainstream doors, Street had a musical style and a Rolodex that functioned as a key to the industry's doors. In the subsequent two years, Street Symphony would handle artist and repertoire and executive production of Lecrae's music, especially surrounding his acclaimed Church Clothes mixtape series. In their time together, Lecrae garnered a Top 3 debut, as Street Symphony earned his first GMA Dove Award and Grammy Award, for 2012's Gravity. Continuing his success with Lecrae, Esmond returned to the 2015 GRAMMY Awards, winning as co-writer & producer for Best Christian Contemporary Music Performance/Song, ""Messengers"". Following his achievements in the Christian Hip Hop subgenre with Lecrae, Street Symphony returned to the mainstream focusing on his Track Or Die production company. After affiliation from working together in The Playaz Circle days, 2 Chainz welcomed Street Symphony to the studio to assist in crafting the EP, Freebaseâ€”including video single ""Trap Back."" Additional frequent collaborators include: Yo Gotti, Starlito, Don Trip, Snootie Wild, and Tracy T.
