"Rosner got his training at State University of New York at Buffalo, New York. According to his own account, he ""learned practically nothing"" there. Rosner developed an individual style that fused elements of Renaissance music with the heightened drama and rich sonorities of late romanticism. He composed three operas, eight symphonies, six string quartets, chamber music and songs. Many of his compositions were influenced by his Jewish background, but also by Catholicism. Most of his music is available on recording.
