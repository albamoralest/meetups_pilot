"In 1981, Taco signed his first record contract with Polydor in West Germany for two record releases, whereon he released his first single, ""Puttin' On the Ritz"", which in 1982 was issued by RCA Records for US release.

The single was widely played throughout the US by late summer of 1983 eventually peaking at No. 4 in September 1983 on the Hot 100 as well as No. 1 on Cashbox. Although the single eventually earned him a Gold-certification for selling over one million copies, it was Taco's only Top 40 hit in the US. In 1983 and 1984, he toured extensively throughout Europe. While the single ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" topped the charts in Sweden and New Zealand, it entered the Top 5 in numerous countries including Norway, Austria, and Canada. His subsequent album, After Eight, was released in over 40 countries and managed to reach No. 4 in Norway, No. 5 in Canada, No. 11 in Austria, No. 17 in New Zealand, No. 23 in the United States, and No. 59 in Germany.  The album earned Taco a number of Gold certifications including one in Finland for selling over 25,000 copies. Taco's second single ""Singing in the Rain"" was a moderate success peaking at No. 49 in Germany, No. 46 in Canada, and No. 98 in the UK. He appeared as a guest on The Merv Griffin Show, Alan Thicke, Solid Gold, Good Morning America, a Bob Hope TV special, and many other TV shows while touring. Taco's follow-up album, Let's Face the Music, was recorded in 1984 for Polydor, which peaked at No. 58 in his home of West Germany and managed to enter the Top 100 in Canada peaking at No. 92. Taco continued to record, focusing mostly on the German market with albums Swing Classics/In the Mood of Glenn Miller in 1985 and Tell Me That You Like It in 1986 for Polydor.
