"Jason Sebastian Russo (born August 16, 1973, in Yonkers, New York) is an American rock musician. He was a member of Mercury Rev from 1994 to 2001, and rejoined in 2011 for the Don't Look Back concert series Deserter's Songs reunion tour. He founded the psychedelic rock band Hopewell in high school. Hopewell has since gone on hiatus. They released their fifth album, Good Good Desperation, on Tee Pee Records in 2009. He is also leader of the band Common Prayer. Common Prayer's debut record There Is A Mountain was released in the UK by Big Potato Records, a label founded in part by Slowdive's Neil Halstead. It was recorded on the site of the Truck Festival in Steventon, Oxfordshire, by Joe and Robin Bennett of Goldrush. Other players include Russo's brother, Justin Russo. In 2014, he began a new band called Guiding Light with the musician/filmmaker Tara Autovino. Their debut LP was released by Bleeding Gold Records (US) and Eggs In Aspic Records (UK) in late 2017. In 2018, while simultaneously recording their sophomore album, Guiding Light became one half of the band Pete International Airport, recording and touring the album Safer With The Wolves... (A Recordings). They also contributed, separately, remixes for the band's remix LP SFR WTH TH WLVS...RMX.

"""Jason Russo grew up in a religious household with two brothers, a sister and no TV. The son of a psychiatrist, he spent the better part of his youth in graveyards, woods and strip malls in upstate New York before music consumed much of his life. At the age of 19, Russo found himself touring alongside his brother Justin as bassist for critically acclaimed Mercury Rev during the band's peak, before moving on to focus entirely on his own eclectic psychedelic rock band Hopewell. - NY Post"".
