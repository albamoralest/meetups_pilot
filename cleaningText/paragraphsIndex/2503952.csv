"After guitarist Tim Agnello left Exodus in 1981, Holt joined the band and has been the main songwriter and the most senior member of the group ever since. Following Kirk Hammett's 1983 departure from Exodus to join Metallica, Holt kept the band going and for many years, he and Rick Hunolt were referred to as the Exodus' ""H-Team"" guitar players. Holt is the only member of Exodus who has played on every album.

"Outside of music, Holt enjoys foreign and period films. According to Holt, the track ""War Is my Shepherd"" on the album Tempo of the Damned is a treatise of America's ""pro-God"" and ""pro-war"" stance and how he feels the two beliefs are incompatible with each other. Holt endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election, stating, ""I used to have a lot of respect for McCain, but he realized after the dirty defeat that he suffered at the hands of George W. Bush in the South Carolina primary in the (2000) election that he can only get elected if he plays the Karl Rove tactic b.s. He's doing it. It's just one debunked lie after the other. He's the kind of guy who will tell you the sky is red, you look up and it's blue, and he won't admit he's wrong. He's playing dirty politics. Palin is just terrifying, the thought of this lady being a heart attack away from having the nuclear codes. She's crazy and she's dumb.""In the 2004 election, Holt vouched for John Kerry, but conceded that ""they're all dirty crooks, all politicians. But at least (Kerry) wasn't a coward. He fought in Vietnam whereas George W. Bush Jr. was a draft dodger.""In 2017, he referred to President Donald Trump as a ""serial liar"" and an ""embarrassment to this country, this world, and everyone living in it.""Holt is an atheist. In October 2017, he became a vegan. On December 17, 2018 his father Billie Charles Holt (born July 6, 1933) died. On March 18, 2020, Holt began exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19. By March 31, 2020, he had tested positive for the disease, although by then he had already recovered.
