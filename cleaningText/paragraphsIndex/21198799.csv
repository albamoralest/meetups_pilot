"Elias Mallin (born March 23, 1981, Phoenix, Arizona, United States) is an American musician, who played drums for metal/post-hardcore band Opiate for the Masses from 1999 until 2005, a band which he had formed with fellow students of the New School for the Arts and Academics. He was one of the founding members of My Darling Murder, a metal band formed with friends Andy Gerold (former touring bassist for Marilyn Manson) and Tim Kelleher (former touring bassist for Thirty Seconds to Mars). My Darling Murder broke up in 2006, according to a statement released by the band itself, and in the fall of that year, Mallin joined Kill Hannah on the road as their touring drummer.  He has since mid-2007 been featured in interviews, photo shoots, and press as a full member of Kill Hannah. Although a full-time member in Kill Hannah, Mallin has also been performing as the live drummer for Kesha since her Spring 2010 appearance on Saturday Night Live. He also performed as the hired gun in Hollywood Undead from late 2009â€“2010 before joining Kesha forever.
