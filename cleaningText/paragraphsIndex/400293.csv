"Levin helped to popularize the Chapman Stick and the NS upright bass. He also created ""funk fingers"", modified drumsticks that attach to the fingers of the player in order to strike the bass strings. Funk fingers achieve a sound which can be compared to the ""slap"" style of bass playing; this adds the distinctive percussive sound regularly attributed to funk bass playing. In 2011, Levin ranked # 2 behind John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin in the ""20 Most Underrated Bass Guitarists"" in Paste magazine. In July 2020, Levin was ranked #42 on the ""50 Greatest Bassists of All Time"" list by Rolling Stone magazine.

",11,== Biography == | === 1970s–1980s ===
"In his years with Gabriel, Levin developed two unique aspects of his playing: further advancement on the Chapman Stick, which he would later utilize heavily in King Crimson, and the development of funk fingers. First used on the song ""Big Time"", from Gabriel's 1986 So album, funk fingers are chopped off drumsticks used to hammer on the bass strings. Levin credits Gabriel with the concept and his tech at the time (Andy Moore) with actually making them workable.

While recording Peter Gabriel's first album, Levin became acquainted with guitarist Robert Fripp, and in 1978 played on Fripp's solo album, Exposure.
