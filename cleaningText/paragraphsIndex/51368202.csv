"Takatsuki was born in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. She also lived in Kansai for 15 years, but claimed she can't speak in Kansai dialect. Takatsuki has lived in Ibaraki, Osaka as well. After graduating from middle school, Takatsuki went to Himawari Theater Group where she studied acting. Takatsuki is the middle child and has two sisters. Takatsuki debuted as a singer in September 2012 with the release of the song ""Bonjō Cinderella no Shiruke no Aru Onegai"" (凡常シンデレラの汁気のあるお願い). Takatsuki is also an utaite (one who covers songs and uploads them in Niconico) under the name ""Kako"" (かあこ); one song she covered is Konomi Suzuki's ""This Game,"" which was used as the opening theme for the anime series No Game No Life. In 2015, Takatsuki began her career as a voice actress in the multimedia project Love Live! Sunshine!! as Hanamaru Kunikida and currently belongs to its group unit Aqours. Takatsuki also belongs to its sub-unit AZALEA along with Arisa Komiya and Nanaka Suwa. Takatsuki is nicknamed ""King"" by both fans and fellow Aqours members. However, she has since requested fans not to call her ""King"", and is now often referred to as ""Kinchan"" instead, as of September 2017.
