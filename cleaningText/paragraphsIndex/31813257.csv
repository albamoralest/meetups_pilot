"Mike Foyle was born in Southampton, England in October 1985. His father is a session musician and band member playing cello, piano, bass guitar and acoustic guitar. At the age of eight, Foyle  began learning to play the violin. By the age of 15 and after already leading the Southampton Youth Sinfonietta Orchestra, Foyle was appointed Concertmaster and first violinist for the Southampton Youth Concert Sinfonia Orchestra. Foyle devoted his higher education years to studying Music and graduated from De Montfort University in Leicester with a degree in Music Technology and Innovation in 2009. Preceding this he also gained a Higher National Diploma in Music Technology at Leicester College in 2006. During his final year at University, Foyle explored audio based brainwave entrainment and biofeedback combining musical textures with isochronic tones, monaural beats and binaural beats to create audio sessions which help induce sleep, gain physical motivation or aid creative inspiration.

"Later in 2005, Foyle released ""Love Theme Dusk"", a collaboration featuring the trance duo 'Signalrunners'. The track received regular support on BBC Radio 1 and from Armin van Buuren, who adopted the track as one of his signature playlist features, supporting it at most of his gigs over the following six months. ""Love Theme Dusk"" is considered a ""classic"" amongst electronic dance music fans today. Foyle began performing in clubs in 2006 after winning a DJ contest held by the promoters of Vaccine, an event brand based in London, England. He was invited to play at Turnmills nightclub (which has since been closed) in Farringdon for his first official DJ gig. Since then Foyle has toured around the world to play at festivals, clubs and private events.
