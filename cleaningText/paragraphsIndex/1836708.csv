"His career began in the 1960s, and his first single was the song ""Dzaghigner"" (Armenian: Ծաղիկներ), which quickly gained popularity among Lebanese and diaspora Armenians. Harmandian is considered a pioneer of the estradayin genre of Armenian music. Songs in the genre, such as Harmandian's own ""Nouné"" (Armenian: Նունէ) or ""Karoun Karoun"" (Armenian: Գարուն գարուն) are primarily sung in Armenian, and were influential in the formation of Armenian identity in Lebanon, the Middle East and throughout the Armenian diaspora. Harmandian has released 29 albums and around 400 songs and has received numerous awards, both abroad and in Armenia. During the Lebanese Civil War, Harmandian emigrated to the United States and resided in Los Angeles, CA.
