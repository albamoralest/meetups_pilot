"Connor is the eldest of six siblings born to Michael Lewe, a copywriter from New Orleans, and his wife Soraya Lewe-Tacke (née Gray), a former fashion model and homemaker of Scottish, Irish, and German descent, in Hamburg. She has four sisters, including Anna-Maria Lagerblom, the wife of German rapper Bushido, as well as Marisa, Sophia-Luisa, and Valentina; and one brother, Robin. Her maternal half-brothers Mick and Lex were born in 2008, Connor grew up listening to soul music, mostly influenced by her paternal grandfather, a former jazz and R&B pianist from New Orleans. A church choir provided her with her first experience in gospel music at the age of six. In 1989, the family relocated from Hamburg to Delmenhorst, where Connor attended the Max-Planck-Gymnasium (high school). She also enrolled at the local performing arts school, where she received dancing, singing, and acting lessons, which she paid for through waitressing and modelling jobs. After dropping out of school, she completed an internship with RTL Television. In 1997, Connor and her sister Anna-Maria were picked to sing with the backing choir during the performances of ""Earth Song"" and ""Heal the World"" at Michael Jackson's HIStory World Tour in Bremen, Germany. Overwhelmed by a personal meeting with Jackson at the end of the show, she began to record a number of demo tapes under the pseudonym Sarah Gray, including cover versions such as ""Silent Night"" and ""This Christmas"" as well as the local radio success ""Ula la Ula"". In 1998, her boyfriend Martin Scholz, member of the boy band Touché, arranged for Connor to sign a management deal with the group's manager. She subsequently served as their opening act for a Bremen concert in July 1998. Unhappy with her management though, Connor transitioned to the manager Carlo Vista and began work on the single ""This Christmas"" with the producers Oliver Hintz and Thomas Nöhre. It was released through Villa Records in 1999. Also that year, she provided the leading vocals for the German producer Marc van Linden's trance remix of the 1982 record ""Last Unicorn"", which reached number eighty-six on the German singles chart. In 2000, music manager George Glueck eventually signed her as Sarah Connor with the Sony subsidiary X-Cell Records.

"Connor fluctuated between Berlin, Hamburg, and Hanover to work on her R&B and hip hop-driven debut album, involving German music producers Bülent Aris, Rob Tyger and Kay Denar as well as international collaborators such as Eddie Martin and rapper TQ. Its release was preceded by the top five and top 20 hit singles ""Let's Get Back to Bed – Boy!"" and ""French Kissing"", respectively, as well as her breakthrough hit, the ballad ""From Sarah with Love"", which reached the top position in Germany, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland and raised Connor's fame all over Europe. Eventually released in November 2001, Green Eyed Soul generally had mixed reception from music critics, who declared it a mixed bag but considered it a solid career launcher. The album debuted at number two on the German albums chart, and charted within the top five in Austria, Finland and Switzerland, reaching gold status in Austria, Czechia, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland, while earning platinum certifications in Finland and Germany. Connor was subsequently awarded a Goldene Europa and won the Echo Music Prize for Best National Rock/Pop Female Artist, among three nominations.

"In fall 2005, Connor embarked on the Naughty but Nice concert tour. Compiling twenty-three dates in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, the tour concluded a month later. In December 2005, she released a holiday album named Christmas in My Heart. Containing a mix of traditional but contemporary English standards and re-written German songs in English language, both the album and its same-titled lead single reached number four on the charts. Eventually certified platinum by the IFPI, the album was re-released the following year, including the previously unreleased single ""The Best Side of Life"", another top four success.

Mainly made up of 1960s and 70s Motown covers, but also including two original songs, recording for the entire album took place at the former main building of the Berliner Rundfunk, where Connor was backed by a symphonic orchestra of forty-eight musicians. Upon its release, the album reached the top ten in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where it each reached gold status. Critics, again, gave Soulicious a mixed response, with CDStarts.de calling it ""a sterile soul adaption for The Dome stage"". Leading single ""The Impossible Dream (The Quest)"", which was featured in a publicity campaign for the comeback fight of German boxer Henry Maske, and ""Sexual Healing"", a duet with American singer Ne-Yo, reached the top ten and top twenty of the singles charts respectively. Heading into a new musical direction, Connor intensified work on her next original album with producers such as Remee, Thomas Troelsen and J. R. Rotem.
