"Roland began as a clarinetist, attending the Institute of Musical Art (later known as the Juilliard School) from 1937 to 1939. He started on xylophone in 1940 and began playing vibraphone in the middle of the decade, playing in jazz clubs in New York City. Influenced by the nascent bebop movement, Roland put together his own ensembles late in the decade, and in the 1950s he played with Oscar Pettiford (1951), George Shearing (1951–1953), Howard McGhee, and Artie Shaw and his Gramercy Five (1953–1954), Freddie Redd (1955), Mat Mathews (1956), and Aaron Sachs (1956).

During his 13-year ""gig"" at Monty Trainer's Bayshore Restaurant in Coconut Grove, he was credited for having trained many young musicians from the University of Miami. He worked steadfastly throughout his life in local clubs accompanied by bassists such as Lew Berryman and Mark Trail, and singers like Sandy Patton. He died of natural causes at the age of 89 in Palm Beach County Florida.
