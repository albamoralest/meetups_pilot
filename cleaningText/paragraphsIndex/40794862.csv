"Luiz Heitor made important contributions to the Brazilian culture, more specifically to the musicology field, by searching and systematizing national music and folklore. His was the first initiative of systematic editing of national authors’ works. He helped create the first Brazilian Journal of Musicology, Revista Brasileira de Música, in the 1934.

Before Luiz Heitor's accomplishments, Folklore was merely considered a secondary discipline. Heitor directed the research in the following Brazilian regions: Goiás State in 1942 (producing 64 documents and 19); Ceará State in 1943 (where he produced 262 documents and 75 recordings); Minas Gerais State in 1944 (280 documents and 100 recordings) and Rio Grande do Sul State in 1946 (293 documents and 116 recordings.)

"The participation of Luiz Heitor at UNESCO was gradual. First, he participated in a committee of specialists which outlined the humanities program of UNESCO. Luiz Heitor then participated as an intern, before finally receiving an invitation to work full-time in the organization. Later, he assumed a position as the International Music Counselor. The International Music Couselor is a professional organization which promotes the significance of music in the lives of people around the world. International Music Couselor's mission is to elevate the value the music in order to raise awareness of the particularities of the music of all countries. This organization intends to ensure that all music is shared and promoted. Even with his job with UNESCO, Heitor still worked with the administration of the “Centro de Pesquisas Folclóricas” in Brazil. The close relationship with Brazil allowed the material from “Centro de Pesquisa Folclórica” to be sent to Heitor, who would then add it to UNESCO cataloges. At the beginning of his work, Heitor catalogued all the songs they had in the collection by dividing amongst classical music, oriental music, and folk music. In the year 1949, Heitor published the first catalogue based on Chopin's music, which was important to the process of cataloguing world music.

Even though his constant effort and focus was Brazilian culture, he also participated of several achieval, research, and recording projects for music from other parts of the world.

",14,== Letters to Brazil ==
"The article ""My Memories of UNESCO"" dated from 1947 to 1965, written by Luiz Heitor, presents facts and experiences of the musicologist in his work UNESCO. This article highlights some information he wrote in letters sent to Brazil.
",15,== Letters to Brazil ==
"Regarding the artistic production, he related that very little things had been done at this time by UNESCO in the field of music. The only things they had in the official documents were a survey on the conditions of musical life in several countries, and a vague project regarding international discography to be submitted to the General Conference. The discography would, in the music area, the same than the colorful reproduction artworks which would be the essential part of UNESCO's program in the visual arts sector.
",16,== Letters to Brazil ==
"In the music section, that it was Luiz Heitor's job, it was still quite confused. According to his letters there was a program outlined, but there was a lack of ways to executed it. He noticed that there was international organizations, which were consolidated, destinated to the music and musician's interests. Since they organizations existed, he did not ignore them, and he tried to facilitate their relations with UNESCO. Further, he did not think it was necessary to create a new organization. So, he researched about them in order to know if they wanted to join each other in a kind of federation, under the auspices of UNESCO. This federation finally took the assignment of counsel: The International Music Council, which was destinated to organize, not only the organizations mentioned, but also the nationals organizations of each country which gathered in national Committees of Music. Moreover, they chose some people to represent them because of their titles and because of their undisputed projection in contemporary music life, at that time.
