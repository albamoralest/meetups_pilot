",21,== Biography == | === The concert at the Senate ===
"On December 21, 2008, Allevi directed ""I virtuosi Italiani"" symphony orchestra at the Christmas concert at Senate House. The audience included the likes of Giorgio Napolitano, the president of the Republic, and other high-ranking State officers. Along with two pieces by Giacomo Puccini, five compositions by Allevi himself were played. The concert was broadcast live on RAI1, the main national television channel, establishing his fame and success in the national music scene.
",22,== Biography == | === The concert at the Senate ===
"=== Criticism ===
",23,== Biography == | === Criticism ===
"The concert at the Senate hall inspired a strong debate on Allevi's actual talent: the celebrated violinist Uto Ughi strongly criticized the artist in an article that appeared in the newspaper La Stampa. Ughi  clearly felt ""offended as a musician"" and declared ""Allevi's success is the triumph of relativism"". Allevi retorted later in the same newspaper, accusing Ughi of ""defending the caste"", adding: ""my music speaks to people's hearts but its technical and rhythmical virtuosity requires highly-talented performers"". He noted that ""in music, it has always been difficult for new ideas to gain a hold, but later on, they became the rule to follow"". Allevi is often accused of being simply a mass media phenomenon, nothing but the ""result of a marketing strategy"", as Piero Maranghi, director of Classica, a television channel fully dedicated to classical music, said. Marcello Filotei, journalist at the Osservatore Romano notes that ""Allevi is the stereotyped representation of the composer, as anybody not familiar with concert halls expects him to be"". 
",24,== Biography == | === Criticism ===
"Allevi is also criticized for his conceit (he defines his music as a ""visionary project"" for ""establishing the basis for a new cultured contemporary music""). Other musicians plead Allevi's cause, recalling that ""his success gave a new birth to the piano, and encouraged many young to take piano lessons. In this debates I see only envy"" as the pianist Nazzareno Carusi said to Panorama. Italian piano player Loredana Brigandi has also been a highly outspoken critic of the artist.
