His extended works have been made available on various labels including: Island Def Jam, Tommy Boy Records, Universal Music, and Nervous Records (US). In addition to his musical career, Wray also hosted an evening pop/dance music radio show from the Spring of 2007 to early Winter 2010 on a Toronto terrestrial station. His musical works have received support by a variety of celebrity DJs around the globe, and have also been supported on various radio stations. His production for Natalia Safran's single ""All I Feel Is You"" was featured in the 2017 Sony Pictures motion picture Flatliners, starring Elliot Page, Diego Luna, and Nina Dobrev.
