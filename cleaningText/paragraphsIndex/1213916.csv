"Bridget St John (born Bridget Anne Hobbs; 4 October 1946 in Surrey, England) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist, best known for the three albums she recorded between 1969 and 1972 for John Peel's Dandelion record label. Peel produced her debut album, Ask Me No Questions. She also recorded a large number of BBC Radio and Peel sessions and toured regularly on the British college and festival circuit. St John appeared at leading folk venues in the UK, along with other folk and pop luminaries of the time such as Nick Drake, Paul Simon, and David Bowie, among others. In 1974 she was voted fifth most popular female singer in that year's Melody Maker readers poll. Blessed with a ""rich cello-like"" vocal style, she is also an accomplished guitar player who credits John Martyn and Michael Chapman as her ""musical brothers"".

"St John grew up in a musical household where her mother and sisters were all accomplished pianists. She took piano lessons at her mother's behest, but she did not get along with her teacher and quit when she was 11. After studying the viola for two years and then the trumpet for two years, St John bought a guitar with 20 pounds her grandmother gave her shortly before she finished high school. Her first performances were at Sheffield University in 1964–5, and her very first ""proper gig"" was at a pub in Rotherham. In 1967, St John spent three months in Aix-en-Provence as part of her French studies. During this period she met American singer-songwriter Robin Frederick.

"When it was time to return to England, St John travelled back to London with Robin Frederick. It was through Frederick that St John met John Martyn when he was living in Richmond. He was instrumental in getting St John's music out to a larger audience. In 1968, a mutual poet friend of theirs, Pete Roche, put St John in touch with John Peel for his ""Nightride"" radio show. St John's first recording sessions for Peel were recorded by Al Stewart in 1968 on Stewart's ReVox. The four songs she recorded were released on John Peel Presents Top Gear, Peel's 1969 compilation of BBC demos. The four songs were: ""The River"" (written by Martyn), ""Song To Keep You Company"" (written by St John), ""Night In The City"" (written by Joni Mitchell), and ""Lazarus"" (traditional). Peel and Clive Selwood formed Dandelion initially to release St John's music. St John's 1969 debut album for Dandelion, Ask Me No Questions, was produced by Peel and recorded in nine to ten hours. ""Curl Your Toes"" and ""Ask Me No Questions"" featured Martyn on second guitar. Richie Unterberger reviewing for AllMusic called the album ""music for wandering through meadows on overcast days"", while admitting that the songs are not as good as those of the musically similar Nick Drake. In 1970, St John recorded a vocal duet with Kevin Ayers on ""The Oyster and the Flying Fish"" for his Shooting at the Moon release. Her second album, Songs for the Gentle Man, was produced by Ron Geesin and released in 1971. This album was a significant step up from her debut, and contained string arrangements mostly by Geesin himself, particularly striking on the opening track ""A Day A Way"" and ""Seagull- Sunday."" Her third album Thank You For..., released in 1972, was even more ambitious and used more musicians with a folk-rock sound. The album was her last album for John Peel's Dandelion label, however, which folded due to its artists' lack of commercial success. St John's adventurous fourth album Jumblequeen, released through Chrysalis Records in 1974, garnered critical praise in Spare Rib.
