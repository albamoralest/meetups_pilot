"Miller was born in San Diego, California, but raised in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. As a student at Heritage High School in Littleton, he starred in high school productions as the Rooster in Annie and Noah in Two by Two. He was also a member of the Colorado Children's Chorale but only took music seriously in high school after being asked to audition for Annie due to the lack of male cast members with the ability to sing. Uninterested in his father's suggestion that he join the military, he went on to Oberlin Conservatory of Music, where he graduated in 1995 with degrees in Vocal Performance and Opera Theatre. Miller has been married to soprano Sarah Joy Miller, a member of the Three Graces, since 2009. They live in New York's financial district with their dog, Cosmo, a Maltese-Havanese mix.

"His best known work to date is considered to be his role as Rodolfo in Baz Luhrmann's 2002 version of Puccini's La Boheme. This show modernized the opera in an effort to lure young audiences to Broadway. Luhrmann staged a Broadway show as he did with Moulin Rouge! and his Romeo et Juliette. Luhrmann's version of La bohème premiered in Sydney ten years before it debuted on Broadway.  David was one of 3 Rodolfos in the original Broadway cast.
