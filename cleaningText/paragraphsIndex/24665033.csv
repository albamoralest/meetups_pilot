"Born in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, Phillip Wilson was a third generation musician. His grandfather, Ira Kimball, was a percussionist playing on the riverboats that traveled down the Mississippi from St Louis to New Orleans. His recording debut was with Sam Lazar, noted for having one of the first interracial bands in the St. Louis area. After moving to Chicago, Illinois, he became a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians AACM and performed with the Art Ensemble of Chicago. He joined up with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band in 1967 at a time when the band membership changed greatly, including an added horn section. He recorded three albums with the group. Wilson's song ""Love March"", written with Gene Dinwiddie, was performed at Woodstock and released in 1970 on the live album from the festival.
