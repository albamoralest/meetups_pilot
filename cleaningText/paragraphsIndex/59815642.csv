"The aspring young rapper,YungManny raps about many topics while using youth pop culture references, such as The Wiggles, Moana, Ms. Frizzle, and Stuart Little. In his music video for ""Bonfire Pt. 2,"" he uses a power drill in place of a gun, because he doesn't want to influence gun violence. He was introduced to Christianity from his young childhood friend Konya Nowlton. Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork describes YungManny's music as falling within DMV rap while still incorporating his own style. Pierre further explains that YungManny's style uses ""loud-mouthed aggression reminiscent of Prince George’s County"" similarly to Q Da Fool. HipHopDX reports that YungManny is ""helping pave the way to a sound of rap that many were skeptical of not too long ago."" Chris Richards of The Washington Post describes YungManny as ""immeasurably inventive.""
