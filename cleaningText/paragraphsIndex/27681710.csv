"After receiving his undergraduate degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1967 and J.D. from the University of Texas School of Law in 1970, Staehely was admitted to the Texas bar before moving to Los Angeles. In 1971, he replaced John Arliss (who briefly succeeded Mark Andes) as bassist in the already-established Spirit, touring with drummer Ed Cassidy and keyboardist John Locke as a trio while guitarist Randy California convalesced from a horse accident. Shortly thereafter, California departed the group and was replaced by Staehley's brother, John Christian Staehely. Under the aegis of producer David Briggs (best known for his lifelong collaboration with Neil Young), the new quartet recorded Feedback (1972), which showcased the bassist as the band's lead vocalist and principal songwriter.

"In an interview, Staley said, ""Law didn't lead me to music. Music delivered me to law. Like so many others, I played in bands while in high school (Austin, Texas), in university (The University of Texas) and in law school (The University of Texas School of Law). Unlike most others, I didn't practice law for almost ten years after graduating. I joined the group Spirit, wrote songs, recorded for Epic records and toured the world.""
