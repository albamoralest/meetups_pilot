"Carmichael was born to a Jewish family in Boulder, Colorado, United States. His father, Bob Carmichael, is a photographer, who also takes pictures during Maroon 5's tours. Jesse has a younger sister, Annie. He first started playing the guitar in junior high, rather than the keyboards (for which he is known in the band Maroon 5). Some time later, Carmichael, along with Adam Levine, Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick, started a band called Kara's Flowers and signed a recording contract with Reprise Records. In 1997, they released their debut (and only) album, The Fourth World. The album found little success and, after the demise of the group, Carmichael and Levine attended Five Towns College. While in college, Carmichael began to play the keyboards. However, two years later, Levine and Carmichael dropped out and headed back to California. The members of Kara's Flowers, along with guitarist James Valentine, went on to form Maroon 5 in 2001.

"On March 9, 2012, Carmichael was announced to take a break from playing in Maroon 5, for an undetermined amount of time to focus more on his studies of ""music and the healing arts"" (spiritual healing). However, on October 10, 2012, he confirmed that he would be returning to the band after they complete their Overexposed Tour. He rejoined in time for the band to record their fifth studio album V (2014).
