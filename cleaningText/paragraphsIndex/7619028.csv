"Robert Hazard (né Rimato, August 21, 1948 – August 5, 2008) was an American musician best known for composing and recording the song ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"", which Cyndi Lauper turned into a best-selling hit. He also composed the 1980s new wave and MTV songs ""Escalator of Life"" and ""Change Reaction"", which he performed with his band, Robert Hazard and the Heroes, which was popular in the Philadelphia club scene during the 1980s. These songs appeared on the five song EP Robert Hazard, released in 1982. Hazard's first major-label album, Wing of Fire, was released by RCA Records in January 1984.

"Hazard was the son of an opera singer. He grew up in Springfield Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Springfield High School in 1966.  He was profiled in a 1981 Rolling Stone article by Kurt Loder. In the piece, Loder describes Hazard's musical history as a musician ""... who started out as a Dylan-era folkie, then spent eight years singing country & western. 'I just love country music,' he explains — which of course explains nothing, least of all the two years he subsequently spent with a reggae band ... or his current electro-pop approach, which owes little to any of the above"". His final recordings were country albums, beginning with The Seventh Lake (2003) and continuing with Blue Mountain (2004). In 2007, Rykodisc signed Hazard and released his album, Troubadour.
