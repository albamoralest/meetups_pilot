",1,== Biography ==
"Fisher was born in Cologne, Germany. His parents were Max and Theodora Breitenbach. After visiting the United States in 1892, he immigrated in 1900, where he adopted the name Fred Fischer.  He founded the Fred Fischer Music Publishing Company in 1907. During World War I he changed his surname to Fisher to make it seem less Germanic. In 1914, Fred Fisher married Ana Fisher (née Davidovitch, later anglicized as Davis; born 1896).  Their children – Daniel (""Danny""; 1920–2001), Marvin (1916–1993), and Doris (1915–2003) – also wrote songs professionally. Fisher died in Manhattan, New York, and was interred at Maimonides Cemetery in Brooklyn.
