"Harry Lawrence ""Tiny"" Hill  (July 19, 1906 – December 13, 1971) was an American band leader of the Big Band era. During the height of his career Hill was billed as “America’s Biggest Bandleader” because of his weight of over 365 lb (166 kg). His signature song was ""Angry"", which he first recorded in 1939 on Columbia Records' Vocalion label.  He used sandpaper blocks and a güiro to generate a double shuffle ""beat that makes the listener itch to dance"".

"Hill was born in Sullivan Township (Moultrie County), Illinois.  His parents were William Fred Hill (1880-1915) and Osa Crowdson Ault (1890-1982).  His parents separated when he was seven years old and he went to live with an aunt. He was active in high school sports and was president of his senior class.  He graduated from Sullivan High School in 1924. Hill then attended Illinois State Normal School for two years.  Financial difficulties forced him to leave college to go to work.  He went to Detroit where he worked in a produce  warehouse.  After a series of short term jobs he ended up driving a team of mules for the Midwest Canning Company in Rochelle, Illinois.

Undeterred by the decline in the commercial appeal of the big band sound, Hill resolutely remained at the helm of the combo until his death in 1971. His final public performance was to a capacity audience in Emden, Illinois on July 17, 1971. The inscription on his tombstone reads: “Forgotten quickly by many, remembered forever by a few.”
