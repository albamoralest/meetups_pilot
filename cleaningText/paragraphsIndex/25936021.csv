She released one single, ""Gekka no Rasen"" (月華の螺旋), in 2007 under Hobi records label, before she was recruited by Lantis. Her first single with Lantis was ""Mind as Judgment"" in 2009. Since then, all her CDs have been released under Lantis. She is also signed with Sony Music Artists. Some of her songs were used as themes for some anime series, including Canaan, Future Diary, Mobile Suit Gundam AGE and BlazBlue Alter Memory. In 2009, Faylan contributed to a cover of the song ""Imagine (John Lennon song)"" in a group called ""Anison All-Stars"" in order to tackle world hunger. In 2016, Sato announced Faylan would be going on an extended hiatus due to an autoimmune disease. This hiatus ended the same year in October.
