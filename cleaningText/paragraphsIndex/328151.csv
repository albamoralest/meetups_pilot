At the age of five, his father died, and he and his mother moved from Rochester to Sacramento, California, to be closer to family. His mother remarried and Havok took on the surname of his stepfather (Marchand), and was enrolled in Catholic school through eighth grade. The family moved to Ukiah, California, in the late 1980s, where he graduated from Ukiah High School in 1993. Following high school, Havok attended University of California, Berkeley, as an English and Psychology double major. Following his sophomore year, his career with AFI took off and Havok did not return to the university.

"Glitterboy was a short-lived fashion line created by Havok. It was partly inspired by the 70s glam music scene, among other things. Clothing line Paden was released in 2007 and was available exclusively through Fred Segal clothing stores in California. Havok's second line, Zu Boutique, was launched in August 2008. The line was vegan and featured T-shirts with a limited pressing of 100 shirts per design. The line ""pays homage to pop culture, forward thinking, and hedonism"". A jewelry line was released in March 2009 in collaboration with PNUT Jewelry, the side project of Rusty Pistachio of punk band H2O fame. The jewelry was also limited, with only 10 to 90 pieces of each design made. In August 2009, in collaboration with Macbeth Footwear, Zu released a line of limited-edition shoes. Plagued by legal trouble, Zu Boutique vanished in 2012. Havok continues to collaborate with PNUT Jewelry.
