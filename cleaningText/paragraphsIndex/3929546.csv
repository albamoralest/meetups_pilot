"Luis María Frómeta Pereira was born in Pimentel, Duarte Province, Dominican Republic, on November 15, 1915. He would move with his family to San Francisco de Macorís some years later. The school he attended there had compulsory music lessons, so he learned much of his musical training there.

"Frómeta and his orchestra arrived in Venezuela in December 1937 with his orchestra to play regularly in a dance club in Caracas, the Roof Garden. The Santo Domingo Jazz Band did well, but the club owners didn't think the name would stick- so they had Frómeta change it to something more marketable. Frómeta went along, which got him barred from ever returning to his native Dominican Republic as Trujillo considered the change- ""Billo's Caracas Boys""- an insult.  Billo, Grandes Éxitos, a compilation album of the most famous songs of the Billo's Caracas Boys, was released in 1996.
