"In the early to mid-1990s, Sennett appeared in television shows primarily marketed toward teens. During this period he ended up playing two big supporting roles of Ronnie Pinsky on Salute Your Shorts and Joseph ""Joey the Rat"" Epstein on Boy Meets World. After Salute Your Shorts was canceled and his role on Boy Meets World was written off, Sennett switched gears and began to focus on music.

"In the early 1990s, when Sennett was in high school, he played drums in a band called the Caustic Truth. Future Rilo Kiley bassist Pierre De Reeder was his bandmate. Sennett was kicked out of the band, and the remaining members kept his drums. In 1996, he composed the score for the film Don's Plum. Lewis was the female lead in the film. Because of a lawsuit brought by stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, this film cannot be distributed in the United States or Canada. However, it was released in 2001 in Europe as a Region 2 DVD. This version contains Sennett's original score, as well as the song ""Go Ahead,"" written by Sennett and Jenny Lewis in 1996. The song was included on Rilo Kiley's first LP, Take-Offs and Landings (2001). Sennett has remained good friends with Maguire, Ethan Suplee, and Scott Bloom since the making of the film.  He had previously starred with Ben Savage and Suplee on Boy Meets World.
