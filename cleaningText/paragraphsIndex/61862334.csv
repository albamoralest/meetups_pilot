"Growing up in Kyoto, Cuushe spent time in Osaka before moving to Tokyo. She also spent extended periods of time in London and Berlin. She started making music in 2008. Her debut studio album, Red Rocket Telepathy, was released in 2009. In 2012, she released an EP, Girl You Know That I Am Here but the Dream. Her second studio album, Butterfly Case, was released in 2013. Patrick St. Michel of Pitchfork called it ""a captivating collection of dream pop."" In 2015, she released an EP, Night Lines. ""We Can't Stop"", a song from the EP, was used in the American dark comedy television series Search Party. In 2017, she became a victim of stalking and online sexual harassment. A fellow musician broke into her house and stole her unreleased recordings, musical equipment, and personal items such as clothes and photographs.

"In a 2012 interview with Dazed, Cuushe cited ""musician friends, movies, [and] sadness"" as her top 3 musical inspirations. Colin Joyce of Pitchfork wrote, ""The wispy-voiced Tokyo songwriter is nominally a dream-pop act, indulgent in the stirring static and hushed whispers that have become requisite for the genre.""
