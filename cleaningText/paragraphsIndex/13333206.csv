"Pokela and his wife, Marjatta Pokela, were widely credited with ushering in a revival in interest in Finnish folk music beginning in the 1950s. Their daughter, Eveliina Pokela, began performing with them in the 1960s. Pokela merged traditional Finnish folk music with contemporary sounds. The family's albums have also been released outside of Finland. Pokela taught kantele playing at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki and Kuopio until 1987. He was the founder of the academy's folk music department, where he was named a full professor in 1980. He is buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.
