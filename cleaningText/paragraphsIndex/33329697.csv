"Askill was born in Sydney in 1977. He has two brothers: Lorin Askill (a director, editor, photographer and artist) and Jordan Askill (a jewelry designer). He initially studied visual communication at the University of Technology Sydney in 1997 before moving to London, studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in 1999. Working freelance in London, he was involved in design work and film direction. Also during his time in London, he engaged in visual design work for Alexander McQueen. In 2001, Askill returned to Sydney and founded multimedia production and design studio Collider with his colleagues Andrew van der Westhuyzen and Sam Zalaiskalns. The studio has since expanded and presently has a large roster of staff and directors.

"In 2003, Askill wrote and directed the critically acclaimed, surreal short film We Have Decided Not To Die. Exhibited in various international film festivals, the film won prizes at the Clermont-Ferrand festival in France, Melbourne International in Australia, Brooklyn International and South by Southwest in the United States. The work is notable for its portrayal of the human body, ritual and use of visceral special effects. It was described by film critic Susan Shineberg in the Sydney Morning Herald as ""a breathtaking, burnished triptych, it evokes a surreal, ritualistic world whose characters appear to float free of space and time"".
