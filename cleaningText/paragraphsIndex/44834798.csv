"Everett is the youngest of six children born to Donn James and Frederica 'Freddie' Everett. Her siblings are Brinton, Brad, Alice, Brian and Brock.  As Everett stated on the podcast Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls, 1 Keith (episode 2: ""Moms and Stuff""): “I’m from Manhattan, Kansas - the little apple. And my dad was mayor at one point, and then so was my brother many years later. So we’re kinda like the Kennedys of Manhattan, Kansas."" Her father, who also served in the Kansas State House, died in 2007. Everett's mother was a music teacher and gave her a love of music. Her parents officially divorced when she was eight but had been living apart since her early years. Her father, an attorney, was not around much. Everett grew up a competitive swimmer and involved in both traditional and show choir. She attended college at Arizona State University on a full scholarship to study music and opera.  She worked in the restaurant business for 25 years before she was finally able to quit around the beginning of 2015.
