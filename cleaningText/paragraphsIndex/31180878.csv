The film tells the story of Aerosmith's journey to Japan shortly after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011. Tebo knew it would be a hard sell to Sony Music and Aerosmith management as the band was notorious for not releasing long form videos. Tebo shot the documentary footage while on tour with the band, combined with the live performances, and put the film together without telling anyone. He flew to Los Angeles and screened the film for Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, who insisted it immediately be put out for release.
