"Carney has been the art director for The Black Keys since their creation, designing all of the band's album art. In 2011, Carney won a Grammy for Best Recording Package for his work on The Black Keys' sixth studio album, Brothers. The album cover features a simple black backdrop with the text ""This is an album by the Black Keys. The name of this album is Brothers."" The group's label, Nonesuch, initially expressed confusion, but eventually gave the band, and Michael, their full support of the simplistic marketing. Inside the package, the album's disc was coated with a thermal film that changes colors (black and white) at different temperatures. Later that year, Carney was profiled in the New York Times article, ""The Incredible, Inevitable Shrinking Album Cover"" by David Browne. In 2011, The Black Keys released El Camino. The album cover, designed by Carney, features a Chrystler minivan instead of an El Camino.  According to Carney the look for the album cover was about capturing ""the spirit of doing it the wrong way."" A picture of a Chrysler minivan is printed on the album cover instead of an actual El Camino.
