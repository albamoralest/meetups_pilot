"Frasqueri identifies as bisexual and has stated such in a past interview and has also talked about how growing up near the queer community of New York City was an important part of her life. The early stages of Princess Nokia's musical career began through performing at gay clubs, as she gained popularity among the gay nightlife scene. She also identifies as a gender non-conforming person and uses both they/them and she/her pronouns. Frasqueri is a strong supporter of intersectional feminism, founding the Smart Girl Club with Milah Libin, a podcast where she discusses healthy living and urban feminism. She is a practictioner of Santería, and has shared their own experience with clairvoyance and spirituality that they infuse their music with. In 2017, Frasqueri punched a male concertgoer at Cambridge University who she said had been mouthing ""dirty obscenities"" at her. She later told the crowd that ""that's what you do when a white boy disrespects you"". Later that year, a video of a woman throwing hot soup in a man's face who was calling ""a group of teenage boys"" a racial slur whilst on a subway journey to Brooklyn surfaced. Frasqueri took responsibility for the incident, saying that ""everybody on the train backed [her] up"".
