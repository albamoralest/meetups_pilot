"In 1989, Peanut Butter Wolf met rapper Charizma. They became friends and started making music together. They made a name for themselves in San Jose and the Bay Area through their live shows and demo tapes. Charizma was shot dead in 1993. In 1996, Peanut Butter Wolf founded Stones Throw Records, which would release the duo's Big Shots in 2003. In 1999, Peanut Butter Wolf released My Vinyl Weighs a Ton. It peaked at number 44 on the UK Independent Albums Chart. In 2010, Jeff Weiss of Los Angeles Times called it ""a crate-digging classic that remains one of the seminal statements of the underground golden era.""
