"On July 28, 2016, OG Maco was in a near-fatal car crash. Maco suffered multiple skull fractures, cracked vertebrae, a broken orbital, heart palpitations, and almost lost his right eye. Despite earlier reports, OG Maco never lost his right eye. His eyesight only became extremely distorted, so he had to wear an eye-patch during his subsequent recovery. A few surgical procedures on OG Maco's right eye by his doctors has corrected the eyesight and has proven successful, and OG Maco is still able to see through it. Many earlier reports claimed doctors replaced his apparent blinded eye with a prosthetic one; although these reports were later found to be misinformation or false.
