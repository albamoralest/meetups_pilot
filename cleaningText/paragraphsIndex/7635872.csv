"Kieran Goss was born and raised in Mayobridge, County Down, Northern Ireland. He was just nine years old when he got his first guitar. Growing up in a big family with diverse musical tastes meant that early on he was hearing his brothers’ Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson records, his mother's Frank Sinatra records and his sisters’ Rolling Stones records. These varied influences gave Goss his own unique sound.

After completing his studies in Northern Ireland he worked as a street musician in Germany, France and New York and as a songwriter for other musicians. He recorded his first album, Brand New Star, in 1989. It contained the songs ""Brand New Star"" and ""Just Around The Corner,"" which came to the attention of Mary Black as she was preparing the album Babes in the Wood. She recorded both songs.
