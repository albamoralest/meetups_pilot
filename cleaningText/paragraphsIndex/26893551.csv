"Since Hoang's surname is a typical Vietnamese spelling of a Chinese name (Huang 黄), many of his fans assume that he is of Vietnamese descent. However, his family were ethnic Chinese from Guangdong Province, also known as Hoa, who later moved to England in the 1980s. There have been many comments and debate in his YouTube videos about his ethnicity. Hoang acknowledged his origin in an interview with The Sunday Times. Hoang is an avid Manchester United supporter.
