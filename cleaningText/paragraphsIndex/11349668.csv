"Kylee was born in Chandler, Arizona, to a Japanese mother and British American father. Her father inspired her to become a singer. She has a younger sister and a younger brother. When she was eleven years old, she passed an audition to perform the national anthem at the opening of an NBA game, earning a standing ovation. This performance earned her the interest of music producers, and she was signed onto the independent label RX-Records. Kylee attended Stoller Middle School in Portland, Oregon, until 2007, when she returned to Arizona. She then attended Hamilton High School and in 2016 graduated from Stanford University with a bachelor's degree. Kylee is a devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On October 17, 2008, her first single, ""Vacancy"", was released by RX-Records in the United States as a digital single.

On March 24, 2010, Kylee released her first major-label single under Sony Music Japan's label DefStar Records, titled ""Kimi ga Iru Kara"" (キミがいるから, ""Because You Are Here""), which was featured as the theme song to the 2010 film Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac, a Japan-America co-production in which she also gave a cameo performance. Her second major-label single, ""Missing/It's You"", was slated for release on July 7, 2010, with ""Missing"" being the second opening theme song to the Bones and Stan Lee anime Heroman.
