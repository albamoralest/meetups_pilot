"Mitropanos performed a North American Tour for the first time in 13 years since his last visit to the United States.  During his tour, he performed a concert on 1 July 2010 at Radio City Music Hall in front of a near capacity crowd.  He performed many of his famous songs that had been written in the earlier stages of his career as well as more recent songs which continue to be popular among Greeks, such as ""Roza"", ""Panta gelastoi"", ""Ta Ladadika"" and many more.  It was at this concert that he was accompanied by the Greek folk singer Margarita Zorbala, whose music is well known in their mutual homeland.  Mitropanos concluded his concert with a passionate performance of his famous song ""Alimono"", with all in attendance giving him a standing ovation as he walked off the stage.  As is commonplace among Greeks to show appreciation for a singer's performance at the conclusion of a concert, chants of ""kialo"" followed, meaning ""more"".
