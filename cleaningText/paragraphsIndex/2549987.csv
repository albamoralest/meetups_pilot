"Murdoch has been compared to the late British singer-songwriter Nick Drake. His first album Time Without Consequence was met with wide critical praise, gaining him five stars with Alternative Press as well as placing him on Rolling Stone's Top Ten Artists list. His newest release Towards the Sun is gathering higher praise still in both the US and in Europe. PopMatters, giving the record a 9/10 calls Murdoch's performance ""hauntingly beautiful"" and ""heartbreakingly lovely"". Q magazine in the UK give the record four stars with this to say: ""Acoustic troubadour makes stunning second outing. Anyone who harps on about how the songwriters of today don't match up to those of yesteryear should be directed to this remarkable second record.""
