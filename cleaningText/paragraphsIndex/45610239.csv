"Dupuis began playing music as a child, singing in choirs and playing piano. She joined a professional choir in middle school and toured internationally with it through high school. She learned to play guitar at the age of 13. When she was 14, she spent a year studying at Kent School, a private co-educational college preparatory school in Kent, Connecticut. She is a graduate of Shepaug Valley High School in Washington, Connecticut. She is also an alumna of Buck's Rock, an educational arts camp where she was both a student and an instructor of music, which later inspired Speedy Ortiz to fundraise for Girls Rock Camp. Dupuis attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for two years. She initially pursued dual degrees in mathematics and music before becoming interested in the school newspaper and deciding to eschew mathematics in favor of writing. After leaving MIT, she completed her schooling at Barnard College with a concentration on poetry. Before becoming a full-time musician, she worked as a freelance writer, taught writing courses, and got her MFA in poetry at University of Massachusetts Amherst.
