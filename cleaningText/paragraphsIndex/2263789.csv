"""The compositions had to be short, original, solemn, praising and looking forward to the future. They had to be harmonised in the usual four parts-soprano, alto, tenor and bass,"" said Kakoma in an interview. In July 1962, the committee chose Kakoma's composition. It had taken him a day to compose the music and write the lyrics for ""Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty"".
