"His playing on Cohen's Duende was described by critic John Fordham as ""somewhat reminiscent of a silky-toned old piano swinger such as the late Hank Jones"". His own album, I Asked You a Question, was a collaboration with Rejoicer, an ""Israeli beatmaker"". On it, Hershkovits plays piano, Fender Rhodes, synthesizers and clarinet, and adds vocals on two tracks, while Rejoicer plays drums and adds programming.
