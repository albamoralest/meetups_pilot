He arrived in Quebec City, Canada in 1940 on board the MS Sobieski, part of a convoy of 2,000 other ""prisoners of war"".

He studied with Richard Johnston, Robert Rosevear, Arnold Walter and Leo Smith, completing his B. Mus. in 1949. When Kallman noticed that Canadian composers were rarely covered in the curriculum, he began to gather information on Canadian composers and their published compositions, work that continued throughout his lifetime.

"Kallmann worked in the Toronto Music Library of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation from 1950 to 1970, becoming the library supervisor in 1962.  While there, he built an archive of some 1,000 Canadian compositions.  In 1960, he published A History of Music in Canada 1534–1914. In 1970, Kallmann became the head of the newly created music division of the National Library of Canada, now Library and Archives Canada.  He led the building and preserving of a broad collection of musical Canadiana: printed material, manuscripts and recordings.  With Gilles Potvin and Kenneth Winters, he edited the first edition of the Encyclopedia of Music in Canada, released in English in 1981 and in French in 1983.  At almost 1,100 pages, the English edition was the largest book that University of Toronto Press had published up to that time.  Kallmann retired from the library in 1987, and he and Potvin edited the second edition of the encyclopedia, released in 1992. With Clifford Ford, Elaine Keillor and others, Kallmann helped form the Canadian Musical Heritage Society, serving as its chair for much of its existence.
