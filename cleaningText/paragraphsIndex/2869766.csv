He has also been involved in the bands Clark, Snailhouse (with fellow Arcade Fire member Sarah Neufeld) and The New International Standards (with Arcade Fire members Richard Reed Parry and Tim Kingsbury). He recently played percussion on Owen Pallett's Heartland album (Pallett being a former member and regular contributor to Arcade Fire). As with other members of Arcade Fire, during live performances he often swaps instruments with other members of the band between songs, often taking on the role of an extra guitarist on certain songs.

"On 14 January 2016, Jeremy Gara announced he would release debut solo record 'Limn' on 11 March 2016 sharing the video for album track 'Divinity'. The album is a primarily composed of improvisation and is accompanied by artwork created by Gara. Reviewers have noted it fits in with the Montreal electronic scene and potentially has little crossover appeal. Gara has also occasionally filled in on drums on the television program Late Night with Seth Meyers.
