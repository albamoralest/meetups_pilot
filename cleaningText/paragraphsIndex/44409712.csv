"Kline was introduced to music by her family. She settled on guitar as her primary instrument of choice at seventh grade, after playing the piano and briefly the drums. Home-schooled for most of high school, she spent time by attending underground rock shows in New York and getting involved in the Westchester music scene. Kline  attended New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study for two years, and studied English and/or poetry. Kline found the school to be unaccommodating of her touring schedule, and dropped out. Kline and her brother Owen both appeared in the films The Anniversary Party (2001) and The Squid and the Whale (2005).
