"In 1995 Kosh and actor Susan Shearer formed Ten Worlds Entertainment. They directed the opening and closing sequences for the Emmy winning documentaries ""When The Lion Roars—The MGM Story"" and ""In Search of Dr. Seuss"" for Turner along with the 1992 through 1998 Billboard Awards telecasts for Fox TV. As production designers on the Showtime six-hour documentary, ""Sex and the Silver Screen"" with Raquel Welch, Kosh and Shearer recreated the look, lighting and film techniques of the 1960s back through the 1920s and teens. Ten Worlds was responsible for the title, set and production design for the CBS special ""60 Years of Life Magazine"" hosted by Candice Bergen. Ten Worlds also produced the elegant show logos and graphics for a series of TCM documentaries on glamorous film stars such as Louise Brooks, Rita Hayworth and Clara Bow. They designed the Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary Show, ""Glorious Technicolor"", hosted by Angela Lansbury, for TNT and the New Year's special, ""Life Remembers for CBS"". Ten Worlds achieved critical acclaim for their work on ""The Last Days of Kennedy and King"" for TBS and the ten-hour documentary ""100 Years −100 Movies"" for the America Film Institute and CBS. The Ten Worlds team designed ""California Connected"", a dynamic, weekly news program for PBS stations throughout California and ""The Barrymores"", a 90-minute special for A&E along with ""Masters of Production"" for PBS, chronicling the great Hollywood movie production designers.
",184,== Journey to the Ten Worlds ==
"In 2005, Kosh led Ten Worlds Entertainment into its evolution – becoming Ten Worlds Productions, Inc. Under its new name, it produced and directed a pilot for The History Channel, ""Declassified: The Rise and Fall of the Wall"", which sheds new light on the Berlin Wall. This pilot soon became a 13-part documentary series. The subjects of these documentaries focus on such figures as John Lennon, Fidel Castro, the Tet Offensive, Charles Lindbergh, Joseph Stalin and World War I.
",185,== Journey to the Ten Worlds ==
"Kosh and Ten Worlds Productions, Inc. are presently developing a rock doc feature on Apple Records and 2 animated series; one with comedian Lewis Black, and the other with Tea and Cheese from the UK.
