"Ali mixes ""in the box"" (without the use of analog gear) when working with certain audio effects, such as vocals. However, he credits a mixing console for his ""crispiness"". About using hardware, Ali says: ""If you have the gear, I suggest you use it. How I look at this way of mixing is I feel like you're inside the computer.""About 80% of his time spent mixing is in mono, which is a method he learned from Dr. Dre.
