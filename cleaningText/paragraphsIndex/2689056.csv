"The name of the band is derived from the Russ Meyer film Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!. Brent left the band in 1993. On April 21, 2007, Muscat circulated via MySpace an open invitation to Taime Downe and Greg Steele to reunite the classic Faster Pussycat lineup with him (Downe had been touring in a new incarnation of the group, featuring only himself from the original lineup). Brent's version of Faster Pussycat toured Europe in Spring 2007 with Kurt Frohlich replacing Taime on vocals along with Todd Kerns on guitar. After a short name dispute with Taime Downe, Brent dropped his claim and dissolved his incarnation of the band.
