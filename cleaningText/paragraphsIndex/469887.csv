"Foster was a keyboardist for the pop group Skylark, discovered by Eirik Wangberg. The band's song ""Wildflower"" was a top ten hit in 1973. When the group disbanded, Foster remained in Los Angeles and, together with Jay Graydon, he formed the band Airplay. In 1975, Foster played on George Harrison's album Extra Texture. He followed that up a year later by playing the Fender Rhodes and clavinet on Harrison's album Thirty Three & 1/3. In 1976 Foster joined Guthrie Thomas on Thomas' second Capitol Records album, Lies and Alibis, with Ringo Starr and a host of other performers. Foster was a major contributor to the 1979 Earth, Wind and Fire album I Am, as a studio player and arranger, and was a co-writer on six of the album's tracks, the most noteworthy being ""After the Love Has Gone"", for which Foster and his co-writers, Graydon and Bill Champlin, won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best R&B Song.

",9,== Career == | === 1971–1999 ===
"In 1985, Rolling Stone magazine named Foster the ""master of . . . bombastic pop kitsch"". That year, Foster composed the score for the film St. Elmo's Fire, including the instrumental ""Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire"", which hit No. 15 on the US pop charts. Another song from the film, ""St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)"", recorded by John Parr, hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 on September 7, 1985.

"Foster continued turning out occasional film scores, including the Michael J.

"In 1995, Foster signed a deal with Warner Brothers that enabled him to set up his own boutique label, 143 Records, as a joint venture with Warner. Foster gave responsibility for running the label to then-manager Brian Avnet. One of the label's first signings was a then-little known Irish folk-rock band, The Corrs, for whom he produced their debut album. By 1997, Foster had come to the realisation that, in the American market at least, ""logo labels"" like 143 were in a ""bad spot"" and, as a result, Foster sold the label back to Warner and became a senior vice president at the corporation. Foster, along with Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds, composed ""The Power of the Dream"", the official song of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Foster also produced the Diane Warren songs ""Un-Break My Heart"" sung by Toni Braxton, ""Because You Loved Me"" sung by Celine Dion, and ""Have You Ever?"" sung by Brandy.
