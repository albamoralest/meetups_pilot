"Mullins was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He cultivated an interest in music beginning in his days at Clarkston High School in Clarkston, Georgia (where he made the acquaintance of friend and mentor Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls). Later, he honed his craft in his college days at University of North Georgia (then known as North Georgia College) as a solo acoustic musician and bandmaster of the military marching band (Golden Eagle Band). He attended the University of North Georgia  on an Army ROTC scholarship with an intention of possibly pursuing a military career.  Although he quickly abandoned this notion in favor of songwriting, the contract nonetheless obliged him after graduation to serve a short term as an inactive infantry officer in the Individual Ready Reserve component of the U.S. Army Reserve. He served in an inactive status, reaching the rank of 1st lieutenant before fulfilling his service obligation and resigning honorably.

"Soon, he added a drummer (Mickey Hendrix) and bassist (Carlton Brown) to form the power pop trio billed as ""Shawn Eric Mullins with Twice Removed"", a combo that would help carry him to campus-wide and regional renown. Eventually the ""Twice Removed"" trio parted ways under amicable terms, and Mullins began using a variety of collaborative lineups while building his reputation as a solo artist.

"His critical breakthrough came when his song ""Lullaby"", from the album Soul's Core, became a radio and video hit. In the video for ""Lullaby"", directed by Roger Pistole, actress Dominique Swain appeared. His song, ""All in My Head"", featured on the sitcom Scrubs, was written in response to an e-mail sent by producers of the show searching for a theme song. Mullins wrote a demo version and sent it in within 24 hours. It wasn't selected as the theme song, but the demo version was used in a season one episode of the series.

"Another single, ""Shimmer"", was included on the soundtrack for Dawson's Creek and was a minor hit. ""Shimmer"" was also used in Australia as part of its promotional campaign during the 2000 Summer Olympics, and is still considered in Australia as the unofficial anthem of the games. To date he has yet to match the overwhelming commercial success of ""Lullaby"", which was also released as a live performance on the charity album Live in the X Lounge II in 1999. In early 2002, he formed the supergroup The Thorns with Matthew Sweet and Pete Droge.
