"His playing draws on many influences from different music styles like rockabilly, jazz, blues, country, Gypsy, punk, metal and classical.
",48,== Playing style ==
"At first, I tried to copy my favorite rockabilly licks, and then I gravitated deeper into the past researching old jazz, blues, country, and gypsy recordings. At the same time, I was listening to punk, metal, and studying classical music. I incorporate everything. I often use licks I learned from Romanian gypsy music when I play rockabilly, or throw in some New Orleans jazz licks when I play Balkan music. I do it all with a punk edge – my personal touch.
