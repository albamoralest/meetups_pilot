"Ueda was born in Toyama Prefecture on January 17, 1994. From an early age, she had an interest in performing, joining her school's theater club in elementary. While a member of her junior high school's theater club, she became interested in becoming a voice actress after interacting with a club member who wanted to pursue that profession. She decided to become a voice actor because, among other reasons, she wanted to change her personality. During her third year of high school, she applied for a voice acting audition only three days before the deadline of it. Ueda won the Second Class Grand Prix in an audition held by the agency 81 Produce in 2011, and formally joined the agency the following year. Her first role was in the anime series Inazuma Eleven: Chrono Stone.

The following year, she was cast as Meika Katai in Mikagura School Suite, Mikan Akemi in My Monster Secret, and Elena Arshavina in World Break: Aria of Curse for a Holy Swordsman.

In 2016, Ueda played the role of Hane Sakura, the protagonist of the anime series Bakuon!!; she and her co-stars performed the show's ending theme ""Buon! Buon! Ride On!!"" (ぶぉん! ぶぉん! らいど・おん!, Buon! Buon! Raido On!). She was also cast as Lily Shirogane in Aikatsu Stars!, Mira Yurisaki in Dimension W, Sophie Noelle in Kuromukuro, and Mallow in Pokémon: Sun & Moon. That same year, she made her debut as a singer, releasing the mini-album RefRain on December 21. In 2017, Ueda played the roles of Hiromi Maiharu in Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club and Shiori Shinomiya in Sakura Quest. She also made an appearance at New Jersey's AnimeNEXT event in April. In 2018, she played the roles of Arthur Pendragon in Märchen Mädchen and Akane Shinjō in SSSS. Gridman. She also released her first solo single ""Sleepland"" on February 7, 2018; the title track is used as the ending theme to Märchen Mädchen. In 2019, she was cast as Miyako Hoshino in Wataten!: An Angel Flew Down to Me and Gray in The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II: Rail Zeppelin Grace Note. In 2020, she voiced Shuka Karino in Darwin's Game.
