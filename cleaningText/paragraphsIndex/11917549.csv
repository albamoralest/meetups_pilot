"Dollshead was an alternative rock/electronic band. Its members were the California-born vocalist Sierra Swan and the bassist Graham Edwards from Scotland, who in 1997 began collaborating after an impromptu jam session at a Los Angeles studio. The band released their first and only album Frozen Charlotte in 1998. Critics have likened Dollshead's sound to that of the bands Garbage and Curve. At present the two members of the duo work separately on other musical projects: Sierra released a solo album in 2006 and Graham is a member of the music production team The Matrix.
