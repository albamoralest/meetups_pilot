"Vaughn grew up in outside Philadelphia in South Jersey. Raised in Mount Ephraim, New Jersey, he attended Audubon High School. He started playing the drums in a garage band when he was 12, then transitioned to the guitar. He used to go everyday after school to a local department store, where he would borrow the guitars and practice over chord sheets. Vaughn is a longtime fan of Rambler automobiles, and in 1988 recorded a song called ""El Rambler Dorado"" on his album Blows Your Mind. As a musician, he is perhaps best known for his album Rambler '65, for which he decided to ""cut out the middleman"" and recorded the entire album in his 1965 Rambler American. Vaughn turned his car into a makeshift studio by putting the recording equipment inside his car. Whether it was a gimmick or an act of showmanship, the music he created inside his car was, according to most reviews, ""timeless"" rock'n'roll. Now living in California, Vaughn works in film and television, and is noted for his work on That '70s Show, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Black Mask and Psycho Beach Party. 3rd Rock from the Sun also features a 1962 Rambler American convertible used by the show's main characters. He was a longtime resident of Collingswood.
