"Harry spent her early life living in Singapore and New York City as well as in the United Kingdom, and was raised under strict conservative family values – a vicar grandfather and mother in charge of a local Sunday school. Harry connected with singers such as Patti Smith and Janis Joplin – influences in both her youth and musical stylings. As she grew up, Harry became involved in the London music and social scene. She first experienced the London nightlife in her teens – earning her ‘Dirty’ tag along the way, and building a reputation for herself on the underground music scene before launching a music career of her own.

Harry. However, the album's release was not an easy process and complications ensued, resulting in a legal battle leading to Harry dropping her 'Dirty' tag and rebranding herself simply as Harry.
