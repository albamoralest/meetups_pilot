"In 1994, Kim decided that she wanted to take a break from being a recording artist to concentrate purely on song writing for other acts. As a result, she spent some time in Sweden working with songwriter Anders Bagge, co-founder of the Murlyn Music Group. She has also collaborated with Michael Garvin (""Never Give Up on A Good Thing"") as well as Sheppard Solomon (Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Imbruglia). Kim also worked closely with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) where she chaired the Ivor Novello Awards judges panel for Best Contemporary Song for over ten years, and previously the Best Song Musically and Lyrically for two years.
