"Miroslav Ilić (Serbian Cyrillic: Мирослав Илић; born 10 December 1950) is a popular Serbian folk singer-songwriter and philanthropist. He is known for his powerful vocals and emotional lyrics. With 25 albums, he is one of the best-selling performers in the history of Serbian music. Nicknamed Slavuj iz Mrčajevaca (The Nightingale from Mrčajevci), he has worked together with several popular Serbian musicians such as Lepa Brena. In recent times, he has spoken out against the new generation of Serbian music videos, claiming that music videos are becoming more and more sexually suggestive and inappropriate for general audiences.

"At 15 years of age, Ilić's first hit song was ""I loved the girl from the city"" (Serbian: Волео сам девојку из града / Voleo sam devojku iz grada) composed by Obren Pjevović, a fellow countryman of Ilić, and authored by Dobrica Erić. Pjevović first offered the song to Predrag Živković Tozovac and Predrag Gojković Cune, but they rejected it as non-commercial. In 1972, after several major record companies refused to release it, Pjevović and Ilić accidentally, on their way to the railway station in Belgrade, passed by the representative office of Diskos record company and decided to approach to them. Although this song was not corresponding to contemporary modern trends, a manager from Diskos decided to take a big personal risk and release the song. Very soon it became one of the biggest hit folk songs in Belgrade and Serbia.
