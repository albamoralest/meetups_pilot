"Lenine's career began at the age of 18, when he moved to Rio de Janeiro to compete in a music festival. In 1983, he released his first LP, Baque Solto, with partner Lula Queiroga. Ten years later, he released his second album, Olho de Peixe, with percussionist Marcos Suzano. Lenine's first solo record, O Dia em que Faremos Contato, was released in 1997, featuring a mixture of electronica, northeastern Brazilian rhythms and samba. Two years later, he released Na Pressão. In 2001, Falange Canibal was released. This album attracted international attention due to the appearance of the U.S. group Living Color performing with him on the song ""O Homem dos Olhos de Raios-X"". His next album In Cité (2004) was recorded live at the auditorium of the Cité de la Musique (City of Music) in Paris.
