"Rae began taking piano lessons at the age of five. During high school, he would seek out live musical opportunities: ""When I was in high school, you could get a gig playing jazz for a couple hours at places like Barnes and Noble. So my friends and I would play in little quartets, and each get paid in $25 gift cards, which translated to about two CDs. Later as a teenager, I spent some time on the Cuban jazz circuit in Los Angeles, which was a lot of fun.""Rae studied at USC Thornton School of Music in Southern California for two years, before dropping out to find full-time work as a musician: ""Shockingly, no one has ever passed me over for a gig because I didn't have a degree.""

"Rae's professional career began in 1999: ""Around the time I dropped out of music school in 1999, I met a group of more active musicians in LA and I started connecting and working with them. [...] One thing led to another and soon I was working full time doing session work, and then I got my first touring break with Alanis Morissette in 2001 when I was 21"".
