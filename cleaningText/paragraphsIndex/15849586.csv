"He was born in New York, United States. Moses played with Roland Kirk in 1964–65 while he was still a teenager. In 1966, he and Larry Coryell formed The Free Spirits, a jazz fusion ensemble, and from 1967 to 1969 he played in Gary Burton's quartet, including drumming for the Grammy-nominated album Gary Burton Quartet in Concert. He played on the landmark 1967 Burton album A Genuine Tong Funeral, but due to creative disputes with the album's composer Carla Bley the drummer was credited as ""Lonesome Dragon"". Moses and Bley would later reconcile and he became a vocal booster for her music.

"Moses also recorded with Burton in the 1970s, in addition to work with Dave Liebman/Open Sky, Pat Metheny, Mike Gibbs, Hal Galper, Gil Goldstein, Steve Swallow, Steve Kuhn/Sheila Jordan (from 1979 to 1982), George Gruntz, and Emily Remler (from 1983 to 1984).  In the early 1970s he was a member of Compost with Harold Vick, Jumma Santos, Jack Gregg and Jack DeJohnette. His first release was in 1968's Love Animal. His second release as a leader was 1973's Bittersuite in the Ozone.  His records for Gramavision in the 1980s were critically acclaimed. He is also the author of the drum method book Drum Wisdom. Moses performs alongside John Lockwood, Don Pate, and John Medeski with guitarist Tisziji Muñoz and teaches at New England Conservatory.
