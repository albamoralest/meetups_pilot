"In 1969 at Lefevre Sound Studios, Rodney was beginning his career as a recording engineer. One of his first engineering projects included recording a 45rpm single for a Washington, D.C. based gospel group called The Winstons.  The single for the group, titled ""Color Him Father"", went on to sell over 500,000 copies (RIAA certified gold) and won a Grammy Award the same year for Best R&B Song. The B-Side of the 7"" vinyl single was an up-tempo instrumental rendition of an older gospel music classic titled ""Amen Brother"". This song included a 4 bar drum solo played by Winstons drummer G.C. Coleman, which years later was to become known as the famous ""Amen Break"". It has now become one of the world's most sampled beats of all time and has been used by many artists including 2 Live Crew, N.W.A, Heavy D, Salt-N-Pepa, Scarface, Schoolly D, Nine Inch Nails, Oasis and Prodigy and has spawned entire musical genres such as Jungle and Acid.
