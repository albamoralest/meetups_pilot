"In 1998, Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight planned to launch many new rappers to come for the second generation of Death Row Records. Although he was incarcerated, he pushed rapper Top Dogg (also known as YGD) as his first new face making his television debut appearance in the video ""All About U"" on the 2Pac ""Greatest Hits"" album replacing Snoop Dogg. Top Dogg had generated a buzz from a hidden track on the ""Gang Related"" titled ""Goin Back To Cali"" aimed toward Biggie Smalls & Puff Daddy. The video, ""All About U,"" received heavy play and Suge followed in 1999 with Suge Knight Represents: Chronic 2000 album to introduce a brand new roster headed by Top Dogg, Tha Realest, and Soopafly, with Daz Dillinger as the veteran lead-producer.
