"Frank Hamilton (born August 3, 1934) is an American folk musician, collector of folk songs, and educator. He co-founded the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, Illinois. As a performer, he has recorded for several labels, including Folkways Records. He was a member of the folk group The Weavers in the early 1960s, and appeared at the first Newport Folk Festival in 1959. He was the house musician – playing guitar and other folk instruments – for Chicago's Gate of Horn, the nation's first folk music nightclub. After many years of teaching, playing and singing in California he married a third time, and with his wife relocated to Atlanta, where he performs on jazz guitar and co-founded the Frank Hamilton School in 2015.

"Hamilton was an only child. His father, Frank Strawn Hamilton, died before his son's birth; he had been a California socialist philosopher, genius street-corner orator, and mentor to Jack London. His mother, Judith Bley Strawn Hamilton, then married Phil Street, who had been a good friend of Hamilton's father; he encouraged his step-son's song-writing. That marriage ended when Frank was 12, and he never saw Street again. Classical music was what Hamilton, aka Strawn-Hamilton, first heard: he listened as his mother taught classical piano in their Los Angeles home. His mother – who changed her name from Gladys Antoinette to Judith after seeing the actress Judith Anderson perform – supplemented her income as a dance accompanist. As a teenager Hamilton developed an interest in the labor movement, playing jazz trombone with Local 47 at Club 47, and also with the Los Angeles City College jazz band. He was especially influenced by Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker, and starting learning guitar, studying jazz guitar with Sam Surace. He began learning and collecting folk songs, with a special interest in the music of the American South; he spent much of the late 1940s and early 1950s traveling there, performing in bars and on street corners. He returned to Los Angeles in 1953, and with Jack Elliott and Guy Carawan formed The Dusty Road Boys, who toured the Midwest. At Will Geer's artist colony in Topanga, California. he played with Woody Guthrie; he also met Bess Lomax Hawes there, absorbing her teaching methods.

"In 1956, at the Gate of Horn folksong nightclub in Oak Park, Illinois, Hamilton met Win Stracke, who took an interest in his teaching career. In Dawn Greening's dining room in Oak Park, Hamilton began teaching a group of 15 instrumentalists. In 1957 Hamilton, Stracke and Greening recruited teachers and an organizer, rented a space, and founded the Old Town School of Folk Music. Hamilton taught guitar and banjo and served as unofficial dean. Several hundred prospective students, performers, and educators attended the first session, and famous singers and folklorists – without compensation – began performing during the Second Half. Among them were Pete Seeger, Odetta, Studs Terkel, Doc Watson, Mahalia Jackson, Bill Monroe, the Weavers, and Jean Ritchie.

"Second Half, which follows the class lessons, is essential to the Old Town School method: both teachers and students sing and play together at their own level, and especially talented men and women are invited to perform. The School continues to promote the spontaneity, playful joyousness, improvisation, personal relationships, and progressive ideals which are hallmarks of Hamilton's teaching.

"After decades of living in California, in 1985 Hamilton married Mary Susan Doyle Smith; she became a supportive stepmother to his son Evan from an earlier marriage. Mary worked for Delta Airlines, and Hamilton relocated with her to Atlanta. She accompanied him on guitar, banjo, ukulele, and autoharp, and she also taught guitar. The occasion for the founding of the Frank Hamilton Folk School was Mary's sudden death in 2014. Bob Bakert, a friend of Frank's, volunteered to serve as Master of Ceremonies for the memorial concert for her, at Steve's Live Music in Sandy Springs. Concerned for Frank's well-being, and having heard of his interest in starting a second folk music school in Atlanta, Bakert suggested helping him achieve that goal; Hamilton responded positively. Together, they co-founded Frank Hamilton School in the fall of 2015 in Atlanta, but the school soon outgrew its first location; this had also occurred in Chicago. Under the leadership of Hamilton and Shelley Satonin-Hershkovits, the school now meets in eight-week sessions at the Oakhurst Baptist Church in Decatur. Satonin-Hershkovits teaches beginning guitar, and Hamilton teaches advanced guitar.
