"Dudziak was born in the Straconka, now a neighbourhood of Bielsko-Biała, Poland. She studied piano, but began to sing in the late 50s after hearing records by Ella Fitzgerald. Within a few years, she was one of the most popular jazz artists in her native country. She met and later married Michał Urbaniak. In the late 1960s, the couple began to tour overseas and in the 1970s settled in New York City. Dudziak customarily eschews words in favour of wordless vocalising that is far more adventurous than scat. Already gifted with a five-octave vocal range, Dudziak employs electronic devices to extend possibilities of her voice. She has frequently worked with leading contemporary musicians, including Archie Shepp and Lester Bowie, and was a member of the Vocal Summit group, with Jay Clayton, Jeanne Lee, Bobby McFerrin, Norma Winstone, Sting, and Lauren Newton. Dudziak has also co-operated and performed with her fellow Polish female jazz vocalist Grażyna Auguścik.

"In 2007, Dudziak's classic 1970s song ""Papaya"" saw a resurgence in popularity in the Philippines where it was regularly featured in the local noontime TV game show Pilipinas, Game Ka Na Ba? A favourite track for Filipino drag queens as lip-synch material in the '70s gay disco/bar scene, the song then saw a revival when a TV host danced to the tune, helping to spread the popularity of the song to Latin America and the US. The dance has then been featured in several news programs, including MSNBC, and Reuters. On 21 March 2008, the dance was featured on ABC's Good Morning America, where the hosts also danced to the song. Before the breakthrough of papaya dance in 2007, the song Papaya became a success in Brazil in 1970s as the opening theme of the original version telenovela Anjo Mau, produced by TV Globo in 1976.
