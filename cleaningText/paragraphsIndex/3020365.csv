"He was a member of the San Francisco-based, Latin-rock band Malo, who had a top twenty hit in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with ""Suavecito"" in 1972. He released two solo albums on Tomato Records, Jorge Santana and It's All About Love, featuring former Malo members. In the mid-1970s he played with the Fania All-Stars. The band, Malo, which means ""bad"" in Spanish, played a combination of laid-back fusion of jazz, rock and a variety of forms of Latin music, similar to the sound of Carlos Santana, his brother. The band's debut album, called ""Malo"" was released in 1972 and included the song ""Suavecito"". The song, which had a smooth, melodic sound, made it to No.18 on the Billboard singles chart, and became a popular song for fans of Latin rock. Malo played together for four years and produced four albums until they broke up and Santana embarked on a solo career and played with the New York-based band the Fania All-Stars. His distinctive guitar was a green Fender Stratocaster, acquired in the 1970s. After a long split, Santana toured with his brother, Carlos. The album Sacred Fire: Live in South America was recorded in Mexico City on this tour, featuring Jorge Santana, who played a personalized orange Paul Reed Smith guitar.
