"Barbara Carr was born in St Louis, Missouri, United States, and, like many blues musicians, she got her start in church, performing with her two sisters. At age 16, she formed the Comets, a band that performed cover tunes. Her break came when a brother-in-law working in Gaslight Square said bandleader Oliver Sain was looking for a female vocalist to replace Fontella Bass. Carr got the job, which eventually led to her first solo recording contract with Chess Records in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966. Carr and husband, Charles Carr, soon started their own record label, Bar-Car.  Their first recordings included Good Woman Go Bad and Street Woman. She continued to record intermittently and performed with Sain until 1972, when she temporarily retired to raise a family. After returning to perform with local bands around St Louis, she again began recording but with little success.  With her husband, she set up her own record label, Bar-Car, in 1982, and recorded a number of singles at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, which provided the basis for her first album, Good Woman Go Bad, in 1989.  A second album, Street Woman, followed in 1992.   In 1996, Carr signed with Ecko Records, which produced such songs as ""Footprints on the Ceiling"", ""The Bo Hawg Grind"", ""If You Can't Cut The Mustard"", ""The Right Kind Of Love"", and ""Bone Me Like You Own Me"".  While still with Ecko Records, Carr recorded ""What A Woman Wants"", ""Let A Real Woman Try"", ""Rainbow"", ""The Best Woman"", and ""Stroke It"".  Carr recorded eight albums with Ecko, including a best of compilation album, The Best of Barbara Carr.
