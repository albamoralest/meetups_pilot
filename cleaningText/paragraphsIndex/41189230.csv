"Clelia Iruzun was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She started playing by ear at the age of four years, subsequently beginning piano lessons with Maria Augusta Brasil da Silva and Dulce Vaz de Siqueira. From the age of seven she took part in several piano competitions and won many prizes. At 9 she entered the School of Music of the University of Rio de Janeiro where she studied with Anna Carolina Pereira da Silva and Arnaldo Cohen. From an early age she played for several pianists such as Jacques Klein and Nelson Freire and for composers Francisco Mignone and Arnaldo Rebello, both of whom dedicated works to Iruzun. She also had lessons with Ruth Cerrone and Miguel Proença, before winning a scholarship from the DAAD, Germany. She instead travelled to London where she studied with Maria Curcio, who awarded her a scholarship and later entered the Royal Academy of Music where she studied piano with Christopher Elton and conducting with Colin Metters. She graduated in 1988 with the Recital Diploma and several prizes. After leaving the Academy she studied with Noretta Conci and Merces de Silva Telles, a Brazilian pupil of Claudio Arrau. She also played for Stephen Kovacevich and Fou Ts’Ong. By then she had already won many International Competition prizes, including the Tunbridge Wells, the Paloma O'Shea International Piano Competition and Pilar Bayona in Zaragoza.
