Many colleagues and critics have concluded that Parry's music is that of a conventional and not strongly creative Englishman.,0,28,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"Delius said of him, ""How a man rolling in wealth, the lord of many acres & living off the fat of the land can write anything about Job beats me entirely"" and in 1948 Bax, who was unaware of Parry's radical politics, wrote, ""Parry, Stanford, Mackenzie – they were all three solid reputable citizens ... model husbands and fathers without a doubt, respected members of the most irreproachably Conservative clubs, and in Yeats's phrase had 'no strange friend'.",1,28,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"Of this I am sure.""",2,28,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
The view of Parry taken by Bax and Bernard Shaw was contradicted by his daughter Dorothea in 1956:,3,28,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"This fantastic legend about my father ... that he was conventional, a conservative squire, a sportsman, a churchman, and with no ""strange friend"" ...",0,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461

"He was a Radical, with a very strong bias against Conservatism ...",2,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
He was a free-thinker and did not go to my christening.,3,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"He never shot, not because he was against blood-sports, but felt out of touch and ill at ease in the company of those who enjoyed shooting parties.",4,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"His friends, apart from his schoolfriends, were mostly in the artistic and literary world ...",5,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
He was an ascetic and spent nothing on himself.,6,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"The puritanical vein in him is considered by some to spoil his music, as tending to lack of colour.",7,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"Far from its being an advantage to be the son of a Gloucestershire squire, my father's early life was a fight against prejudice.",8,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"His father thought music unsuitable as a profession, and the critics of music in the mid-nineteenth century showed no mercy to anyone they considered privileged.",9,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"My father was sensitive, and suffered from bouts of deep depression.",10,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
The extraordinary misinterpretation of him that exists should not persist.,11,29,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"In an analysis of Parry's compositional process, Michael Allis draws attention to a widely held but inaccurate belief that Parry was a facile composer who dashed off new works without effort.",0,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
He quotes the mid-20th century critics H C Colles and Eric Blom as equating Parry's supposed facility with superficiality.,1,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"Allis also quotes Parry's diary, which regularly recorded his difficulties in composition: ""struggled along with the Symphony"", ""thoroughly terrible and wearing grind over the revisions"", ""stuck fast"" and so on.",2,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"Parry himself is partly responsible for another belief about his music, that he was neither interested in nor good at orchestration.",3,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"In a lecture at the RCM he was censorious of Berlioz who, in Parry's view, disguised commonplace musical ideas by glittering orchestration: ""When divested of its amazingly variegated colour  the ideas themselves do not convince us or exert much fascination.""",4,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"Bax and others took this to mean that Parry (and Stanford and Mackenzie) ""regarded sensuous beauty of orchestral sound as not quite nice"".",5,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"In 2001, the American writers Nicholas Slonimsky and Laura Kuhn took the view: ""In his orchestral music, Parry played a significant role in the fostering of the British symphonic tradition.",6,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
"While his orchestral works owe much to the German Romanticists, particularly Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms, he nevertheless developed a personal style notable for its fine craftsmanship and mastery of diatonic writing.",7,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
His 5 [symphonies] reveal a growing assurance in handling large forms.,8,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461

"Dibble notes a more thoroughly absorbed Wagnerian influence in Blest Pair of Sirens, and points to the influence of Brahms on such works as the Piano Quartet in A flat (1879) and the Piano Trio in B minor (1884).",11,30,== Works == | === Music ===,144461
