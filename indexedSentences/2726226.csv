Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,1,47,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
One subject that was of great importance to Raschèr was his tonal concept.,0,48,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"He believed that when used in classical music, the saxophone should sound as its inventor, Adolphe Sax, had intended.",1,48,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"Upon inventing the instrument, Sax had specified the shape of the interior of the instrument's mouthpiece as being large and round.",2,48,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"All saxophone mouthpieces were made in this style until the 1940s, when the advent of big-band jazz made saxophonists experiment with different shapes of mouthpieces to get a louder and edgier sound.",3,48,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"Between 1940 and 1960, it became common for classical saxophonists to use narrow-chamber mouthpieces, which give the instrument a brighter and edgier sound.",0,49,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"Whenever he taught or lectured to saxophone players, Raschèr emphasized that the modern mouthpieces were not what Sax had intended, and the sound they produce, while useful to a jazz player who requires a loud penetrating sound, was not appropriate for use in classical music.",1,49,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"His students and other disciples felt that the desirable tone for a classical saxophone was a softer, rounder sound - a sound that can only be produced by a mouthpiece with a large, rounded interior (often referred to as an ""excavated chamber"").",2,49,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"His steadfast and irascible insistence in this area, while nearly all the world's classical saxophonists were moving to narrower mouthpieces (along with saxophones with a non-parabolically expanding bore) and a brighter tone, resulted in quarrels with, and alienation from, the majority of the classical saxophone world.",3,49,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"There were other ways in which his playing differed from the majority of classical saxophonists; these included his insistence on using the slap tongue as a pizzicato technique, and his use of flutter-tonguing.",4,49,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"By 1970, narrow-chambered mouthpieces had become nearly universally popular, and mouthpiece manufacturers ceased production of large-chambered mouthpieces.",0,50,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
This lack of supply meant that Raschèr's students had difficulty finding mouthpieces that would produce the tone they desired.,1,50,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"For a period of time the only large-chambered mouthpieces were ones that had been manufactured in the 1920s and 1930s, leading Raschèr students to search pawn shops and other sources of old instruments.",2,50,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226
"Raschèr responded to this lack of supply by engaging a manufacturer to make a ""Sigurd Raschèr brand"" mouthpiece, which was simply a virtual duplication of the mouthpieces that had been readily available from American saxophone manufacturers Buescher, Conn and others in the 1920s.",0,51,== Saxophone tone and the saxophone mouthpiece ==,2726226

Of special importance is Raschèr's emphasis on the extended range of the saxophone.,0,53,== Top tones ==,2726226
"As early as 1930 he demonstrated that an advanced player can achieve a range of four octaves on the saxophone, despite the fact that few players at that time ever played beyond the conventional range of two and a half octaves.",1,53,== Top tones ==,2726226
"This upper range became known as the ""altissimo register,"" but Raschèr himself refused to use that term, preferring to call them ""top tones.""",2,53,== Top tones ==,2726226
"A few players played above high F before 1940, including H. Benne Henton of the Conway Band c. 1911 (to high D), Dick Stabile, an early jazz artist (to high F), and Jascha Gurewitz, an early recitalist (to high F#).",0,54,== Top tones ==,2726226
Raschèr was vocal in encouraging composers to make use of this extended range.,0,55,== Top tones ==,2726226
"He was eager to demonstrate his command of these ""top tones,"" and argued that the use of these tones was a legitimate musical technique, not a trick or novelty.",1,55,== Top tones ==,2726226
"His book on this subject, Top-Tones for the Saxophone, was published in 1941 and remains highly regarded to this day.",2,55,== Top tones ==,2726226
"To better demonstrate that the technique of playing tones above high F had its basis in the natural overtone series of the saxophone, he had the Buescher factory create a custom instrument for him: a saxophone body with no tone holes at all.",0,56,== Top tones ==,2726226
A picture of this instrument is seen on the inside page of the Top Tones book.,1,56,== Top tones ==,2726226
"He demonstrated that it was possible to play at least 16 overtones on this instrument, and on a conventional saxophone as well, and claimed that diligent study of the overtone technique was the best way to gain a command of the extended range and improve over all tone quality.",2,56,== Top tones ==,2726226
"The extended range (altissimo register) was highly controversial throughout the middle of the 20th century, and Raschèr stirred the controversy among the classical saxophone community by insisting that the instrument's inventor, Adolphe Sax, had intended the instrument to be played in this manner.",0,57,== Top tones ==,2726226
Raschèr cited evidence that Sax had demonstrated a three-octave range (up to a high C) to composers in the 1840s.,1,57,== Top tones ==,2726226
"Despite the initial resistance on the part of the saxophone community to the altissimo register, it has since come to be an accepted technique, and is utilized by nearly all classical and jazz saxophonists.",0,58,== Top tones ==,2726226
"Despite its difficulty, it is now commonly taught to advanced high school and college students, and has become a required skill for any student who desires a degree in saxophone performance.",1,58,== Top tones ==,2726226
"During the earlier decades of his career, many saxophonists resisted and even ridiculed his pioneering work in extending the upward range of the instrument beyond two and a half octaves.",0,59,== Top tones ==,2726226
"Composers, however, were more inclined to embrace this expanded expressive capability that Mr. Raschèr had singularly fostered.",1,59,== Top tones ==,2726226
"By [1977], his lifelong commitment to the saxophone's high register, coupled with the momentum provided by so many composers who used it, had served to establish the extended range as an essential element of modern artistic saxophone performance.",2,59,== Top tones ==,2726226
