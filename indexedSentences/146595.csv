"Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution.",1,21,== Music ==,146595
This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.,2,21,== Music ==,146595
His youthful love for the fairy-tale element in Shakespeare prefigured his later expressions of Catholic liturgy.,0,22,== Music ==,146595
"Messiaen was not interested in depicting aspects of theology such as sin; rather he concentrated on the theology of joy, divine love and redemption.",1,22,== Music ==,146595
"Messiaen continually evolved new composition techniques, always integrating them into his existing musical style; his final works still retain the use of modes of limited transposition.",2,22,== Music ==,146595
For many commentators this continual development made every major work from the Quatuor onwards a conscious summation of all that Messiaen had composed up to that time.,3,22,== Music ==,146595
"However, very few of these major works lack new technical ideas—simple examples being the introduction of communicable language in Meditations, the invention of a new percussion instrument (the geophone) for Des canyons aux etoiles..., and the freedom from any synchronisation with the main pulse of individual parts in certain birdsong episodes of St. François d'Assise.",4,22,== Music ==,146595
"As well as discovering new techniques, Messiaen studied and absorbed foreign music, including Ancient Greek rhythms, Hindu rhythms (he encountered Śārṅgadeva's list of 120 rhythmic units, the deçî-tâlas), Balinese and Javanese Gamelan, birdsong, and Japanese music (see Example 1 for an instance of his use of ancient Greek and Hindu rhythms).",5,22,== Music ==,146595
"While he was instrumental in the academic exploration of his techniques (he compiled two treatises: the later one in five volumes was substantially complete when he died and was published posthumously), and was himself a master of music analysis, he considered the development and study of techniques a means to intellectual, aesthetic, and emotional ends.",6,22,== Music ==,146595

"The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (his form of  synaesthesia, the most common form, involved experiencing the associated colours in a non-visual form rather than perceiving them visually).",5,27,== Music == | === Colour ===,146595
