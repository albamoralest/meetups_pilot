"As a lifelong lover of classical music, especially as he heard ancient European organs on recordings - e.g. E. Power Biggs' The Art of the Organ and Helmut Walcha's of J.S. Bach's music on the Schnitger organ in Cappel, he became an apprentice under the two leading American tracker action pipe organ builders, Fritz Noack (1964–1966) and Charles Fisk (1966–1967) and then served as a journeyman (Geselle) with the Rudolph von Beckerath firm in Hamburg in 1967–68 to complete his training, especially in making reed pipes.",4,3,== Personal life and early training ==,2830032

"Since its introduction in 1978, the ""Bach"" temperament by Herbert Anton Kellner has become Brombaugh's standard tuning, though several of his organs are tuned in 1/4 Syntonic comma Meantone where their primary intention is for historically oriented performance of the organ literature older than that of Johann Sebastian Bach's.",2,6,== Organ building style ==,2830032
Many of his easily movable small positives have transposition capabilities to facilitate their playability at different pitches;  these (excepting his Op.,3,6,== Organ building style ==,2830032
2 that was made during his apprenticeship with Noack) are his only instruments tuned in Equal Temperament.,4,6,== Organ building style ==,2830032
"Although he has been interested to recover and use many of the lost concepts from the ancient organ-builders (e.g., the use of only mechanical key action), he also considers himself a builder of this time who is amenable to the use of the best current construction methods and the use of ideas necessary for the convenience required by organists of our time.",0,7,== Organ building style ==,2830032
"For example, his Opus 35 - an organ of 3,250 pipes, 3 manuals and pedal with 46 stops that was dedicated on Pentecost 2001 at the First Presbyterian Church in Springfield, Illinois - is a synthesis of historical and modern techniques.",1,7,== Organ building style ==,2830032

A few of Brombaugh's instruments have the mechanism needed so the organ's wind can be produced by foot pumping its bellows - the norm before electricity (or other energy sources) took over this rather boring job.,2,13,== Organ building style ==,2830032
"Beginning in 1970, development and use of an electronic ""tuning machine"" having a CRT display that can be set for any temperament and a reference pitch variable over a 4:5 ratio;  the device provides an  accuracy of 1/5 cent or 0.1 Hz and also has a filter settable to observe the various harmonics individually so all pipes of compound stops (such as the Mixtures and Cornets) may be very accurately tuned.",0,14,== Organ building style ==,2830032
