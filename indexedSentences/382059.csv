"McClary suggests that sonata form may be interpreted as sexist or misogynistic and imperialistic, and that, ""tonality itself – with its process of instilling expectations and subsequently withholding promised fulfillment until climax – is the principal musical means during the period from 1600 to 1900 for arousing and channeling desire.""",3,4,== Career ==,382059

McClary set the feminist arguments of her early book in a broader sociopolitical context with Conventional Wisdom (2000).,6,4,== Career ==,382059
"In it, she argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of ""purely musical"" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the classical canon most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.",7,4,== Career ==,382059

"In the January 1987 issue of Minnesota Composers Forum Newsletter, McClary wrote of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony:",0,11,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"The point of recapitulation in the first movement of the Ninth is one of the most horrifying moments in music, as the carefully prepared cadence is frustrated, damming up energy which finally explodes in the throttling murderous rage of a rapist incapable of attaining release.",0,12,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
This sentence elicited and continues to elicit a great range of responses.,0,13,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
McClary subsequently rephrased this passage in Feminine Endings:,1,13,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
'[...],0,14,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
[T]he point of recapitulation in the first movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony unleashes one of the most horrifyingly violent episodes in the history of music.,1,14,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
The problem Beethoven has constructed for this movement is that it seems to begin before the subject of the symphony has managed to achieve its identity.,2,14,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
(128),3,14,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"She goes on to conclude that ""The Ninth Symphony is probably our most compelling articulation in music of the contradictory impulses that have organized patriarchal culture since the Enlightenment"" (129).",0,15,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
The critiques of McClary discussed below refer primarily to the original version of the passage.,1,15,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Readers sympathetic to the passage may be connecting it to the opinion that Beethoven's music is in some way ""phallic"" or ""hegemonic,"" terms often used in modern feminist studies scholarship.",0,16,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"These readers may feel that to be able to enjoy Beethoven's music one must submit to or agree with the values expressed, or that it requires or forces upon the listener a mode or way of listening that is oppressive, and that these are overtly expressed, as rape, in the Ninth.",1,16,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Several commentators have objected to McClary's characterizations.,0,17,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059

"Leaving aside readers whose main interest is political, there are other reasons readers might take offense at McClary's sentence.",1,20,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"The passage could be construed as unfair to Beethoven if one assumes that the ""throttling murderous rapist's rage"" putatively expressed in the music is supposed to have come from Beethoven's own habitual thoughts and feelings, which McClary does not suggest.",2,20,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Scholars and historians have found no evidence that Beethoven ever committed a rape or harbored an intense urge to do so.,3,20,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Numerous musicological academics, however, have raised more serious and substantial objections to McClary's scholarship, including (but not limited to) her notorious remark about rape.",0,21,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Four examples are:,1,21,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Music theorist Pieter van den Toorn has complained that McClary's polemics negate the asocial autonomy of absolute music; he is concerned with Schenker-style formal analysis.,0,22,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Van den Toorn complains, for example, that ""Fanned by an aversion for male sexuality, which it depicts as something brutal and contemptible, irrelevancies are being read into the music.""",1,22,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Van den Toorn's complaint was rebutted by musicologist Ruth Solie.,2,22,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Van den Toorn responded with a book on these issues.,3,22,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Composer Elaine Barkin, in another extended critique, complained that ""McClary's voice tone, language, attitudes all too resoundingly perpetuate and reinstantiate those very 'patriarchal practices' she is deploring.""",0,23,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"McClary briefly dismissed Barkin's critique as ""a caricature.""",1,23,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Musicologist Paula Higgins, in another robust critique of McClary's work, has observed that ""one wonders ...",0,24,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"if [McClary] has not strategically co-opted feminism as an excuse for guerrilla attacks on the field.""",1,24,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Higgins complains of McClary's ""truculent verbal assaults on musicological straw men"", and observes that ""For all the hip culture critique imported from other fields, McClary has left the cobwebs of patriarchal musicological thought largely intact.""",2,24,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Higgins is also critical of McClary's citation practice as it concerns other scholars in the area of feminist musical criticism.,3,24,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Ethnomusicologist Henry Kingsbury has criticized McClary's inattention to the Friedrich Schiller poem set in the fourth movement of the Ninth Symphony; he also lists numerous works by Beethoven and Schubert that he says contradict McClary's claims regarding violence in Beethoven as well as her argument about the construction of gender in music.,0,25,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Another source of controversy is the possibility that McClary's passage trivializes the experience of rape victims by reducing it to mere metaphor.,1,25,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"Even readers sympathetic to criticism of Beethoven's music may find that pinpointing a vague, unintended colonial program as ""rape"" is inaccurate.",2,25,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
The pianist and critic Charles Rosen has also commented on the famous passage.,3,25,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"He avoids taking offense on any of the grounds mentioned above, and is willing to admit sexual metaphors to musical analysis.",4,25,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
Rosen's disagreement is simply with McClary's assessment of the music:,5,25,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"We have first her characterization of the moment of recapitulation in the first movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony:The phrase about the murderous rage of the rapist has since been withdrawn [as noted above], which indicates that McClary realized it posed a problem, but it has the great merit of recognizing that something extraordinary is taking place here, and McClary's metaphor of sexual violence is not a bad way to describe it.",0,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"The difficulty is that all metaphors oversimplify, like those entertaining little stories that music critics in the nineteenth century used to invent about works of music for an audience whose musical literacy was not too well developed.",1,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"I do not, myself, find the cadence frustrated or dammed up in any constricting sense, but only given a slightly deviant movement which briefly postpones total fulfillment.",2,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"To continue the sexual imagery, I cannot think that the rapist incapable of attaining release is an adequate analogue, but I hear the passage as if Beethoven had found a way of making an orgasm last for sixteen bars.",3,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"What causes the passage to be so shocking, indeed, is the power of sustaining over such a long phrase what we expect as a brief explosion.",4,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"To McClary's credit, it should be said that some kind of metaphorical description is called for, and even necessary, but I should like to suggest that none will be satisfactory or definitive.",5,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"McClary also notes that she ""can say something nice about Beethoven"", saying of his String Quartet, Op.",6,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"132, ""Few pieces offer so as vivid an image of shattered subjectivity the opening of Op.",7,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"132.""Writing over thirty years after its publication, McClary observed:",8,26,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
People often ask me if I regret having written this essay.,0,27,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"I have lived with the consequences for over thirty years, and no matter how much I publish on modal theory or Kaija Saariaho, I will always be identified with this sentence, nearly always taken out of context.",1,27,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
"I hasten to mention that I have taught a course on Beethoven quartets every other year since 1980; unless a student has googled me and asked about the controversy, no one in my classes would have any inkling of my presumed hatred of this composer.",2,27,== The Beethoven and rape controversy ==,382059
