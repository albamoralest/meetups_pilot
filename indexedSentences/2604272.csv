"Kurbas' work could only be mentioned again from the 1960s onwards, yet the overdue research was only begun in late 1980s, mostly in Ukraine.",2,17,== Posterity ==,2604272

"Some hagiographers claim that Kurbas was a genius (he was indeed multi-talented) who anticipated every development of the later 20th century theater (some of which he did, as for example in the work of Italian director Eugenio Barba's Odin Teatret).",4,17,== Posterity ==,2604272
Another important falsification is that Kurbas was not a communist.,5,17,== Posterity ==,2604272
