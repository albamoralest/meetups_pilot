"""""Master Chef"""" was declared contestant Akis Petretzikis and he remains unique since 2nd season of MasterChef Greece never ended.",4,41,== TV career ==,9548194
Eugenia's spontaneous reaction on winner announcement was never cut on editing and thus an urban slogan emerged: Θα καταρρεύσω i.e. I am about to collapse.,5,41,== TV career ==,9548194
She opted not to present either Junior version or 2nd season despite proposals for both.,6,41,== TV career ==,9548194
