"In two articles (which are a preparation for her doctoral dissertation), Thompson provided an extensively researched historiography of how Tregian's name became so closely associated with music and why it persists despite lack of evidence and presentation of new information.",1,11,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
The origins of the association appear to have begun with William Chappell.,2,11,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"Writing about the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book in 1855, he mentioned the name Tregian based on six ambiguous abbreviations and only one instance of the name actually spelled out (no. 315, the ""Pavana chromatica"" has a marginal note to ""Mrs Katherin Tregians Pauern""",3,11,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457

Musicologist William Barclay Squire elaborated on Chappell's random notes.,0,12,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"In 1889 for the article on ""Virginal music"" written for the first edition of George Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Squire provided biographies of both elder and younger Tregians and introduced the idea that the younger Tregian might have copied the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.",1,12,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457

Thompson quotes Squire:,3,12,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"If it were not for the dates of the younger Tregian's death and of the composition of Dr. Bull's 'Jewel' [1621], it might be conjectured that the MS was transcribed by the younger Tregian while a prisoner in the Fleet.",0,13,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457

Thompson then adds her own astute observation:,0,14,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457

Squire continued to elaborate upon his supposed Tregian connection for the 1899 publication of music from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book.,0,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
Recognizing that the John Bull piece was not the 1621 work removed the obstacle to hypothesizing that Tregian was the copyist.,1,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"In the introduction to the edition, Squire wrote ""...it may be conjectured with much plausibility that [the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book] was written by the younger Tregian to while away his time in prison.""",2,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"The editors added some scepticism, noting that handwriting samples would be needed to verify Tregian's handwriting.",3,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"Because of the wide distribution of this 1899 edition of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book due to reprints, Squire's strongest endorsement of Tregian has gained near-acceptance as fact.",4,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"In the second (1910) and third (1928) editions of Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Squire mitigated his view of Tregian's responsibility, retreating from the claim that he had copied the work, but believing that it was still associated with him.",5,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457

"The presence of two instances of the marking ""Treg"" in titles as well as ambiguous abbreviations—and noting that all these annotations are missing in other manuscript versions of these works—leads Thompson to find a slim basis for Squire's declaration of Tregian being the copyist in 1899, and no surprise that he later retreated from the claim.",8,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457
"In 1951, Bertram Schofield and Thurston Dart's article on the then newly purchased manuscript Egerton 3665 declared that manuscript to be in the same hand as the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book: ""The two hands are identical, even down to minute details of erasure, pagination, correction of mistakes and numbering of the content of the books.""",9,16,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Historiography ===,8893457

"Thompson identifies two features which can reveal music script variations between different hands: the shape of white notes (that is, half notes) with stems below their noteheads, and the angle and the point of attachment of stems.",10,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
There is considerable diversity in the way half notes are made in the four manuscripts.,11,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
At times they are made by a single unbroken stroke (the notehead followed by the stem) and other times the notehead is drawn first followed by the stem.,12,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"The downward stems are usually drawn from the right side of the notehead, but occasionally from the center.",13,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Their orientation can be straight, bowed or bent at an angle.",14,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"One would expect consistency in a single scribe, therefore Thompson notes that a mixture of forms indicates at least two scripts.",15,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
With plates showing the widely different scribal forms in the four manuscripts Thompson notes that they each have different scribal structures.,16,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
Mus.,17,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
510–514 has a uniform script; the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book has mostly a uniform script that gradually switches to a smaller contrasting script several times.,18,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302 on the other hand show great scribal diversity.,19,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Counting sixty changes of scribal hand for Egerton 3665 and thirty for Drexel 4302, she identifies seventeen specific hands, of which nine are shared by both manuscripts.",20,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"In summarising her discussion of scribal issues, Thompson acknowledges the difficulties of making determinations of a variety of music scripts, but concludes that there is no question of reducing the multiple hands to a single person.",21,23,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
Conclusion.,0,24,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
Thompson's conclusion is direct: The attribution of these manuscripts to Francis Tregian's hand is thus little more than an attractive legend.,1,24,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Never based on very solid biographical evidence, it is contradicted by the physical characteristics of the manuscripts themselves.",2,24,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
Their paper strongly suggests that the manuscripts were prepared by a group of professional scribes working for patrons at court or connected to court circles.,3,24,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
But a scriptorium capable of executing these commissions could scarcely have been brought into being expressly for that purpose.,4,24,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"It is likely to have dealt with other, not necessarily musical, tasks, although no further manuscripts prepared by the same group have yet been identified.",5,24,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"David J. Smith's response to Thompson's 2001 article clearly takes the traditional view of Tregian's role by repeatedly referring to the group of four manuscripts as ""The Tregian manuscripts.""",0,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"He reproduces two documents with Francis Tregian's name (one of them being HC 2/27, the same one that Thompson and Cole had reproduced) from the Royal Cornwall Museum.",1,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
Smith states that cultivated gentlemen developed more than one script.,2,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Recognizing the differences between signature and the body of the document as well as scribal inconsistencies within the same document, he states ""...there is no reason to discard the hypothesis on ground of handwriting alone"" and several lines later: ""These differences, found within a document written by the same scribe at the same time, point to the pitfalls lying in the way of those who try to prove (or disprove) hypotheses by means of handwriting alone.""",3,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
(This is a false premise since Thompson used handwriting as only one of many elements to her analysis.),4,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Where Thompson argued that the change in music script suggests more than one scribe, Smith uses exactly the same argument to argue in favour of a single scribe, since an individual's handwriting changes over time.",5,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"He states ""The Tregian manuscripts were probably compiled over many years, so inconsistencies in their notation are only to be expected"", deliberately ignoring Thompson's findings concerning the paper particularly of the uniformity of the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Mus.",6,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"510-514A. Smith notes that both the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Drexel 4302 have empty ruled staves at their ends which he sees as evidence of a ""work in progress.""",7,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Referring to Thompson's conclusion, Smith states ""It seems hardly credible that a scriptorium of professional scribes would have presented incomplete manuscripts to whomever commissioned them"", ignoring Thompson's later comment ""...the chequered history of [these manuscripts'] compilation may result from changes in the patron's requirements or even a change of patron.",8,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"""Regarding the paper gatherings from which Thompson was able to determine different origins for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book and Mus.",9,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"510-514A as compared to Egerton 3665 and Drexel 4302, Smith states ""The way in which individual gatherings have been combined to form a larger work suggests that, initially, the genesis of these sources was a far more haphazard affair: they seem more the work of a committed individual pursuing a passion, collecting together materials from sources which came his way, than the product of a grand design.""",10,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
When later he does mention the paper types revealed by Thompson he again resorts to scribal issues.,11,25,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"Smith goes on at length to discuss particular points of the music content, an aspect that Thompson deliberately did not discuss, since she recognised that physical analysis must precede content analysis Without supplying corroborative physical evidence aside from scribal issues that do not directly address or refute Thompson's discoveries, Smith feels that ""there is no reason to discard the hypothesis that Tregian was the scribe.",0,26,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
"""Whether there is still a controversy concerning Tregian, in his European Music: 1520—1640 (first published in 2006), James Haar considers the hypothesis to be ""demolished"" by Thompson's findings.",1,26,== How Tregian's name became associated with music == | === Physical evidence ===,8893457
