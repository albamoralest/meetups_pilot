"The sextet recordings of 1949 are notable for coherent ensemble playing and soloing, and the free group improvisations based on spontaneous group interactions and the contrapuntal principle.",1,18,== Influences and playing style ==,756772
"In the 1950s Tristano employed an advanced concept in jazz improvisation called side-slipping, or outside playing, which creates a form of temporary bitonality when chromatic harmony is superimposed over the standard harmonic progressions.",2,18,== Influences and playing style ==,756772
"Tristano intensified his use of counterpoint, polyrhythm, and chromaticism in the 1960s[.]",3,18,== Influences and playing style ==,756772

Lessons were typically 15–20 minutes in length.,2,21,== Teaching ==,756772
"He did not teach the reading of music or the characteristics of different styles of jazz, instead challenging students in ways that would allow them to find and express their own musical feelings, or style.",3,21,== Teaching ==,756772
Foundational elements for a student's learning were having a concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony.,4,21,== Teaching ==,756772
"One of the teaching tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome.",5,21,== Teaching ==,756772

"Max Harrison indicated that the pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print at the time of his death, suggested that he was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new ground in the history of the music.",1,23,== Legacy ==,756772
"Elements of Tristano's early playing – counterpoint, reharmonizing, and strict time – influenced Miles Davis' Birth of the Cool, and the playing of saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and pianist Dave Brubeck.",2,23,== Legacy ==,756772
"Tristano's early, more feelings-based performances also influenced the style of pianist Bill Evans, who also used overdubbing and multitracking in his own recordings after Tristano had experimented with the techniques.",3,23,== Legacy ==,756772
