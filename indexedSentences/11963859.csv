"Although De Lucia's stage career was closely tied to works by his contemporaries Mascagni and Leoncavallo, the vocal method that he exhibited in their operas was not the strenuous, declamatory mode of singing normally associated by modern listeners with the verismo movement.",0,11,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"Because his voice was not overly powerful or extensive in range, he needed to rely on his histrionic skills to project the drama fully.",1,11,== His vocal technique ==,11963859

"De Lucia's recordings of arias and duets from Rossini's Barber of Seville ('Ecco ridente', 'Se il mio nome' and 'Numero quindici', for example) show off his vocal characteristics to an even greater extent than do his records of verismo pieces (or even lyrical Verdian parts, such as Alfredo in La traviata).",0,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"They contain a studied display of fioritura, rubato, limpid phrasing and portamento which appears to be a deliberate re-statement of the so-called bel canto style practised by previous generations of Italian tenors; or perhaps more accurately, a re-statement of that style's surviving mannerisms.",1,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859

George Bernard Shaw wrote tellingly of De Lucia in June 1892.,3,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"Having seen his L'amico Fritz, he stated that: ""Signor De Lucia succeeds [Fernando] Valero ... as artificial tenor in ordinary to the establishment.",4,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"His thin strident forte is in tune and does not tremble beyond endurance; and his mezza voce, though monotonous and inexpressive, is pretty as prettiness goes in the artificial school.""",5,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"In 1894 Shaw speaks of De Lucia as a tenor of the Julián Gayarre school, without the ""goat-bleat"" of its extreme disciples.",6,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
This comment of Shaw's provides a clue.,7,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"Like Valero, Gayarre was taught by Melchiorre Vidal in Madrid.",8,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"Another of Vidal's pupils, soprano Rosina Storchio, was closely associated with verismo premieres.",9,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"De Lucia, who sang in Spain in the 1880s, may have imbibed the example set by those who studied with Vidal.",10,12,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"By referring to De Lucia as an artificial tenor, Shaw is associating him with other tenors who employed a similar vocal technique, and were inclined to color and phrase in the same sort of way as De Lucia.",0,13,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"They include Alessandro Bonci, Giuseppe Anselmi, Fiorello Giraud, Charles Friant, Edmond Clement, and David Devries.",1,13,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
The voices of several of these tenors had a fast vibrato which is apparent on their gramophone records.,2,13,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"Musicologists debate whether this is a genuine stylistic hand-me-down from the ""bel canto"" singing tradition founded by the virtuoso tenor Giovanni Rubini (1794–1854) or merely a flaw, attributable to inadequate breath support, in the vocal method adopted subsequent to Rubini by some Mediterranean tenors.",3,13,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
"Many other famous Mediterranean tenors active in De Lucia's day, such as Francesco Tamagno, Francesco Marconi, Emilio De Marchi, Francesco Vignas (a Vidal pupil, paradoxically), Giuseppe Borgatti, Giovanni Zenatello and, of course, Enrico Caruso, did not 'tremble' like De Lucia and his ilk when they sang, but their repertoire was often in heavier roles.",0,14,== His vocal technique ==,11963859
