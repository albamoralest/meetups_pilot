She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson – no mean feat for a woman writer in the 18th century.,1,21,== Legacy ==,173848

It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism in the academic world of the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.,3,21,== Legacy ==,173848
Barbauld's remarkable disappearance from the literary landscape took place for a number of reasons.,4,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"One of the most important was the disdain heaped upon her by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, poets who in their youthful, radical days had looked to her poetry for inspiration, but in their later, conservative years dismissed her work.",5,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"Once these poets had become canonised, their opinions held sway.",6,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"Moreover, the intellectual ferment of which Barbauld was an important part of – particularly at the Dissenting academies – had by the end of the 19th century come to be associated with the ""philistine"" middle class, as Matthew Arnold put it.",7,21,== Legacy ==,173848
The reformist 18th-century middle class was later held responsible for the excesses and abuses of the industrial age.,8,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"Finally, the Victorians viewed Barbauld as ""an icon of sentimental saintliness"" and ""erased her political courage, her tough mindedness,",9,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"[and] her talent for humor and irony"", to arrive at a literary figure that modernists despised.",10,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"As literary studies developed into a discipline at the end of the 19th century, the story of the origins of Romanticism in England emerged along with it.",11,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"According to this version of literary history, Coleridge and Wordsworth were the dominant poets of the age.",12,21,== Legacy ==,173848

"Even with the advent of feminist criticism in the 1970s, Barbauld did not receive her due.",14,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"As Margaret Ezell explains, feminist critics wanted to resurrect a particular kind of woman – one who was angry, who resisted the gender roles of her time, and who attempted to create a sisterhood with other women.",15,21,== Legacy ==,173848
Barbauld did not easily fit into these categories.,16,21,== Legacy ==,173848
"Indeed, it was not until Romanticism and its canon began to be re-examined through a deep reassessment of feminism itself that a picture emerged of the vibrant voice that Barbauld had contributed.",17,21,== Legacy ==,173848

The work of Marlon Ross and Anne K. Mellor represents a second way to apply the insights of feminist theory to the recovery of women writers.,0,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848
They argue that Barbauld and other Romantic women poets carved out a distinctive feminine voice in the literary sphere.,1,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848
"As a woman and a dissenter, Barbauld had a unique perspective on society, according to Ross, and it was this specific position that obliged her to publish social commentary.",2,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848
"Ross points out, however, that women were in a double bind: ""They could choose to speak politics in nonpolitical modes, and thus risk greatly diminishing the clarity and pointedness of their political passion, or they could choose literary modes that were overtly political while trying to infuse them with a recognizable 'feminine' decorum, again risking a softening of their political agenda.""",3,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848
So Barbauld and other Romantic women poets often wrote occasional poems.,4,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848
"These had traditionally commented, often satirically, on national events, but by the end of the 18th century were increasingly serious and personal.",5,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848

Scholars such as Ross and Mellor maintain that this adaptation of existing styles and genres is one way in which women poets created a feminine Romanticism.,7,27,== Literary analysis == | === Poetry ===,173848

"In the following year, after one of William Wilberforce's many abolitionist legislation failed to pass in the British Parliament, Barbauld wrote the Epistle to William Wilberforce on the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade (1791).",0,30,== Literary analysis == | === Political essays and poems ===,173848
"In the work, Barbauld lambasted Parliament for their rejection of abolitionist legislation, along with castigating the slave trade; the work focused on the supposed degeneracy of a West Indian planter and his wife which revealed the failings of the ""colonial enterprise: [an] indolent, voluptuous, monstrous woman"" and a ""degenerate, enfeebled man"".",1,30,== Literary analysis == | === Political essays and poems ===,173848
"In 1793, when the British government called on the nation to fast in honour of the war, anti-war Dissenters such as Barbauld were left with a moral quandary: ""Obey the order and violate their consciences by praying for success in a war they disapproved?",2,30,== Literary analysis == | === Political essays and poems ===,173848

"In Eighteen Hundred and Eleven (1812), written after Britain had been at war with France for a decade and was on the brink of losing the Napoleonic Wars, Barbauld presented a shocking JuvenalIan satire; she argued that the British Empire was waning and the American Empire waxing.",8,30,== Literary analysis == | === Political essays and poems ===,173848
"It is to America that Britain's wealth and fame will now go, she contended, and Britain will become a mere empty ruin.",9,30,== Literary analysis == | === Political essays and poems ===,173848

"A more strident criticism was made by the Lambs, telling of Mary's abortive search for a copy of Goody Two Shoes, which her brother claimed was because ""Mrs. Barbauld's stuff has banished all the old classics of the nursery.",13,33,== Literary analysis == | === Children's literature ===,173848
