"Although the album produced another well-received single (""Beautiful Love"") the political content of Peggy Suicide caused more friction with Island, who had signed Cope as a marketable hit-making alternative rocker but increasingly found themselves dealing with a latter-day counter-culturalist and revolutionary.",6,17,== Music == | ==== 1991–92: Peggy Suicide and Jehovahkill ====,617749
