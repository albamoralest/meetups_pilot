"Even in a conventional Western piece of instrumental music, in which all of the melodies, chords, and basslines are written out in musical notation, the performer has a degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work, by such means as by varying his or her articulation and phrasing, choosing how long to make fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and — in the case of bowed string instruments, woodwinds or brass instruments — deciding whether to use expressive effects such as vibrato or portamento.",0,4,== Composers and performers ==,198778

"A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, where the songs may be written by one person, the orchestration of the accompaniment parts and writing of the overture is done by an orchestrator, and the words may be written by a third person.",6,4,== Composers and performers ==,198778

"The nature and means of individual variation of the music are varied, depending on the musical culture in the country and time period it was written.",0,6,== Composers and performers ==,198778
"For instance, music composed in the Baroque era, particularly in slow tempos, often was written in bare outline, with the expectation that the performer would add improvised ornaments to the melody line during a performance.",1,6,== Composers and performers ==,198778
"Such freedom generally diminished in later eras, correlating with the increased use by composers of more detailed scoring in the form of dynamics, articulation et cetera; composers becoming uniformly more explicit in how they wished their music to be interpreted, although how strictly and minutely these are dictated varies from one composer to another.",2,6,== Composers and performers ==,198778

The movement might be considered a way of creating greater faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise.,1,7,== Composers and performers ==,198778
"In genres other than classical music, the performer generally has more freedom; thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a ""cover"" of an earlier song, there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original; nor is exact faithfulness necessarily highly valued (with the possible exception of ""note-for-note"" transcriptions of famous guitar solos).",2,7,== Composers and performers ==,198778

"In the development of European classical music, the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it.",1,10,== History ==,198778
The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance.,2,10,== History ==,198778
