"One outstanding client was Monument Records under producer Fred Foster, bringing his client Roy Orbison.",1,7,"== Recording career == | === RCA Records, Nashville ===",5461915
"Porter was able to create for Orbison his trademark sound, with background vocals brought nearer the foreground, beginning with ""Only the Lonely"".",2,7,"== Recording career == | === RCA Records, Nashville ===",5461915
"For that session, Porter discarded his standard mix style of building up from a foundation of percussion, and instead used the vocal countermelody as the foreground sound, and built the other sounds below and around it, leaving the percussion almost inaudible.",3,7,"== Recording career == | === RCA Records, Nashville ===",5461915

He left Columbia for Monument to manage a new studio set up by Foster at 315 Seventh Street North in Nashville.,1,9,== Recording career == | === Columbia and Monument ===,5461915
Porter found the studio's acoustic space to be superior to RCA's Studio B—it was a high-ceilinged room built to house a Masonic Lodge—but the audio equipment owned by Foster was inferior.,2,9,== Recording career == | === Columbia and Monument ===,5461915

Putnam was slimming down his business and wished to sell the studio now that Wally Heider had left it.,1,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
Porter's first day at the studio was September 1.,2,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915

"In August, Presley's producer Felton Jarvis brought the master tape for ""Suspicious Minds"" into United Recording so that Porter could help him with the song's unusual fade out and back in three-quarters of the way through.",9,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
A bigger concern was that Jarvis wanted a horn section but there were no empty tracks left on the tape.,10,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
"Porter solved the dilemma by mixing the horns live in the studio as the original session tape played back, the total blend being recorded onto a stereo master.",11,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
The song became a number one hit; the final one both for Porter and for Presley.,12,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915

"Porter went to see Presley's first rehearsal there, and found three stage monitors hanging 18 feet (5.5 m) high above the stage, with only one working.",15,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
"The hotel's engineers did not get the other two to work, so Porter had some of his own Shure Vocal Master loudspeakers brought over from the recording studio.",16,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
"He laid the column loudspeakers on their sides at the front lip of the stage and propped them up to aim at Presley, who was very happy with the result.",17,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
Presley insisted upon having Porter mix his live show in January even though he was a recording engineer with no previous experience in live sound.,18,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
"Porter quickly learned about acoustic feedback during the first song, but backstage after the show, film stars and musical artists kept complimenting Presley, telling him that Porter’s concert sound was ""just like the album"".",19,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915

"The tour was supported by Clair Brothers, who supplied all the audio gear and a monitor engineer, Bruce Jackson, who designed a powerful stage monitor system for Presley's show.",26,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
"In August 1977, Porter was changing planes in Boston to fly to Portland, Maine, to mix a Presley concert when he received a phone call informing him that the singer had died.",27,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915

"In January 1973, he resigned.",39,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
"On October 14, a ""mysterious fire"" burned out United Recording of Nevada, including all VMI's papers, stored master tapes and cases of pressed records, and Porter lost all of the recording equipment stored inside, a total he estimated at $250,000—about $1.46 million in today's dollars.",40,11,== Recording career == | === Las Vegas ===,5461915
