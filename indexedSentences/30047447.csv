Engel was one of the first—perhaps the first—musician to recognize that traditional Jewish music was not based on the major-minor tonal system that dominated classical and popular music of the period.,0,22,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"""Most Jewish songs are built on the ancient modes (Aeolian, Dorian, Mixolydian, and so on),"" he wrote in 1900.",1,22,== Engel's music ==,30047447

"His entire oevre is either piano solo, chamber works, or songs.",6,22,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"He frequently used innovative combinations for his chamber music; for example, ""Adagio Mysterioso"", opus 22, is scored for violin, cello, harp and organ.",7,22,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"He, like others of the Jewish art music movement, favored songs with obbligato string parts.",8,22,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"The song ""Ahava Rahya"", for example, is scored for singer and violin, flute, viola and organ.",9,22,== Engel's music ==,30047447
Many of Engel's songs are based on traditional Jewish folksongs.,0,23,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"For example, his cradle song ""Numi Numi Yaldaty"" (""sleep, sleep my child""), is a variant of a traditional Yiddish lullaby.",1,23,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"However, Engel often draws on sources other than Jewish traditional music, as well.",2,23,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"Ahava Rahya, cited above, is based on an Arabic melody, and many of the tunes he composed in Palestine are based on Yemenite songs.",3,23,== Engel's music ==,30047447
"Engel's popular music, which during his lifetime dominated the popular music scene in Palestine, has been largely forgotten.",0,24,== Engel's music ==,30047447
