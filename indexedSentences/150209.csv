"By the time the NME interviewed the band in October 1979 during their tour with Siouxsie and the Banshees, Smith was acknowledged as the principal writer of ""almost all of The Cure's songs and lyrics"", and stated that he was uncomfortable playing and singing songs that weren't his own.",0,15,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"Following his return from the Banshees' tour, Smith also composed most of the music for the album Seventeen Seconds using the Hammond, a drum machine and his trademark Top 20 Woolworth's guitar, during a home demo session in his parents' basement.",1,15,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
Most of the lyrics had been written in one night in Newcastle.,2,15,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209

"Although Smith wrote most of the lyrics for Seventeen Seconds, many were also rewritten by the group during the recording of the album itself.",0,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209

"Then when we record it if it's still not right it means everyone sitting around Chris Parry's (their manager's) kitchen all night scrawling sheets and sheets of paper – for ""At Night"" we got really desperate and finished up at six in the morning with Lol standing on the table pressing his head against the ceiling because he thought that might help.",3,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"Lol Tolhurst later stated that he, Gallup and Smith all wrote lyrics for The Cure's early albums, and that the group dynamic only changed after their 1982 album Pornography: Generally as Robert had to sing the words he chose which ones he sang but they were from all of us.",4,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209

"Tolhurst claimed to have written the lyrics for ""All Cats Are Grey"" from the 1981 album Faith, which he later re-recorded with his own project, Levinhurst.",6,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"In contrast to Tolhurst's recollection of their songwriting as a group effort until after 'Pornography', in 1982 Smith claimed to have written ""90 per cent of the 'Pornography' album"", and that he therefore couldn't leave The Cure, because it wouldn't be The Cure without him.",7,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"For their first four albums (Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography), all members of the group had received equal songwriting credits.",8,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"With Simon Gallup's departure reducing the group to a duo, and Tolhurst quitting drums to start taking keyboard lessons, from July 1982 until Gallup's return in February 1985, according to Smith, much of the writing and recording process within The Cure effectively became a solo effort.",9,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"Nonetheless, Tolhurst was credited as co-writer of five of the eight songs featured on 1983's singles and b-sides collection Japanese Whispers (including ""Let's Go to Bed"" and ""The Walk""), while ""The Love Cats"", ""Lament"" and ""The Dream"" were credited to Smith only.",10,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
"Of 1984's The Top, Smith would say it was ""the solo album I never made"", having played nearly all instruments himself except for drums (by Andy Anderson), with Porl Thompson contributing saxophone to one song (""Give Me It"")., and Tolhurst contributing keyboards to 3 of the album's 10 songs.",11,16,== Music career == | ==== As principal songwriter ====,150209
