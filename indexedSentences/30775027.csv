"They show up well after the artists or session musicians are done recording, and just have this audio to work with.",1,12,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"Their job consists of balancing the relative impact of each audio stream, by putting them through effects processors, and having the right amount (dry/wet ratio) of each.",2,12,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"Equalization - The main tool of a mixing engineer is the mixing console, which changes the relationship of each audio frequency, to another, to boost or cut specific frequency ranges within the track, giving each space in the limited frequency range available from 20-20,000 Hz, specifically, between ~400–8000 Hz, the most sensitive range of human hearing.",0,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"Removing conflicting frequencies from 250–800 Hz is crucial, where interference and construction between voices can create annoying, displeasing effects, called ""mud"".",1,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
Cuts in this area can help with artificial sounding brightness.,2,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"By boosting frequencies below this range, one can give voices more fullness, or depth to them.",3,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"Above this, boost can give voices presence, but only if they do not overlap with another voice's more prominent higher harmonics.",4,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"Correctly placed high Q value filters will allow surgical alteration, which is necessary in the human vocal range (~300–3000 Hz), a 1 dB boost here is equivalent in loudness to a 5-6 dB boost at the relative extremes.",5,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
"Key in removing mud is making the proper boosts higher up, to replace brightness lost when cutting shared frequencies.",6,13,== Techniques == | === Balancing a mix ===,30775027
