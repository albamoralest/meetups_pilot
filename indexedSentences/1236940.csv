Chris Cutler never studied music and taught himself drumming on makeshift drum kits assembled with whatever was on hand.,0,24,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"He slowly developed a technique using a ""top-down"" approach as opposed to the traditional ""bottom-up"" approach used by schooled drummers.",1,24,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
Drummers are first taught basic patterns which are later combined into more complex patterns.,2,24,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"Cutler learned the opposite way, hearing or imagining a sound and then disciplining his hands and feet to reproduce it.",3,24,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"This ""top-down"" approach resulted in a unique style of drumming that pervades all of Cutler's performances and recordings.",4,24,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"By the time Cutler was drumming for Henry Cow in 1971, he had become a perfectly competent, albeit unconventional, drummer.",0,25,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
The nature of Henry Cow was to experiment and explore and it was here that Cutler developed and refined his drumming techniques.,1,25,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
It was also here that he started to electrify his drum kit.,2,25,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"He began by attaching old telephone mouthpieces to drums and cymbals, and connecting them to an amplifier and a reverb unit.",3,25,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
He later added a small mixer for four independent inputs.,4,25,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
The effect was very basic: a few low-grade inputs with only equalisation and reverberation to manipulate.,5,25,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"By 1982, Cutler had added another small mixer, a pitch shifter and a delay unit.",0,26,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"He had also begun using cheap guitar transducers and a table full of additional wired objects (pans, metal trays, small tambours and egg-slicers).",1,26,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"Cutler experimented briefly with drum pads triggered to play sampled or synthesized sounds, but quickly dismissed this option because he found them unresponsive and inflexible.",0,27,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"They reduced a drum to nothing more than a switch: hit it and a pre-programmed sound is emitted, irrespective of how hard or in what manner the drum is struck.",1,27,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"Cutler preferred real-time processing: amplifying and modifying actual sounds produced by the drum, making it a kind of an electroacoustic instrument, immediate and responsive, and retaining all the qualities of an acoustic drum kit.",2,27,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"Cutler went on to wire his entire drum kit, using a 16 channel mixer with multi-effect processors, a ""Space pedal"", a ""Whammy pedal"", a PDS 8000 and an old Boss pitch shifter/delay unit.",0,28,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"In addition to transducers, he also attached miniature microphones to some of the drums and sticks.",1,28,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
Cutler introduced feedback into the mix by placing a monitor speaker near the kit.,2,28,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"The electrified drum kit continues to evolve and to Cutler it is ""satisfyingly unpredictable"", responsive to all his old techniques while continuing to generate new ones.",0,29,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
"It has a unique ""voice"" that Cutler still has not plumbed the depths of.",1,29,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
This is what prompted him to start giving solo performances because it tested his skill at playing an instrument he had to treat as an equal and evolve with.,2,29,== Electrified drum kit ==,1236940
