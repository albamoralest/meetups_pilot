"He applied to the tapes the same ""de-mastering"" process as on the 2005–2006 collections and mixed them anew, to bring out previously obscured details and to straighten out a few recurring production issues on the original recordings, such as the unintentional variations of tape speed on some songs.",1,49,== Posthumous releases and tributes ==,1099092

Live performance peculiarities ==,1,57,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"As evidenced by the various live performance clips featured within the Dentro Faber documentary series (as noted above), De André was very shy and reserved throughout his career, even as a live performer – indeed, he started performing live only in 1975, with a concert residency at the famous ""Bussola"" nightclub in Viareggio, after having reached several high points in his career, because he did not feel confident enough to perform before a live audience.",0,58,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"Furthermore, he always viewed his live shows as either a ""necessary evil"" or as a job.",1,58,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"Because of this, his live performances feature a number of idiosyncratic, eccentric behaviours and attitudes.",2,58,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"He hardly ever stood up while singing anything (the song ""Ottocento"", from Le nuvole, which he performed during his 1991 tour in support of the album, being a notable exception), preferring instead to sit on a simple wooden chair; he seldom thanked his audience vocally, expressing instead his thanks as small bows from his chair, and he very rarely delivered standard spoken introductions to single songs (such as ""The next song is...""), although, when performing a series of songs from the same album or an album in its entirety, he spoke at length about the significance and the (lyrical) contents of the album; occasionally, he used a spoken introduction to a song (such as his 1998 concert intro to ""Via del Campo"") as a pretext for exposing his ideas and beliefs.",0,59,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"While speaking, he would occasionally look down to his prompt book (see below), although his spoken parts were never written beforehand.",1,59,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"In the early years of his career, he only played his own classical nylon-string guitar, systematically refusing to play any other or newer instruments, as he believed his own playing to be worthless in comparison to his band members.",0,60,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"(In a 1975 performance with New Trolls as his backing band, he introduced guitarist Ricky Belloni as ""Ricky Belloni on guitar – the real one!"")",1,60,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"Starting from 1979, Franco Mussida, who owned a large collection of guitars, convinced him to switch to a better-sounding pre-amplified Ovation classical guitar, quoting as the primary reason for such a choice the fact that De André was in need of a pre-amplified instrument in order to be heard on a stage where everything else would be loud.",2,60,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
De André subsequently used various other brands of acoustic and classical guitars.,3,60,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"It took him ten more years, and Mauro Pagani's influence, to embrace ethnic instruments, such as the bouzouki and the Middle Eastern oud.",4,60,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"In a 1989 interview with Vincenzo Mollica for a special TG1 issue, De André admitted that he used to drink at least one liter of straight whisky before his shows, to win his severe stage fright, and that his intoxicated state often led him to unintentionally amusing mistakes on stage – such as a comment in a 1979 show with PFM, when, after performing the title track to his 1978 album Rimini, he stated that a similar story to the one in the song was told much better in «I Vitellini» by Felloni – a spoonerism for the 1965 film I Vitelloni by Federico Fellini.",0,61,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"In the mid-Eighties, after his doctor informed him that his drinking habit was turning into an addiction which could potentially harm his liver, De André adopted an even worse ""cure"" for his stage fright – namely, chain smoking, which would ultimately lead to his demise.",1,61,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"He always performed with a ""prompt book"", including copies of his lyrics, all in his own handwriting, laid out in front of him on a music stand with a table lamp on top.",0,62,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"However, the actual usefulness of the prompt book is doubtful:",1,62,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"De André can be seen not using it at all in several occasions (either not looking at it while singing or distancing himself from it, by sitting cross-legged on the stage floor), and he can also be heard singing wrong lyrics every now and then – such as his 14 February 1998 show in Rome (as testified on In Concerto), when he ends the third verse of his song ""Crêuza de mä"" by singing the last two lines of the fourth verse, then sings the same lines again in their correct place.",2,62,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
"(He can also be seen with a wry smile on his face, incongrously with the serious mood of the lyrics, immediately after realizing his mistake.)",3,62,== Live performance peculiarities ==,1099092
