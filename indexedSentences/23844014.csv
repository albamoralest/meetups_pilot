"Deming considered the previously unreleased songs to be ""some of the strongest material"" on the album, and he felt that ""there's a strength and maturity in her performances on tunes like 'A Woman in Love (With You)', 'Hold Your Head High', and 'Leave Him to Me' that outstrips a significant majority of her peers – all the more impressive considering she was just 18 when most of this was recorded.""",2,79,== Other releases and media == | ==== Reception ====,23844014

B. Barnum, Gene Page and Billy Strange; musicians Hal Blaine, Carol Kaye, Lyle Ritz, Ray Pohlman, Tommy Tedesco, Larry Knechtel, Don Randi, Plas Johnson, Julius Wechter, and future headliners Glen Campbell and Leon Russell.""",0,80,== Other releases and media == | ==== Reception ====,23844014
"Marchese singled out a number of tracks, including the Axelrod-produced, Barnum-arranged songs ""Just a Little Girl"", which he thought was ""one of the strongest of her tenure with the label"", and ""Leave Him to Me"", which ""shows Donna cutting loose with a convincing growl in her voice""; and the Douglas-produced, Nitzsche-arranged songs ""Call Me"", finding it ""inexplicable that she didn’t chart with it"", ""Donna’s sublime rendition"" of ""Woman in Love (With You)"", and ""Hold Your Head High"" which was considered ""another stunningly mature, previously unreleased track from the Loren/Nitzsche/Douglas/Wrecking Crew cadre.""",0,81,== Other releases and media == | ==== Reception ====,23844014
