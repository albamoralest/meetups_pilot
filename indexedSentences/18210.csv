"In Niven's novel Ringworld, he envisions a Ringworld: a band of material, roughly a million miles wide, of approximately the same diameter as Earth's orbit, rotating around a star.",0,14,== Influence ==,18210
"The idea originated in Niven's attempts to imagine a more efficient version of a Dyson sphere, which could produce the effect of surface gravity through rotation.",1,14,== Influence ==,18210
"Given that spinning a Dyson sphere would result in the atmosphere pooling around the equator, the Ringworld removes all the extraneous parts of the structure, leaving a spinning band landscaped on the sun-facing side, with the atmosphere and inhabitants kept in place through centrifugal force and 1,000 mi (1,600 km) high perimeter walls (rim walls).",2,14,== Influence ==,18210
"After publication of Ringworld two friends, Dan Alderson and Ctein, told Niven that the Ringworld was dynamically unstable: if the center of rotation drifts away from the central sun, gravitational forces will not ""re-center"" it, thus allowing the ring to eventually contact the sun and be destroyed.",3,14,== Influence ==,18210
"Niven used this as a core plot element in the sequel novel, The Ringworld Engineers.",4,14,== Influence ==,18210
"This idea proved influential, serving as an alternative to a full Dyson sphere that required fewer assumptions (such as artificial gravity) and allowed a day/night cycle to be introduced (through the use of a smaller ring of ""shadow squares"", rotating between the ring and its sun).",0,15,== Influence ==,18210
"This was further developed by Iain M. Banks in his Culture series, which features about 1⁄100th ringworld–size megastructures called Orbitals that orbit a star rather than encircling it entirely (actual ""Rings"" and Dyson ""Spheres"" are also mentioned but are much rarer).",1,15,== Influence ==,18210
