I never knew what that was supposed to mean.,2,3,== Early years ==,811388
It was so callous and dumb.,3,3,== Early years ==,811388

"Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world.",5,3,== Early years ==,811388

"Eggleston's early photographic efforts were inspired by the work of Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank, and by French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson's book, The Decisive Moment.",0,5,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Eggleston later recalled that the book was ""the first serious book I found, from many awful books...",1,5,== Artistic development ==,811388

"First photographing in black-and-white, Eggleston began experimenting with color in 1965 and 1966 after being introduced to the format by William Christenberry.",3,5,== Artistic development ==,811388
Color transparency film became his dominant medium in the later 1960s.,4,5,== Artistic development ==,811388
Eggleston's development as a photographer seems to have taken place in relative isolation from other artists.,5,5,== Artistic development ==,811388
"In an interview, John Szarkowski describes his first encounter with the young Eggleston in 1969 as being ""absolutely out of the blue"".",6,5,== Artistic development ==,811388

Szarkowski prevailed upon the Photography Committee of MoMA to buy one of Eggleston's photographs.,8,5,== Artistic development ==,811388
"In 1970, Eggleston's friend William Christenberry introduced him to Walter Hopps, director of Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery.",0,6,== Artistic development ==,811388

"Eggleston taught at Harvard in 1973 and 1974, and it was during these years that he discovered dye-transfer printing; he was examining the price list of a photographic lab in Chicago when he read about the process.",0,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
"As Eggleston later recalled: ""It advertised 'from the cheapest to the ultimate print.'",1,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
The ultimate print was a dye transfer.,2,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
I went straight up there to look and everything I saw was commercial work like pictures of cigarette packs or perfume bottles but the color saturation and the quality of the ink were overwhelming.,3,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
I couldn't wait to see what a plain Eggleston picture would look like with the same process.,4,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Every photograph I subsequently printed with the process seemed fantastic and each one seemed better than the previous one.""",5,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
"The dye-transfer process resulted in some of Eggleston's most striking and famous work, such as his 1973 photograph entitled The Red Ceiling, of which Eggleston said, ""The Red Ceiling is so powerful, that in fact, I've never seen it reproduced on the page to my satisfaction.",6,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
When you look at the dye it is like red blood that's wet on the wall...,7,7,== Artistic development ==,811388
"A little red is usually enough, but to work with an entire red surface was a challenge.""",8,7,== Artistic development ==,811388

Eggleston's work was exhibited at MoMA in 1976.,1,8,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Although this was over three decades after MoMa had mounted a solo exhibition of color photographs by Eliot Porter, and a decade after MoMA had exhibited color photographs by Ernst Haas, the tale that the Eggleston exhibition was MoMA's first exhibition of color photography is frequently repeated, and the 1976 show is regarded as a watershed moment in the history of photography, by marking ""the acceptance of colour photography by the highest validating institution"" (in the words of Mark Holborn).",2,8,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Around the time of his 1976 MoMA exhibition, Eggleston was introduced to Viva, the Andy Warhol ""superstar"", with whom he began a long relationship.",0,9,== Artistic development ==,811388
"During this period Eggleston became familiar with Andy Warhol's circle, a connection that may have helped foster Eggleston's idea of the ""democratic camera"", Mark Holborn suggests.",1,9,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Also in the 1970s, Eggleston experimented with video, producing several hours of roughly edited footage Eggleston calls Stranded in Canton.",2,9,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Writer Richard Woodward, who has viewed the footage, likens it to a ""demented home movie"", mixing tender shots of his children at home with shots of drunken parties, public urination, and a man biting off a chicken's head before a cheering crowd in New Orleans.",3,9,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Woodward suggests that the film is reflective of Eggleston's ""fearless naturalism—a belief that by looking patiently at what others ignore or look away from, interesting things can be seen.""",4,9,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Eggleston's published books and portfolios include Los Alamos (completed in 1974, but published much later), William Eggleston's Guide (the catalog of the 1976 MoMa exhibit), the massive Election Eve (1977; a portfolio of photographs taken around Plains, Georgia, the rural seat of Jimmy Carter before the 1976 presidential election), The Morals of Vision (1978), Flowers (1978), Wedgwood Blue (1979), Seven (1979), Troubled Waters (1980), The Louisiana Project (1980), William Eggleston's Graceland (1984; a series of commissioned photographs of Elvis Presley's Graceland, depicting the singer's home as an airless, windowless tomb in custom-made bad taste), The Democratic Forest (1989), Faulkner's Mississippi (1990), and Ancient and Modern (1992).",0,10,== Artistic development ==,811388

"The Nightclub Portraits (1973), a series of large black-and-white portraits in bars and clubs around Memphis was, for the most part, not shown until 2005.",1,11,== Artistic development ==,811388
"Lost and Found, part of Eggleston's Los Alamos series, is a body of photographs that have remained unseen for decades because until 2008 no one knew that they belonged to Walter Hopps; the works from this series chronicle road trips the artist took with Hopps, leaving from Memphis and traveling as far as the West Coast.",2,11,== Artistic development ==,811388
Eggleston's Election Eve photographs were not editioned until 2011.,3,11,== Artistic development ==,811388

"In 2017, an album of Eggleston's music was released, Musik.",0,12,== Artistic development ==,811388

Eggleston's mature work is characterized by its ordinary subject matter.,0,14,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"As Eudora Welty noted in her introduction to The Democratic Forest, an Eggleston photograph might include ""old tires, Dr. Pepper machines, discarded air-conditioners, vending machines, empty and dirty Coca-Cola bottles, torn posters, power poles and power wires, street barricades, one-way signs, detour signs, No Parking signs, parking meters, and palm trees crowding the same curb.""",1,14,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"Eudora Welty suggests that Eggleston sees the complexity and beauty of the mundane world: ""The extraordinary, compelling, honest, beautiful and unsparing photographs all have to do with the quality of our lives in the everyday world: they succeed in showing us the grain of the present, like the cross-section of a tree...",0,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
They focus on the mundane world.,1,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"But no subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!""",2,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"Mark Holborn, in his introduction to Ancient and Modern, writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: ""[Eggleston's] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane.",3,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images there is a sense of lurking danger.""",4,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"American artist Edward Ruscha said of Eggleston's work, ""When you see a picture he's taken, you're stepping into some kind of jagged world that seems like Eggleston World.",5,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"""According to Philip Gefter from Art & Auction, ""It is worth noting that Stephen Shore and William Eggleston, pioneers of color photography in the early 1970s, borrowed, consciously or not, from the photorealists.",6,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
"Their photographic interpretation of the American vernacular—gas stations, diners, parking lots—is foretold in photorealist paintings that preceded their pictures.""",7,15,== Eggleston's aesthetic ==,811388
