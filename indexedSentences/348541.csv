"One of the most delicate and controversial areas of Tveitt's biography is his affiliation with the so-called Neo-Heathenistic movement, which centered around the Norwegian philosopher Hans S. Jacobsen (1901–1980) in the 1930s in Oslo.",0,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
This is a topic that frequently returns in Norwegian public debate.,1,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Jacobsen's main thesis, inspired by the theories of the German theologist Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, was the total refutation of Christianity in favour of a new heathen system based upon Norse mythology and the Edda poetry.",2,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"The movement rejected Christianity and sought to re-introduce the Norse pre-Christian system of belief – the adoration of Odin, Thor and Balder.",3,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Jacobsen later became a member of Nasjonal Samling ('National Assembly'), which led the interim, pro-Hitler puppet government during the German occupation of Norway.",4,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Even though Geirr Tveitt displayed a deep interest in the theories of the movement, he never enrolled as a member of Nasjonal Samling.",5,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"His preoccupation with Jacobsen's thinking however, materialised in conspicuous ways; for example Tveitt invented his own non-Christian timeline based upon the arrival of Leif Erikson in what is now Canada.",6,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
Traces of Antisemitism are often found in his correspondence from the 1930s.,7,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
The Neo-Heathen system of thought found its way into Tveitt's music; his perhaps most intensely such composition is the ballet Baldur's Dreams.,8,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"In it, one could argue, Tveitt seeks to establish a link between this world – its creation, cycle and dwellers – and the eternal battle between the benevolent heathen Norse gods and their opponents, the evil jotuns.",9,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Tveitt began work on the ballet whilst studying in Leipzig, where it was first performed on 24 February 1938.",10,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"There Baldur's Dreams became a remarkable success, and performances were later given in Berlin, Tübingen, Bergen and Oslo.",11,11,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Another result of Tveitt's Norse purism was his development of the theory that the modal scales originally were Norwegian, renaming them in honor of Norse gods.",0,12,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"He also developed an intricate diatonic theory, which interconnected the modal scales through a system of double leading notes.",1,12,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
These ideas were published in his 1937 argument Tonalitätstheorie des parallellen Leittonsystems.,2,12,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Even though most musicologists agree that Tveitt's theories are colored by his personal convictions – his thesis is intelligent, challenging and thought-provoking.",3,12,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
The issue of Tveitt's inglorious relationship with so-called 'nazi-ideologies' is so delicate that most scholars have avoided it altogether.,0,13,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541
"Some commentators have noticed that one of the foremost Norwegian authorities on Tveitt, Hallgjerd Aksnes, Professor of Music  at the University of Oslo, did not address this question in her article on Tveitt in  Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.",1,13,== Life == | === A great controversy ===,348541

"His music draws from many styles and traditions, most notably the barbarism of Stravinsky's early ballets, the unique rhythms and textures of Bartók's music and the floating and mystic moods of Debussy and Ravel's music – always underpinned by idioms derived from Norwegian folk-music.",0,16,== Music == | === Introduction ===,348541

Tveitt's perhaps greatest musical project was the collection and adaptation of traditional folk melodies from the Hardanger district.,0,18,== Music == | === The great treasure of Hardanger ===,348541
Many composers and musicologists (including Norway's internationally recognised Edvard Grieg) had successfully researched and collected the music of Hardanger long before Tveitt.,1,18,== Music == | === The great treasure of Hardanger ===,348541

"In his adaptations, therefore, he sought to bring forth not only the melody itself, but also the atmosphere, mood and scenery in which it belonged.",10,18,== Music == | === The great treasure of Hardanger ===,348541
Tveitt utilised his profound knowledge of traditional and avant-garde use of harmony and instruments when he scored the tunes – achieving an individual and recognisable texture.,11,18,== Music == | === The great treasure of Hardanger ===,348541

"Starting in the late 1990s the Norwegian government began to provide some funding for the examination and preservation of the remains of Tveitt's scores, and several startling discoveries have been made.",1,22,== Recordings and research ==,348541
"Thought to have been lost for all time, Baldur's Dreams appeared amongst the damaged manuscripts, and its fate is illustrative.",2,22,== Recordings and research ==,348541

"However, after the singed manuscripts held at the NMIC were examined in 1999, it became apparent that Tveitt indeed had a copy of the 1938 original score – and through tedious restoration work by Norwegian composer Kaare Dyvik Husby and Russian composer Alexej Rybnikov from the singed manuscripts, recording, and a piano version, the ballet literally rose from the ashes.",0,23,== Recordings and research ==,348541
