"Halpern initiated groundbreaking research for her time, ""she began and conducted much of her fieldwork during a period when it was actually illegal for First Nations cultures to be celebrated, much less preserved.""",0,6,== Research ==,9043619

"When she began this collection process, it was widely thought that ""Indians"" had no music.",2,6,== Research ==,9043619
"""It took six years of intensive contact making before I was successful in convincing the Indians that they should sing for me their old authentic songs,"" she wrote.",3,6,== Research ==,9043619

She had to work closely with them and win their confidence over time.,5,6,== Research ==,9043619

"Some were specific words, while others were more onomatopoeic, indicating, for example, sounds of pain and animal sounds, and others still were choreographic cues.",2,7,== Research ==,9043619
"By the early 1980s, Halpern had identified 29 style characteristics of the folk songs she studied.",3,7,== Research ==,9043619

"These absences may be attributed to her research style which, ""was derived from but only partially resembles, an Austro-German school of comparative musicology which was incompatible with popular North American ethnomusicology, anthropology, and folklore,"" according to Chen, the clash of four paradigms through differing theoretical backgrounds left Halpern ""unduly ostracized.""",5,7,== Research ==,9043619
"In addition, Halpern's name is strangely missing from the biography of Chief Martin, and the writings of George Clutesi, an artist she worked with.",6,7,== Research ==,9043619
