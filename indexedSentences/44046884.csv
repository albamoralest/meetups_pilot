"After some years where she recovered and mainly worked with choirs, she went on a number of collection trips to the Faroes 1988-94, which resulted in a publication about spiritual singing and one about Danish language ballads, Hundredesyv-visebogen The latter in particular gained positive attention among the Faroese, partly because it was the first publication for many years to deal with Faroese dance, the folk singing genre that had best withstood the modernization of the Faroese community in the decades after World War II, and was still thriving, as it is today, in various dance associations across the islands, as well as in the Faroese communities in Denmark.",0,6,== Early works ==,44046884

"At the middle of the 20th century, the isolated and still rather traditional way of life on the Faroe Islands caused traditional folk singing to flourish here for several decades longer than was the case in, say, Europe and North America, where a modernist outlook, combined with e.g. motion pictures and radio and later tv broadcasting, had largely replaced traditional way of life, and ousted folk singing.",0,12,== Faroese folk singing ==,44046884
"The spreading of sound recording equipment among musicologists, from the 1890s the phonograph, and in particular from the 1940s the tape recorder, easy to carry and not too pricey, opened a time window of some decades, where Scandinavian and German musicologists brought modern technology to the Faroe Islands and recorded numerous examples of the islanders’ still vigorous folk singing tradition.",0,13,== Faroese folk singing ==,44046884

In 1998 Marianne Clausen began to collect from various Scandinavian archives sound recordings of Faroese kvæði (Faroese language ballads used in Faroese dance).,0,16,== Faroese folk singing == | === Kvæði ===,44046884
"After a registration check of the recordings (of who sings and what is sung), she began to make handwritten transcription drafts of all the recordings, with melody and lyrics, for the kvæði amounting to a total of 2,050 recordings.",1,16,== Faroese folk singing == | === Kvæði ===,44046884
"Then she played all the recordings again, and compared them with the transcription drafts, checking for errors or mishearings; and when she was finished, she played all the recordings one more time, checking again.",0,17,== Faroese folk singing == | === Kvæði ===,44046884
"During this repeated process, which she also used in her next books, she began to select melodies to be included in the book manuscript.",1,17,== Faroese folk singing == | === Kvæði ===,44046884
"She based this selection on criteria, which ensured that the various kvæði texts and melodies were comprehensively represented, as regards persons, geography and time (recordings from as many islands and villages as possible, with special focus on renowned singers with large repertoires, and new recordings as well as old, sometimes rather indistinguishable phonograph recordings, in some cases dating back to 1902).",2,17,== Faroese folk singing == | === Kvæði ===,44046884
"In 2003, Marianne Clausen's work with the kvæði recordings resulted in the eighth and conclusive volume, Føroya kvæði VIII, Løgini / Melodies of the magnum opus Føroya kvæði, the first seven volumes of which were published 1941-54, 1963–72 and 1996, containing the lyrics of 236 Faroese kvæði, with indexes.",0,18,== Faroese folk singing == | === Kvæði ===,44046884

"Whereas the Faroese dance with its Faroese kvæði and Danish ballad singing was used in a secular context in the traditional Faroese community, the religious side of people's lives was largely reflected in the widespread spiritual singing and Kingo-singing, called so after Danish bishop and hymn-writer Thomas Kingo (1634-1703), whose hymnal from 1699 was still widely used among the Faroese until the middle of the 20th century, as were the religious songs of Norwegian Petter Dass (1647-1707) and several other Baroque hymn-poets.",0,20,== Faroese folk singing == | === Spiritual singing ===,44046884
"The melodies used in this genre of singing may often be traced back to the ones in Kingo's melody collection, or Gradual, from 1699, but after having lived for two-and-a-half centuries among generations of Faroese folk singers, the melodies had often evolved into something very melismatic, and rhythmically and harmonically quite complicated, sometimes almost meditative.",1,20,== Faroese folk singing == | === Spiritual singing ===,44046884

"Concerning dance melodies, she noted some significant differences between melodies for Danish ballads and kvæði melodies: the melodies for Danish ballads are often more melodic than those for kvæði, they use three four time more frequently, and are often sung at ‘half speed’, as regards the number of text syllables compared to the number of steps in the dance, when compared to kvæði melodies.",3,31,== Faroese folk singing == | === Tonality ===,44046884
