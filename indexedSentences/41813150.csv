"Louis' cousin, who was an executive at the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), gave the newlyweds their first tape recorder as a wedding gift.[1] It was early tape recorder technology that used magnetized plastic tape.",1,6,== Early works ==,41813150
"Using their newly acquired equipment, the couple delved into the study of musique concrète.",2,6,== Early works ==,41813150
The first electronic music for magnetic tape composed in the United States was completed by Louis and Bebe in 1950 and was titled Heavenly Menagerie.,0,7,== Early works ==,41813150
"Electronic music composition and production were one and the same, and were slow and laborious.",1,7,== Early works ==,41813150
Tape had to be physically cut and pasted together to edit finished sounds and compositions.,2,7,== Early works ==,41813150

"The 1948 book Cybernetics: Or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, by mathematician Norbert Wiener from MIT played an important role in the development of the Barrons' composition.",0,9,== Method ==,41813150
The science of cybernetics proposes that certain natural laws of behavior apply to both animals and more complex electronic machines.,1,9,== Method ==,41813150
"By following the equations presented in the book, Louis was able to build electronic circuits that he manipulated to generate sounds.",0,10,== Method ==,41813150
Most of the tonalities were generated with a circuit called a ring modulator.,1,10,== Method ==,41813150
The sounds and patterns that came out of the circuits were unique and unpredictable because they were actually overloading the circuits until they burned out to create the sounds.,2,10,== Method ==,41813150
"The Barrons could never recreate the same sounds again, though they later tried very hard to recreate their signature sound from Forbidden Planet.",3,10,== Method ==,41813150
"Because of the unforeseen life span of the circuitry, the Barrons made a habit of recording everything.",4,10,== Method ==,41813150
Most of the production was not scripted or notated in any way.,0,11,== Method ==,41813150
The Barrons didn't even consider the process as music composition themselves.,1,11,== Method ==,41813150
"The circuit generated sound was not treated as notes, but instead as 'actors'.",2,11,== Method ==,41813150
"In future soundtrack composition, each circuit would be manipulated according to actions of the underlying character in the film.",3,11,== Method ==,41813150
"After recording the sounds, the couple manipulated the material by adding effects, such as reverb and tape delay.",0,12,== Method ==,41813150
They also reversed and changed the speed of certain sounds[2].,1,12,== Method ==,41813150
The mixing of multiple sounds was performed with at least three tape recorders.,2,12,== Method ==,41813150
"The outputs of two machines would be manually synchronized[3], and fed into an input of a third one, recording two separate sources simultaneously.",3,12,== Method ==,41813150
"The synchronization of future film work was accomplished by two 16 mm projectors that were tied into a 16 mm tape recorder, and thus ran at the same speed.",4,12,== Method ==,41813150
"While Louis spent most of his time building the circuits and was responsible for all of the recording, Bebe did the composing.",0,13,== Method ==,41813150
She had to sort through many hours of tape.,1,13,== Method ==,41813150
"As she said, ""it just sounded like dirty noise"".",2,13,== Method ==,41813150
"Over time, she developed the ability to determine which sounds could become something of interest.",3,13,== Method ==,41813150
Tape loop gave the Barrons' sounds rhythm.,4,13,== Method ==,41813150

"Soon after relocation to New York, the Barrons opened a recording studio at 9 West 8th Street in Greenwich Village that catered to the avant-garde scene.",0,15,== Recording studio ==,41813150
This may have been the first electronic music studio in the United States.,1,15,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"At the studio, the Barrons used a tape recorder to record everything and everyone.",2,15,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"They recorded Henry Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Aldous Huxley reading their work in a form of early audiobook.",3,15,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"In June 1949, Anaïs Nin recorded a full version of House of Incest and four other stories from Under a Glass Bell.",4,15,== Recording studio ==,41813150
These recordings were pressed on red vinyl and released on the Barrons' Contemporary Classics record label under the Sound Portraits series.,5,15,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"For a short time, the Barrons held a monopoly on tape recording equipment.",0,16,== Recording studio ==,41813150
The only other competition in town were the studios owned by Raymond Scott and Eric Siday.,1,16,== Recording studio ==,41813150
The connection through Louis' cousin working at 3M proved to be vital in obtaining batches of early magnetic tape.,2,16,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"Due to the lack of competition in the field, and to the surprise of the owners, the recording business was a success.",3,16,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"Aside from the tape recorders, most of the equipment in the studio was completely built by Louis.",0,17,== Recording studio ==,41813150
One of the home made pieces was a monstrous speaker that could produce very heavy bass.,1,17,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"Electronic oscillators that produced sawtooth, sine, and square waves were also home built prize possessions.",2,17,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"They had a filter, a spring reverberator, and several tape recorders.",3,17,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"A Stancil-Hoffmann reel to reel was custom built by the inventor for looping the samples, and changing their speed.",4,17,== Recording studio ==,41813150
The thriving business brought in enough income to purchase some commercial equipment.,5,17,== Recording studio ==,41813150
The Barrons' music was noticed by the avant-garde scene.,0,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150
During 1952-53 the studio was used by John Cage for his very first tape work Williams Mix.,1,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150
The Barrons were hired by Cage to be the engineers.,2,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"They recorded over 600 different sounds, and arranged them with Cage's directions in various ways by splicing the tape together.",3,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150
The four and a half minute piece took over a year to finish.,4,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"Cage also worked in the Barrons' studio on his Music for Magnetic Tape with other notable composers, including Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, and David Tudor.",5,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150
"It was Cage who first encouraged the Barrons to consider their creations ""music"".",6,18,== Recording studio ==,41813150

The Barrons quickly learned that the avant-garde scene did not reap many financial rewards.,0,20,== Film works ==,41813150
"They turned to Hollywood, which had already been using electronic instruments such as the theremin in film soundtracks for several years.",1,20,== Film works ==,41813150
"In the early 50s, the Barrons collaborated with various celebrated filmmakers to provide music and sound effects for art films and experimental cinema.",0,21,== Film works ==,41813150
The Barrons scored three of Ian Hugo's short experimental films based on the writings of his wife Anaïs Nin.,1,21,== Film works ==,41813150
The most notable of these three films were Bells of Atlantis (1952) and Jazz of Lights (1954).,2,21,== Film works ==,41813150
"The Barrons assisted Maya Deren in the audio production of the soundtrack for The Very Eye of Night (1959), which featured music by Teiji Ito.",3,21,== Film works ==,41813150
"Bridges-Go-Round (1958) by Shirley Clarke featured two alternative soundtracks, one by the Barrons and one by jazz musician",4,21,== Film works ==,41813150
Teo Macero.,5,21,== Film works ==,41813150
The film's two versions showed the same four-minute film of New York City bridges.,6,21,== Film works ==,41813150
Showing the two versions back-to-back showed how different soundtracks affected the viewer's perception of the film.,7,21,== Film works ==,41813150
"In 1956 the Barrons composed the very first electronic score for a commercial film — Forbidden Planet, released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.",0,22,== Film works ==,41813150
The Barrons approached Dore Schary (MGM's executive producer) at an exhibit of Schary's wife's paintings in 1955.,1,22,== Film works ==,41813150
"He hired them soon after, when the film was in post-production.",2,22,== Film works ==,41813150

Forbidden Planet ==,1,23,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
The soundtrack for Forbidden Planet (1956) is today recognized as the first entirely electronic score for a film.,0,24,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"Eerie and sinister, the soundtrack was unlike anything that audiences had heard before.",1,24,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
Music historians have often noted how groundbreaking the soundtrack was in the development of electronic music.,2,24,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"On the album sleeve notes of the Forbidden Planet soundtrack, Louis and Bebe explain:",0,25,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
We design and construct electronic circuits [that] function electronically in a manner remarkably similar to the way that lower life-forms function psychologically.,0,26,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
[. . .].,1,26,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"In scoring Forbidden Planet – as in all of our work – we created individual cybernetics circuits for particular themes and leit motifs, rather than using standard sound generators.",2,26,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"Actually, each circuit has a characteristic activity pattern as well as a ""voice"".",3,26,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
[. . .].,4,26,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
We were delighted to hear people tell us that the tonalities in Forbidden Planet remind them of what their dreams sound like.[4],5,26,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
The producers of the film had originally wanted to hire Harry Partch to do the music score.,0,27,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
The Barrons were brought in to do only about twenty minutes of sound effects.,1,27,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"After the producers heard the initial sample score, the Barrons were assigned an hour and ten minutes of the rest of the film.",2,27,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
The studio wanted to move the couple to Hollywood where most of the film scores were produced at the time.,3,27,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"But the couple would not budge, and took the work back to their New York studio.",4,27,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
The music and the sound effects stunned the audience.,0,28,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"During the preview of the movie when the sounds of the spaceship landing on Altair IV filled the theater, the audience broke out in spontaneous applause.",1,28,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"Later, the Barrons turned over their audio creation to GNP Crescendo records for distribution.",2,28,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
GNP had previously demonstrated its expertise in producing and marketing science fiction film soundtracks and executive album producer Neil Norman had proclaimed the film (and the soundtrack) his favorites.,3,28,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
Not everyone was happy with the score.,0,29,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
Louis and Bebe did not belong to the Musicians' Union.,1,29,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"The original screen credit for the film, which was supposed to read ""Electronic Music by Louis and Bebe Barron"", was changed at the last moment by a contract lawyer from the American Federation of Musicians.",2,29,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"In order to not upset the union, the association with the word music had to be removed.",3,29,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"The Barrons were credited with ""Electronic Tonalities"".",4,29,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150
"Because of their non-membership in the union, the film was not considered for an Oscar in the soundtrack category.",5,29,== Forbidden Planet ==,41813150

Later works ==,1,30,== Later works ==,41813150
"The Barrons did not know what to call their creations; it was John Cage, working with the Barrons in their studio for his earliest electronic work, who convinced them that it was ""music"".",0,31,== Later works ==,41813150
"The Musicians' Union forced MGM to title the Forbidden Planet score ""electronic tonalities"", not ""music"".",0,32,== Later works ==,41813150
"And seeing the handwriting on the wall, used that excuse to deny them membership in the 1950s; the union's primary concern was losing jobs for performers rather than the medium itself.",1,32,== Later works ==,41813150
"As a result, the Barrons never scored another film for Hollywood.",2,32,== Later works ==,41813150
"As the years passed, the Barrons did not continue to keep up with technology, and were perfectly content to make their music in the way they always had.",3,32,== Later works ==,41813150
"However, modern digital technology is now imitating the rich sounds of those old analog circuits.",4,32,== Later works ==,41813150
"Bebe's last work was Mixed Emotions  in 2000, from raw material collected at the University of California, Santa Barbara studio.",5,32,== Later works ==,41813150

Bebe Barron was a founding member and the first Secretary of the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States from 1985 to 1987.,2,33,== Later works ==,41813150
They awarded her with a lifetime achievement award in 1997.,3,33,== Later works ==,41813150
"In 2000, she was invited to create a new work at University of California, Santa Barbara, using the latest in sound generating technology to collect sounds there.",4,33,== Later works ==,41813150
"From October through early November 2000, she did all the actual composing in Jane Brockman's Santa Monica studio with Brockman serving as recording engineer.",5,33,== Later works ==,41813150
"The sounds collected at UCSB were imported into Digital Performer on a Macintosh computer and organized to create Bebe's final work, Mixed Emotions.",6,33,== Later works ==,41813150
