"The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges.",1,47,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Graph theory ===,17902

Euler is credited with using closed curves to illustrate syllogistic reasoning (1768).,0,60,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
These diagrams have become known as Euler diagrams.,1,60,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
An Euler diagram is a diagrammatic means of representing sets and their relationships.,0,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict sets.,1,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
"Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or ""zones"": the interior, which symbolically represents the elements of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.",2,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap.,3,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
"The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset and disjointness).",4,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets.,5,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets).,6,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902
A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a subset of it.,7,61,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Logic ===,17902

One of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music.,0,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"In 1739 he wrote the Tentamen novae theoriae musicae (Attempt at a New Theory of Music), hoping to eventually incorporate musical theory as part of mathematics.",1,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.",2,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"Even when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical, including for instance the introduction of binary logarithms as a way of describing numerically the subdivision of octaves into fractional parts.",3,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.",4,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"A first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of ""genres"", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5.",5,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2mA, where A is the ""exponent"" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2m (where ""m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible""), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned.",6,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2m.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2m.5, major third + minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2m.32, two-fourths and a tone (C–F–B♭–C); the fifth is 2m.3.5 (C–E–G–B–C); etc.",7,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"Genres 12 (2m.33.5), 13 (2m.32.52) and 14 (2m.3.53) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients.",8,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"Genre 18 (2m.33.52) is the ""diatonico-chromatic"", ""used generally in all compositions"", and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.",9,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.Euler devised a specific graph, the Speculum musicum, to illustrate the diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, recalling his interest in the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (see above).",10,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902
"The device drew renewed interest as the Tonnetz in neo-Riemannian theory (see also Lattice (music)).Euler further used the principle of the ""exponent"" to propose a derivation of the gradus suavitatis (degree of suavity, of agreeableness) of intervals and chords from their prime factors – one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation, i.e. 1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only.",11,64,== Contributions to mathematics and physics == | === Music ===,17902

Euler stayed a religious person throughout his life.,3,67,== Personal philosophy and religious beliefs ==,17902
"Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his Letters to a German Princess and an earlier work, Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister (Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers).",4,67,== Personal philosophy and religious beliefs ==,17902
These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily an argument for the divine inspiration of scripture.,5,67,== Personal philosophy and religious beliefs ==,17902

"However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for atheism were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman.",8,67,== Personal philosophy and religious beliefs ==,17902
