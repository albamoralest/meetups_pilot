"Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.Although they were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the Colonels to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the American folk music revival due to the British Invasion and homegrown folk rock acts, such as the Byrds and Bob Dylan.",11,4,== The Kentucky Colonels ==,1253793

"However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds.By the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist.",3,6,== Session work (1966–1968) ==,1253793

"When it was activated, by pulling down on the guitar neck, it pulled on the B-string and caused the guitar to simulate the ""crying"" sound of a pedal steel.",4,10,== The StringBender ==,1253793
