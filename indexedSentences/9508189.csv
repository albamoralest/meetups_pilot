Schizophonic mimesis ===,1,9,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
"Schizophonic mimesis is a term coined by Steven Feld that describes the separation of a sound from its source, and the recontextualizing of that sound into a separate sonic context.",0,10,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
"The term in and of itself describes how sound recordings, split from their source through the chain of audio production, circulation, and consumption, stimulate and license renegotiations of identity in an ethnomusicological perspective.",1,10,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
The term is composed of two parts: schizophonia and mimesis.,0,11,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
"Firstly, schizophonia, a term coined by Canadian composer R. Murray Schafer, refers to the split between an original sound and the reproduction/transmission of this sound, be it in a recording, a song, etc.",1,11,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
"For example, any sound recording, radio, and telephone is a machine of schizophonia, in that they all separate the sound from its original source; in the case of radio, the source of a New York radio show is from New York, but a listener in Los Angeles hears the noises from Los Angeles.",2,11,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
"Secondly, mimesis describes an imitation or representation of that separated sound into another context.",3,11,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189
"For example, mimesis has occurred if one places a recording of a baby's gurgle into a song.",4,11,== Academic work == | === Schizophonic mimesis ===,9508189

"Then, in 1992, on Deep Forest's album Boheme, a song called ""Sweet Lullaby"" samples Zemp's field recording of Rorogwela.",1,13,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"Furthermore, in 1996, Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek sampled the melody of ""Rorogwela"" in his song ""Pygmy Lullaby"" on his album Visual World.",2,13,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"The field recording is an example of schizophonia, and the placing of this field recording into ""Sweet Lullaby"" is an instance of schizophonic mimesis.",3,13,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"The sampling of the melody in ""Pygmy Lullaby"" demonstrates further schizophonic mimesis.",4,13,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"In 1966, ethnomusicologist Simha Arom recorded a particular style of music from the Ba-Benzélé Pygmies called Hindewhu, which consists of making music with a single-pitch flute and the human voice.",0,14,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"Soon after, Herbie Hancock adapted the Hindewhu style by using a beer bottle instead of a flute in his 1973 remake of ""Watermelon Man"".",1,14,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"Then, Madonna's song ""Sanctuary"" from the 1994 album Bedtime Stories sampled Hancock's adaptation of Hindewhu.",2,14,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
"Again, the field recording is an example of schizophonia, and the use of the Hindewhu style in Hancock's adaptation and ""Sanctuary"" are examples of schizophonic mimesis.",3,14,== Academic work == | ==== Notable examples ====,9508189
