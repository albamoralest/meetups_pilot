"He continued his constructions using experimental materials such as rubber, latex, fiberglass, neon, and lead.",1,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
His Belt Pieces were made with strips of rubber and hung on the wall using gravity as a forming device.,2,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
Serra combined neon with continuous strips of rubber in his sculpture Belts (1966–67) referencing the serial abstraction in Jackson Pollock’s Mural (1963.),3,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
"Around that time Serra wrote Verb List (1967) a list of transitive verbs (i.e. cast, roll, tear, prop, etc.) which he used as directives for his sculptures.",4,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575

"In 1968 Serra was included in the group exhibition “Nine at Castelli” at Castelli Warehouse in New York where he showed Prop (1968), Scatter Piece (1968), and made Splashing (1968) by throwing molten lead against the angle of the floor and wall.",9,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
In 1969 his piece Casting was included in the exhibition Anti-Illusion: Procedures/Materials at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.,10,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
In Casting the artist again threw molten lead against the angle of the floor and wall.,11,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
He then pulled the casting made from the hardened lead away from the wall and repeated the action of splashing and casting creating a series of free-standing forms.,12,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
“To prop” is another transitive verb from Serra’s “Verb List” utilized by the artist for a series assemblages of lead plates and poles dependent on leaning and gravity as a force to stay upright.,13,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
Serra’s early Prop Pieces such as Prop (1968) relied mainly on the wall as a support.,14,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
Serra wanted to move away from the wall to remove what he thought was a pictorial convention.,15,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
In 1969 he propped four lead plates up on the floor like a house of cards.,16,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
The sculpture One Ton Prop: House of Cards (1969) weighed 1 ton and the four plates were self-supporting.,17,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
Another pivotal moment for Serra occurred in 1969 when he was commissioned by the artist Jasper Johns to make a Splash Piece in Johns’s studio.,18,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
"While Serra heated the lead plates to splash against the wall, he took one of the larger plates and set it in the corner where it stood on its own.",19,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
Serra’s break into space followed shortly after with the sculpture Strike: To Roberta and Rudy (1969–71).,20,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
Serra wedged an 8 by 24-foot plate of steel into a corner and divided the room into two equal spaces.,21,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575

"Serra first recognized the potential of working in large scale with his Skullcracker Series made during the exhibition, “Art and Technology,” at the L.A. County Museum of Art in 1969.",23,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
He spent ten weeks building a number of ephemeral stacked steel pieces at the Kaiser Steelyard.,24,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
"Using a crane to explore the principles of counterbalance and gravity, the stacks were as tall as 30 to 40 feet high and weighed between 60 and 70 tons.",25,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
They were knocked down by the steel workers at the end of each day.,26,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575
The scale of the stacks allowed Serra to begin think of his work outside the confines of gallery and museum spaces.,27,5,== Work == | === Early Works ===,518575

In 1970 Serra received a Guggenheim Fellowship and traveled to Japan.,0,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"His first outdoor sculptures, To Encircle Base Plate (Hexagram) (1970) and Sugi Tree (1970), were both installed in Ueno Park as part of the “Tokyo Biennale.”",1,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"While in Japan, Serra spent most of his time studying the Zen gardens and temples of the Myoshin-ji in Kyoto.",2,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The layout of the gardens revealed the landscape as a total field that can only be experienced by walking.,3,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The gardens changed Serra’s way of seeing space in relation to time.,4,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Upon returning to the US he built his first site-specific outdoor work: To Encircle Base Plate Hexagram, Right Angles Inverted (1970).",5,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Here Serra embedded two semi-circular steel flanges, forming a ring 26 feet in diameter, into the surface of 183rd Street in the Bronx.",6,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"One semi-circle measured 1 inch wide and the second, 8 inches wide.",7,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The work was visible from two perspectives: either when the viewer came directly upon it or from above on a stairway overlooking the street.,8,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Throughout the 1970s Serra continued to make outdoor site-specific sculpture for urban areas and landscapes Serra’s was interested in the topology of landscape and how one relates to it through movement, space, and time.",9,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"His first landscape work was made in late 1970 when Serra was commissioned by the art patrons Joseph and Emily Rauh Pulitzer to build a sculpture on their property outside St. Louis, Missouri.",10,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Pulitzer Piece: Stepped Elevation (1970–71) was Serra’s first large-scale landscape work.,11,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Three plates measuring 5 feet high by 40 to 50 feet long were placed across approximately 3 acres.,12,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The placement of the plates was determined by the fall of the landscape.,13,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Each plate was impaled into the ground far enough until its rise was 5 feet.,14,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Serra’s intention was for the plates to act as cuts in the landscape that function as surrogate horizons as viewers walked amongst them.,15,7,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Shift (1970–72), Serra’s second endeavor in the landscape, was built in a field owned by the collector Roger Davidson in King City, Ontario.",0,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The sculpture is composed of six rectilinear concrete sections placed along the sloping landscape.,1,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
In 2013 Shift was designated a Heritage Site under the Ontario Heritage Act.,2,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Shift, like Pulitzer Piece, was based on the elevational fall of the land over a given distance.",3,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The top edges of the plates function as a horizon being placed into specific elevational intervals as you walk the entire field.,4,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Serra’s subsequent site-specific works in landscape continued to explore the topography of the land and how the sculpture relates to this topography by way of movement, meditation, and perception of the viewer.",5,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Among the most notable of the landscape works are Porten,6,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"i Slugten (1983–86) in Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Denmark; Afangar (Stations, Stops on the Road, To Stop and Look: Forward and Back, To Take It All In) (1990) in Videy Island, Iceland; Schunnemunk Fork (1991) in Storm King Art Center, New York; Snake Eyes and Box Cars (1993) in Sonoma County, California; Te Tuhirangi Contour (2000-2) in Kaipara, New Zealand; and East-West/West-East (2014) in Qatar.",7,8,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"The sculpture Porten i Slugten (1983–86) was commissioned for the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark.",0,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"After walking the museum grounds, Serra chose a ravine that runs towards the Kattegat Sea as the site for his sculpture.",1,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The ravine was the only area in the grounds that had not been landscaped.,2,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Two plates were set at an angle to each other at the end of a sloping stretch of path which fronts the ravine.,3,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The plates function in their location like a gate which opens as the viewer walks down the path towards the sea.,4,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Seen from the center of a bridge, which crosses the ravine and leads to the museum, the two plates form a single plane as if the gate had closed.",5,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"As you walk down from the museum to the ocean below, the plates appear to have a continuous swinging motion.",6,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
In 1988 Serra was invited by the National Gallery of Iceland to build a work.,7,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Serra chose Videy Island as the site for Afangar (Stations, Stops on the Road, To Stop and Look: Forward and Back, To Take It All In) (1990).",8,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"The sculpture is comprised of nine pairs of basalt columns (a material indigenous to Iceland) and placed along the periphery of Vesturey, the northwest part of the island.",9,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"All nine locations share the same elevations in that the stones of each pair are situated at an elevation of 9 and 10 meters, respectively.",10,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
Each set of stones is level at the top.,11,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
All stones at the higher elevation measure 3 meters; all stones at the lower elevation measure 4 meters.,12,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Because of the variance of topography, the stones in a set are sometimes closer together, sometimes further apart.",13,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The rise and fall of Videy Island and the surrounding landscape is seen against the fixed measure of the standing stones.,14,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The stones are visible along the horizon of the island and orient the viewer against the rise and fall of the surrounding landscape.,15,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"Te Tuhirangi Contour (2000-2) is located on vast open pasture on Gibbs Farm in Kaipara, New Zealand.",16,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"The sculpture stands 20 feet high and spans 844 feet as one continuous contour that follows the rolling hills, expansion, and contraction of the landscape.",17,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The sculpture’s elevation is perpendicular to the fall of the land.,18,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
"East-West/West-East (2014), located on an East-West axis in the Brouq Nature Reserve in Qatar, was commissioned by Sheika al-Mayassa al-Thani of Qatar.",19,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
It consists of four steel plates either 54 3/4 or 48 1/2 feet high.,20,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The plates are placed at irregular intervals in a valley that runs between two gypsum plateaus.,21,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The plates are level to each other and the elevation of the adjacent plateaus.,22,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575
The work spans less than a kilometer and all plates are visible from either end.,23,9,== Work == | === Landscape Works ===,518575

"In the landscape, the sculptural elements draw the viewer’s attention to the topology of the land as its walked.",0,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
Serra’s site-specific Urban sculptures focus the viewer’s attention on the sculpture itself.,1,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Their locations often more accessible to the public than the landscape works, invite the viewer to walk inside, pass through and move around them.",2,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Because of the confines of Urban architecture, sculptures such as Sight Point (1972–75) at the Stedelijk Museum, The Netherlands; Terminal (1977) in Bochum, Germany; T.W.U. (1980) at the Deichterhallen, Hamburg, Germany; Fulcrum (1986–87), installed in Broadgate, London; Exchange (1996) outside the City of Luxembourg; or 7 (2011) on a pier in Doha, Qatar, reflect the verticality of their surrounding architecture.",3,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Outdoor sculptures like St. John’s Rotary Arc (1980) temporarily installed outside the Holland Tunnel entrance in New York City; Tilted Arc (1981) installed and later removed from New York City’s Federal Plaza; Clara-Clara (1983), temporarily installed at Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, Paris; Berlin Junction (1987) installed outside the Berlin Philharmonic; are all curved forms or arcs that open and close depending on the direction the viewer takes walking around them.",4,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Sight Point (1972–75) was Serra’s first vertical Urban work and a continuation of the balance and counterbalance principles of his earlier Prop Sight Point stands outside the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, consisting of three vertical steel plates 10 feet wide and 40 feet high that lean in at an angle and forming a triangular space on the ground with three openings that can be walked through.",5,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
Once inside the viewer can look up and see the sky framed by the triangular shape made by the leaning plates.,6,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Another vertical sculpture, Terminal (1977), was conceived for “Documenta VI” in 1977.",7,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"It was permanently installed on a traffic island between the street car tracks in front of a train station in Bochum, Germany.",8,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
Serra chose the site because of its proximity to a high traffic area.,9,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Exchange (1996), sited in a vehicular round-about on top of a highway tunnel, made of seven trapezoidal plates.",10,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
The sculpture stands 60 feet high and can be seen by drivers as they enter and leave the City of Luxembourg.,11,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"In 1980 Serra installed two sculptures, with support of the Public Art Fund, in New York City.",12,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
T.W.U. (1980) and St. John’s Rotary Arc (1980) were each placed in areas where traffic and people converged.,13,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"T.W.U, a vertical sculpture comprised of three vertical plates, each 36 feet high, was installed at a subway entrance near West Broadway between Leonard and Franklin Streets.",14,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"The sculpture is now permanently installed outside the Deichterhallen, Hamburg, Germany.",15,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"St. John’s Rotary Arc, one of Serra’s earliest curved sculptures, was 12 feet high and spanned 180 feet.",16,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
From 1980-88 the site-specific sculpture was installed on the rotary at the entrance and exit to the Holland Tunnel.,17,11,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"The following year in 1981, a second site-specific curved sculpture Tilted Arc (1981) was installed in New York City’s Federal Plaza.",0,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"Commissioned by the U.S. General Services Administration’s Art-in-Architecture Program following a rigorous selection process, the sculpture’s arc spanned 120 feet and 12 feet high.",1,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
The sculpture was a curve that tilted and leaned away from its base.,2,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
It was anchored into the plaza at both ends so that the center of the sculpture was raised.,3,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
Serra’s intention for the sculpture was to draw pedestrians’ attention to the sculpture as they crossed the plaza.,4,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
Tilted Arc was met with resistance by a fraction of workers in the Federal building.,5,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"An eight-year campaign to remove the sculpture ensued and Tilted Arc was ultimately removed on March 15, 1989.",6,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575
"In Serra’s defense to preserve the sculpture he stated “To remove the work is to destroy the work,” advocating an art-for art’s sake mantra of site-specific artworks.",7,12,== Work == | === Urban Works ===,518575

"Following his process-based works of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Serra began to solely use rolled or forged steel in his sculpture.",0,15,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
Berlin Block (for Charlie Chaplin) (1977) was Serra’s first forged sculpture.,1,15,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575

Serra’s most known series of sculpture using rolled steel plates are the Torqued Ellipses.,0,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
In 1991 Serra visited Borromini’s Church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome and mistook the ovals of the dome and the floor to be offset from one another.,1,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
He thought to make a sculpture in this torqued form.,2,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
Serra constructed models of this perceived form in his studio by cutting two ellipse-shaped pieces of wood and nailing a dowel between them.,3,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
He then turned the ellipses so they were at a right angle to one another and wrapped a sheet of lead around the form.,4,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
After making a template from the models Serra worked with an engineer to fabricate the sculptures.,5,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
In total there are seven Torqued Ellipses and four Double Torqued Ellipses (an ellipse inside of an ellipse) dated between 1996-2004.,6,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
Each sculpture has a different degree or torque and measures up to 13 feet high.,7,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
The sculptures all have an opening so that they can be walked through and around.,8,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
"Three Torqued Ellipses are on permanent view at Dia Beacon, New York.",9,16,== Work == | === Gallery Works ===,518575
