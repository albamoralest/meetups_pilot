"This was the beginning of the artist's engagement with double standards related to gender and sexuality, which was expressed in much of her work.",4,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"She recalls her father saying ""I love you"" repeatedly to her mother, despite infidelity.",5,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"""He was the wolf, and she was the rational hare, forgiving and accepting him as he was.""",6,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"Her 1993 work Cell: You Better Grow Up, part of her Cell series, speaks directly to Louise's childhood trauma and the insecurity that surrounded her.",7,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"2002's Give or Take is defined by hidden emotion, representing the intense dilemma that people face throughout their lives as they attempt to balance the actions of giving and taking.",8,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"This dilemma is not only represented by the shape of the sculpture, but also the heaviness of the material this piece is made of.",9,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
Motherhood is another recurrent theme of Bourgeois's work.,10,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
It was her mother who encouraged Bourgeois to draw and who involved her in the tapestry business.,11,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
Bourgeois considered her mother to be intellectual and methodical; the continued motif of the spider in her work often represents her mother.,12,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"The notion of a spider that spins and weaves its web is a direct reference to her parents' tapestry business and can also be seen as a metaphor for her mother, who repairs things.",13,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
Bourgeois has explored the concept of feminity through challenging the patriarchal standards and making artwork about motherhood rather than showing women as muses or ideals.,14,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
She has been described as the 'reluctant hero of feminist art'.,15,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"Louise Bourgeois had a feminist approach to her work similar to fellow artists such as Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse, less driven by the political but rather made work that drew on their experiences of gender and sexuality, naturally engaging with women's issues.",16,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
Architecture and memory are important components of Bourgeois's work.,17,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"Bourgeois's work are very organic, biological, reproductive feel to them; they draw attention to the work itself.",18,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"Louise describes architecture as a visual expression of memory, or memory as a type of architecture.",19,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
The memory which is featured in much of her work is an invented memory - about the death or exorcism of her father.,20,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
The imagined memory is interwoven with her real memories including living across from a slaughterhouse and her father's affair.,21,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"To Louise her father represented injury and war, aggrandizement of himself and belittlement of others and most importantly a man who represented betrayal.",22,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
Her 1993 work Cell (Three White Marble Spheres) speaks to fear and captivity.,23,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
The mirrors within the present an altered and distorted reality.,24,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
Sexuality is undoubtedly one of the most important themes in the work of Louise Bourgeois.,25,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
The link between sexuality and fragility or insecurity is also powerful.,26,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
It has been argued that this stems from her childhood memories and her father's affairs.,27,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
1952's Spiral Woman combines Louise's focus on female sexuality and torture.,28,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
The flexing leg and arm muscles indicate that the Spiral Woman is still above though she is being suffocated and hung.,29,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
1995's In and Out uses cold metal materials to link sexuality with anger and perhaps even captivity.,30,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"The spiral in her work demonstrates the dangerous search for precarious equilibrium, accident-free permanent change, disarray, vertigo, whirlwind.",31,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"There lies the simultaneously positive and negative, both future and past, breakup and return, hope and vanity, plan and memory.",32,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117
"Louise Bourgeois's work is powered by confessions, self-portraits, memories, fantasies of a restless being who is seeking through her sculpture a peace and an order which were missing throughout her childhood.",33,38,== Work == | === Themes ===,604117

The work was exhibited in London months after Bourgeois's death in 2010.,1,41,== Work == | ==== Do Not Abandon Me ====,604117
The subject matter consists of male and female images.,2,41,== Work == | ==== Do Not Abandon Me ====,604117
"Although they appear sexual, it portrays a tiny female figure paying homage to a giant male figure, like a God.",3,41,== Work == | ==== Do Not Abandon Me ====,604117
Louise Bourgeois did the water colors and Tracey Emin did the drawing on top.,4,41,== Work == | ==== Do Not Abandon Me ====,604117
It took Emin two years to decide how to figure out what she would contribute in the collaboration.,5,41,== Work == | ==== Do Not Abandon Me ====,604117
