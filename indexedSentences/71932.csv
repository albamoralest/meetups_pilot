Technique ==,1,15,== Technique ==,71932
"The right hand is responsible for the guitar's musical sound, so when examining technique, the way the right hand is placed in relation to the strings is most important.",0,16,== Technique ==,71932
"For several years, it was thought among the guitar community that Segovia plucked the strings with a combination of fingertip and nail (as stated by Christopher Parkening), but Segovia plucked the strings only with the nails.",1,16,== Technique ==,71932
"When asked which technique he used, he replied: ""the only one there is: nails.",2,16,== Technique ==,71932
"Because they bring timbre differences and colour variation and give sonorous volume to the guitar.""",3,16,== Technique ==,71932
His right hand was placed so that the nails were perpendicular to the strings.,4,16,== Technique ==,71932
In this way the nail alone would press the string.,5,16,== Technique ==,71932
"At the same time, it was thought that this was the only way to avoid unpleasant noise coming from the low strings (E, A and D) of the guitar when plucked.",6,16,== Technique ==,71932
Segovia created a strong bass sound with his right thumb in spite of his technique.,7,16,== Technique ==,71932
This was largely due to the flexibility he had in his thumb which helped to create a very strong and voluminous sound in the bass notes.,8,16,== Technique ==,71932
Another innovation that separated Segovia from the Tarrega school was the search for the tension in the strings by placing his right hand further to the right side.,9,16,== Technique ==,71932
"In this way, he could not only obtain colour variation but an especially strong, round and voluminous sound, something very helpful for giving concerts in big halls (this technique was later used by Narciso Yepes).",10,16,== Technique ==,71932
"Before Segovia, guitarists from the Tarrega school played the guitar with the hand right over the soundhole, thus creating a mellow sound, but not capable of filling the whole space of a large concert hall.",11,16,== Technique ==,71932
"After World War II, Segovia became among the first to endorse nylon strings instead of catgut strings.",0,17,== Technique ==,71932

"Segovia's repertoire consisted of three principal pillars: first, contemporary works, including concertos and sonatas, usually specifically written for Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships, notably Federico Moreno Torroba, Federico Mompou, and Joaquín Rodrigo, the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and the great Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos; second, transcriptions, usually made by Segovia himself, of classical works originally written for other instruments (e.g., lute, harpsichord, piano, violin, cello) by Johann Sebastian Bach, Isaac Albéniz, Enrique Granados, and many other prominent composers; third, traditional classical guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco Tárrega.",0,19,== Repertoire ==,71932
"Segovia's influence enlarged the repertoire, mainly as a commissioner or dedicatee of new works, as a transcriber, and to a far lesser extent as a composer with such works as his Estudio sin luz.",1,19,== Repertoire ==,71932
Segovia's main musical aesthetic preferences were music of the early 20th century (and turn of the century) especially in the Spanish romantic-modern and nationalist style.,0,20,== Repertoire ==,71932
This is perhaps best typified by Segovia's own work Estudio sin,1,20,== Repertoire ==,71932
Luz.,2,20,== Repertoire ==,71932
"Many works of this and similar style were written especially for him and formed part of his core repertoire: particularly the guitar works of Federico Moreno Torroba (1891–1982), such as the Sonatina, which was first performed by Segovia in Paris in 1925.",3,20,== Repertoire ==,71932
Segovia was selective and only performed works with which he identified personally.,4,20,== Repertoire ==,71932
"He was known to reject atonal works, or works which he considered too radical, even if they were dedicated to him; e.g. he rejected Frank Martin's Quatre pièces brèves, Darius Milhaud's Segoviana, etc.",5,20,== Repertoire ==,71932

Segovia can be considered a catalytic figure in granting respectability to the guitar as a serious concert instrument capable of evocativeness and depth of interpretation.,0,24,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932
"It was Federico Moreno Torroba who said: ""The musical interpreter who fascinates me the most is Andrés Segovia"".",1,24,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932

"In Linares the Segovia Museum ""Fundación Andrés Segovia"" was established in May 1995, and Linares (Segovia's birthplace) also has a bronze statue in his honour, created by Julio López Hernández and unveiled on 25 May 1984.",0,25,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932

"Further, Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar, including several transcriptions of Bach—in particular, an extraordinarily demanding classical guitar transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004).",2,25,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932
"During his lifetime, guitarists were eager to claim association with Segovia, and Segovia himself suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as has been claimed; he once said, ""All over the world I have 'pupils' I have never met.",3,25,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932
"""His editions of works originally written for guitar include newly fingered and occasionally revised versions of works from the standard repertoire (most famously, his edition of a selection of twenty estudios by Fernando Sor, the ""cornerstone"" of every serious student's technique since its publication in 1945, although somewhat ironically Segovia in the preface to that work disparaged Sor as ""not among the vigorous talents"") as well as compositions written for him, including by Heitor Villa-Lobos, Federico Mompou, and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.",4,25,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932
"Many of the latter were edited by Segovia, working in collaboration with the composer, before they were first published.",5,25,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932
"Because of Segovia's predilection for altering the musical content of his editions to reflect his interpretive preferences, many of today's guitarists prefer to examine the original manuscripts, or newer publications based on the original manuscripts to compare them with Segovia's published versions, so as to accept or reject Segovia's editorial decisions.",6,25,== Repertoire == | === Legacy ===,71932
