"Frank Allen's debut single with the band, a strong cover of Jackie DeShannon's ""When You Walk in the Room"", shot to #3 in the UK, suggesting all was well for the revised lineup (some fans had been unhappy about Jackson's shock departure), and later UK chart hits followed with ""What Have They Done to the Rain"", ""Goodbye My Love"" (a rather experimental single for that time, with long harmonised passages, that reached number four), then the folk-flavoured ""Take Me For What I'm Worth"" (written by P.F. Sloan).",5,9,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374

"Further Pye albums It's the Searchers (1964), Sounds Like Searchers and finally Take Me for What I'm Worth (both 1965) were better spaced, but a budget ""Golden Guinea"" reissue of the second album, plus a compilation Smash Hits and Smash Hits Vol 2, on Pye's budget ""Marble Arch"" label were issued during 1966 and 1967 in place of any later ""new"" album.",2,10,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374

"In 1967, Curtis formed a new band called Roundabout with keyboard player Jon Lord and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore.",2,11,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374

"Chris Curtis's choice of Bobby Darin's ""When I Get Home"", despite a strong band performance, was a relative chart failure by their standards.",0,12,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"This to an extent undermined Curtis's position as song selector for the band, and some internal disagreements resurfaced over musical policy and direction that had been evident earlier when Tony Jackson had left, and likely played a part in Curtis leaving as well after the 1966 Australian tour.",1,12,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"This departure was a major blow, as Curtis had been chief songwriter, song selector, and key high harmony voice, as well as a figurehead member and the main PR man.",2,12,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"As musical styles evolved, The Searchers did attempt to move with the times, recording covers of songs by The Rolling Stones (""Take It Or Leave it"") and The Hollies ""Have You Ever Loved Somebody"", which was a minor UK chart hit though a rival cover by Paul & Barry Ryan probably robbed both parties of a bigger hit).",0,13,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"They began to write their singles' A-sides, first with the Curtis-Pender track ""He's Got No Love"", which had a Stones-style guitar hook, and later a Pender-Allen song, ""Secondhand Dealer"", the final Pye single, which was a Ray Davies-style ""observational"" song.",1,13,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"However, Pye records dropped the group in 1967 when their original contract expired.",2,13,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"Without any follow-up to the strong 1965 album, Take Me For What I'm Worth, and despite some strong later recordings, no further chart successes occurred, doubling the impact of Chris Curtis's departure.",3,13,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"After Curtis' departure Frank Allen handled the high harmonies, and new drummer John Blunt boosted them musically but, despite some promising latter Pye singles, including a cover of ""Western Union"", their UK chart days were over.",0,14,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"Although they continued to record for Liberty Records and RCA Records, they ended up on the British ""Chicken-in-a-Basket"" touring circuit, although they did score a minor US hit in 1971 with ""Desdemona"".",1,14,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374

"However, that was overshadowed by Pye's ""Golden Hour of..."" compilation of the original hits that came out at the same time.",3,14,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"Despite recording new material, including covers of Neil Sedaka's ""Solitaire"" and the Bee Gees' ""Spicks And Specks"", which were issued as RCA singles with scant promotion, much of their new work was not issued at the time, and RCA later dropped the group.",4,14,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"The group continued to tour through the 1970s, playing both the expected old hits as well as contemporary songs such as a powering extended live version of Neil Young's ""Southern Man"".",0,15,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
They were rewarded in 1979 when Sire Records signed them to a multi-record deal.,1,15,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
Two albums were released: The Searchers and Play for Today (retitled Love's Melodies outside the UK).,2,15,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374

"But with scant promotion and little if any radio airplay, they did not break into the charts.",4,15,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"The first album was quickly revamped following release with a few extra tracks added, one song dropped (a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Coming From The Heart""), and a new sleeve, which may have only confused the public.",5,15,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"The albums did, however, revive the group's career, because concerts from then on alternated classic hits with the newer songs that were well received.",0,16,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"A Sire single, ""Hearts in Her Eyes"", written by Will Birch and John Wicks of The Records, and successfully updating their distinctive 12-string guitars/vocal harmonies sound, picked up some radio airplay, and with more promotion might have charted.",1,16,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374
"Meanwhile, PRT Records actively promoted the group's sixties back catalogue, with compilations such as ""The Searchers File"" and ""Spotlight on the Searchers"", which were on sale at group gigs, along with the Sire albums, and helped re-establish them.",2,16,== Band history == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,1190374

"They promoted this with a UK Television appearance on ""The Leo Sayer Show"", which was rare for them by then, but the single got little if any radio airplay (like their Sire singles) and was not stocked by most record shops.",2,18,== Band history == | === 1980s – 2020s ===,1190374
"The rest of the tracks, except one, would be included as part of 1992's 30th Anniversary collection.",3,18,== Band history == | === 1980s – 2020s ===,1190374
