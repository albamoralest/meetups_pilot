In 1964 Cavin started working as chief engineer for McCune Sound in San Francisco; a regional sound company founded in 1932 by Harry McCune.,0,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Cavin supervised the design, production and testing of the company's audio products, and he designed a 16-channel stereo mixing console used at Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.",1,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"At the request of Harry McCune, Jr., audio engineer John Meyer was hired by McCune to produce the 3-way JM-3 concert loudspeaker.",2,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Cavin implemented a unity-sum crossover circuit that did not require flipping the polarity of adjacent passband drivers as was common at the time, and he modified the Crown DC-Series amplifiers to allow low-impedance loads of multiple drivers in parallel.",3,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"The powerful JM-3 system was revolutionary, proving itself on many rock and pop concerts, starting with Joan Baez and then the Four for McGovern concert with Barbra Streisand in April 1972.",4,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Sound designer Abe Jacob specified the JM-3 throughout the 1970s for his Broadway shows, especially Jesus Christ Superstar and Beatlemania.",5,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Also for Beatlemania, Cavin modified the Electro-Voice 1776 vocal microphones to have less distortion by rebiasing the internal FET and changing the output capacitor.",6,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"The JM-3 was the first full-range integrated electronically controlled loudspeaker system used for live sound, a category that expanded greatly in the next ten years.",7,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Cavin led the McCune engineering team in creating the MM-4, the first mixing console intended solely for stage monitors.",8,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Another project was the MC-8 mixer for front-of-house, with 22 inputs, 2 effects sends and returns, 8 subgroups and 4 main outputs, built by McCune engineer Istvan B. ""Steve"" Kadar.",9,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"The MC8 was unusual for having a matrix mixer section, and for its very low noise floor of −130.5 dBv, as referenced to the ideal single-resistor noise floor of −131 dBv at 0.775 volts.",10,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
Both of these mixers were used on Beatlemania in 1979.,11,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"In 1976, Cavin headed the design of the McCune SM-3 2-way loudspeaker, again using a zero-sum crossover, and incorporating a compression driver design patented by Meyer, its phenolic diaphragm modified to yield higher compliance.",12,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Meyer assisted in time-aligning the two passbands, with Cavin determining that the SM-3 sounded more pleasing when the high frequencies were slightly ahead of the lows, a conclusion reached independently by Don Pearson, sound engineer for the Grateful Dead.",13,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"In 1977, Cavin supervised the development of the McCune SM-4 2-way coaxial loudspeaker, based on the classic Altec 604E but with a low frequency driver extensively reworked by Kadar to deliver higher power, and also fitted with Meyer's more compliant high frequency compression driver.",14,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Cavin designed an active all-pass network to time-align the passbands, slightly delaying the low frequencies to match the highs.",15,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
Cavin's proprietary improvement to the Altec 604 compared favorably with the same concept implemented via passive components by Ed Long for the contemporary UREI 813 studio monitor: his trademarked Time-Align process.,16,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Meyer was contracted by McCune to design the JM-10 concert loudspeaker, a large single-point-source system intended to replace ten JM-3s.",17,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
Cavin chose a bucket-brigade delay to align the high frequency drivers about 1.5 milliseconds back from the mids and lows.,18,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"Digital delay devices were tried but they had too much distortion, while the chosen bucket-brigade solution was somewhat hissy.",19,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
Cavin designed a noise gate for the JM-10 processing to stop the high frequency hiss when no signal was present.,20,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
The JM-10 system was used on the Kool Jazz Festival touring the U.S. in mid-1977.,21,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
Cavin accompanied the tour to provide technical support.,22,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"In the late 1970s, Cavin designed a 50-pair snake splitter for large events, used to send each microphone signal to multiple mixers such as for front-of-house mix (FOH), monitor mix and a recording truck.",23,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
The splitter used Jensen transformers and two latching 27-pair snake connectors for each mixer.,24,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
"The splitter system was used on many events, for instance the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, which needed duplicate 27-pair stage boxes on both sides of a rotating stage.",25,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
It was also used on the Monterey Jazz Festival to feed FOH and two trucks.,26,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
Cavin put a one-amp fuse across the electrical ground to make certain that musicians would be protected from electrocution in case of electrical fault.,27,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228

"Cavin also flew to Bacharach shows in the Philippines in 1981, and other dates in Reno, Las Vegas, and more.",29,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228
For overseas concerts the JM-3 loudspeaker system was flown as cargo in a commercial jet.,30,4,== McCune Sound ==,61653228

"After 1979 when Meyer started his own company, Meyer Sound Laboratories, McCune bought a number of the flagship Meyer UPA 2-way loudspeakers for their rental stock, and also recommended them to clients such as the Crystal Cathedral who wanted to purchase loudspeakers rather than rent them.",0,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
McCune engineer Ken DeLoria grew frustrated working with Meyer and he decided to re-engineer the UPA to create the McCune SM-5.,1,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
"Serving as company vice president since 1982 and continuing as chief engineer, Cavin designed an appropriate integrated processor/amplifier package with sense lines to detect distortion, and McCune carpenter Dan Ritzo built a multi-angle version for stage monitor purposes, taking inspiration from Cavin's SM-4.",2,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
McCune's version of the UPA was the SM-5 while the monitor wedge was the SM-6.,3,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
"Upon the success of the SM-5/SM-6 project, DeLoria asked Harry McCune, Jr., to begin selling loudspeakers in addition to renting them.",4,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
"The request was denied, as McCune preferred to stay a rental house rather than become a manufacturer.",5,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
"To fill perceived market demand DeLoria started his own company in 1985, Apogee Sound in Petaluma, California, first producing the AE-5 and AE-6, DeLoria's version of the SM-5 and SM-6.",6,7,== Apogee Sound ==,61653228
