The invention of staging charts was an effort by Boris Goldovsky and his associates to (a) invent a way to annotate and preserve detailed stage directions (especially those stage directions that helped justify the musical content) and (b) expand Mr. Goldovsky’s teaching through associate or assistant stage directors.,0,15,== Goldovsky Charts ==,6573780
"As a competition-level chess player, Mr. Goldovsky began by dividing the stage into a grid of 18 squares.",0,16,== Goldovsky Charts ==,6573780
The production mechanism involved typewriters and photocopy machines: preserving enough of the score to present the vocal lines with space between systems to clarify stage directions.,1,16,== Goldovsky Charts ==,6573780

"As Mr. Goldovsky retired, the scenes would be presented directly by the various directors.",1,18,== Goldovsky Charts ==,6573780

"However discreetly they were handled, they are clearly the result of substantial labor: after defining precise stage directions, they required photocopying the piano-vocal scores, cutting the copies into systems, pasting them onto typewritten pages with the instructions interposed, and finally, copied again.",1,20,== Goldovsky Charts ==,6573780
