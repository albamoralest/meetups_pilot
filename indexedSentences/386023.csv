"Unlike the ""long telegram"", Kennan's well-timed article appearing in the July 1947 issue of Foreign Affairs under the pseudonym ""X"", titled ""The Sources of Soviet Conduct"", did not begin by emphasizing ""traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity""; instead it asserted that Stalin's policy was shaped by a combination of Marxist–Leninist ideology, which advocated revolution to defeat the capitalist forces in the outside world and Stalin's determination to use the notion of ""capitalist encirclement"" in order to legitimize his regimentation of Soviet society so that he could consolidate his political power.",0,12,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
Kennan argued that Stalin would not (and moreover could not) moderate the supposed Soviet determination to overthrow Western governments.,1,12,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023

"Kennan further argued that the United States would have to perform this containment alone but if it could do so without undermining its own economic health and political stability, the Soviet party structure would undergo a period of immense strain eventually resulting in ""either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power"".",3,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
"The publication of the ""X"" article soon began one of the more intense debates of the Cold War.",4,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
"Walter Lippmann, a leading American commentator on international affairs, strongly criticized the ""X"" article.",5,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023

Lippmann argued that diplomacy should be the basis of relations with the Soviets; he suggested that the U.S. withdraw its forces from Europe and reunify and demilitarize Germany.,7,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
"Meanwhile, it was soon revealed informally that ""X"" was indeed Kennan.",8,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023

The article did not make it obvious that Kennan favored employing political and economic rather than military methods as the chief agent of containment.,12,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
"""My thoughts about containment"" said Kennan in a 1996 interview to CNN, ""were of course distorted by the people who understood it and pursued it exclusively as a military concept; and I think that that, as much as any other cause, led to [the] 40 years of unnecessary, fearfully expensive and disoriented process of the Cold War"".",13,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023

"In a PBS television interview with David Gergen in 1996, Kennan again reiterated that he did not regard the Soviets as primarily a military threat, noting that ""they were not like Hitler"".",16,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
Kennan's opinion was that this misunderstanding:,17,14,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023
"all came down to one sentence in the ""X"" article where I said that wherever these people, meaning the Soviet leadership, confronted us with dangerous hostility anywhere in the world, we should do everything possible to contain it and not let them expand any further.",0,15,"== Cold War == | === ""X"" ===",386023

"Although Kennan regarded the Soviet Union as too weak to risk war, he nonetheless considered it an enemy capable of expanding into Western Europe through subversion, given the popular support for Communist parties in Western Europe, which remained demoralized by the devastation of the Second World War.",5,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"To counter this potential source of Soviet influence, Kennan's solution was to direct economic aid and covert political help to Japan and Western Europe to revive Western governments and assist international capitalism; by doing so the United States would help to rebuild the balance of power.",6,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023

"In 1947, Kennan supported Truman's decision to extend economic aid to the Greek government fighting a civil war against Communist guerrillas, though he argued against military aid.",8,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"The historian John Iatrides argued that Kennan's claim that the Soviet Union would go to war if the United States gave military aid to Greece is hard to square with his claim that the Soviet Union was too weak to risk war, and the real reason for his opposition to military aid was that he did not regard Greece as very important.",9,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023

"The Greek economy was traditionally dominated by a rentier system in which a few wealthy families, a highly politicized officer corps and the royal family controlled the economy for their own benefit.",19,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
Kennan's advice to open up the Greek economy was completely ignored by the Greek elite.,20,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"Kennan supported France's war to regain control of Vietnam as he argued that control of Southeast Asia with its raw materials was critical to the economic recovery of Western Europe and Japan, but by 1949, he changed his views, becoming convinced that the French would never defeat the Communist Viet Minh guerrillas.",21,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023

Kennan argued that the American people would sooner or later grow tired of occupying their zone in Germany and would inevitably demand the pull-out of U. S troops.,23,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"Or alternatively Kennan predicated the Soviets would pull their forces out of East Germany, knowing full well that they could easily return from their bases in Poland, forcing the United States to do likewise, but as the Americans lacked bases in other Western European nations, this would hand the advantage to the Soviets.",24,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"Finally, Kennan argued that the German people were very proud and would not stand having their nation occupied by foreigners for ever, making a solution to the ""German question"" imperative.",25,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"Kennan's solution was for the reunification and neutralization of Germany; the withdrawal of most of the British, American, French and Soviet forces from Germany with the exception of small enclaves near the border that would be supplied by sea; and a four-power commission from the four occupying powers would have the ultimate say while allowing the Germans to mostly govern themselves.",26,18,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
"Besides resolving the ""German question"", Kennan argued that ""program A"" would, by arranging that the remaining Red Army forces in Germany be supplied by sea, remove the principal Soviet pretext for occupying Poland and would ensure that a reunified Germany would become a ""third force"" in the Cold War aligned neither with Moscow nor Washington.",0,19,== Cold War == | === Influence under Marshall ===,386023
