"He was a leading member of the Frankfurt School of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as Ernst Bloch, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse, for whom the works of Freud, Marx, and Hegel were essential to a critique of modern society.",0,1,N/A,30391
"As a critic of both fascism and what he called the culture industry, his writings—such as Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947), Minima Moralia (1951) and Negative Dialectics (1966)—strongly influenced the European New Left.",1,1,N/A,30391
"Amidst the vogue enjoyed by existentialism and positivism in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of ontology and empiricism through studies of Kierkegaard and Husserl.",0,2,N/A,30391
"As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of Arnold Schoenberg resulted in his studying composition with Alban Berg of the Second Viennese School, Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with Thomas Mann on the latter's novel Doctor Faustus, while the two men lived in California as exiles during the Second World War.",1,2,N/A,30391
"Working for the newly relocated Institute for Social Research, Adorno collaborated on influential studies of authoritarianism, antisemitism and propaganda that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.",2,2,N/A,30391

"As a writer of polemics in the tradition of Nietzsche and Karl Kraus, Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture.",1,3,N/A,30391
"Adorno's posthumously published Aesthetic Theory, which he planned to dedicate to Samuel Beckett, is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the ""fatal separation"" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion.",2,3,N/A,30391

"His childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt: Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist.",0,7,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
He was not only a precocious child,1,7,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391

"At the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren middle school, before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gymnasium, where he studied from 1913 to 1921.",3,7,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"Prior to his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of Georg Lukács's The Theory of the Novel that year, as well as by his fascination with Ernst Bloch's The Spirit of Utopia, of which he would later write:",4,7,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
Bloch's was a philosophy that could hold its head high before the most advanced literature; a philosophy that was not calibrated to the abominable resignation of methodology ...,0,8,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"I took this motif so much as my own that I do not believe I have ever written anything without reference to it, either implicit or explicit.",1,8,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
Adorno's intellectual nonconformism was also shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism which swept through the Reich during the First World War.,0,9,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"Along with future collaborators Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer and Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany's intellectual and spiritual leaders—among them Max Weber, Max Scheler, Georg Simmel, as well as his friend Siegfried Kracauer—came out in support of the war.",1,9,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
The younger generation's distrust for traditional knowledge arose from the way in which this tradition had discredited itself.,2,9,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund's firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus & Herzberger in Berlin.",3,9,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved in the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she was acquainted with Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht and Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-1920s; after fourteen years, Gretel Karplus and Adorno were married in 1937.",4,9,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"At the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt—where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, Schreker, Stravinsky, Bartók, Busoni, Delius and Hindemith—but also began studying music composition at the Hoch Conservatory while taking private lessons with well-respected composers Bernhard Sekles and Eduard Jung.",0,10,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the Frankfurter Zeitung's literary editor, of whom he would later write:",1,10,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391

"Under his guidance I experienced the work from the beginning not as mere epistemology, not as an analysis of the conditions of scientifically valid judgments, but as a kind of coded text from which the historical situation of spirit could be read, with the vague expectation that in doing so one could acquire something of truth itself.",2,11,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"Leaving gymnasium to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with Kracauer, turning now to Hegel and Kierkegaard, and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the Zeitschrift für Musik,",0,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
the Neue Blätter für,1,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
Kunst und Literatur and later for the Musikblätter des Anbruch.,2,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"In these articles Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale, which in 1923 he called a ""dismal Bohemian prank"".",3,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"In these early writings he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances that either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence that Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible: ""No cathedral"", he wrote, ""can be built if no community desires one.""",4,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
In the summer of 1924 Adorno received his doctorate with a study of Edmund Husserl under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian Hans Cornelius.,5,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391
"Before his graduation Adorno had already met his most important intellectual collaborators, Horkheimer and Benjamin.",6,12,== Life and career == | === Early years: Frankfurt ===,30391

"During the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer Alban Berg's ""Three Fragments from Wozzeck"", op. 7, premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna.",0,14,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture that had grown up around Schoenberg: in addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with Eduard Steuermann and befriended the violinist Rudolf Kolisch.",1,14,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In Vienna he and Berg attended public lectures by the satirist Karl Kraus, and he met Lukács, who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the Hungarian Soviet Republic.",2,14,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Berg, whom Adorno called ""my master and teacher"", was among the most prescient of his young pupil's early friends:",3,14,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"[I am] convinced that, in the sphere of the deepest understanding of music ... you are capable of supreme achievements and will undoubtedly fulfill this promise in the shape of great philosophical works.",0,15,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"After leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with Kracauer, Benjamin, and the economist Alfred Sohn-Rethel, with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt.",0,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In December 1926 Adorno's ""Two Pieces for String Quartet"", op. 2, were performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the habilitation.",1,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391

"6, Adorno presented his habilitation manuscript, The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche (Der Begriff des Unbewußten in der transzendentalen Seelenlehre), to Cornelius in November 1927.",3,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application on the grounds that the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking.,4,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
In the manuscript Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the unconscious as it emerged from Freud's early writings.,5,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Against the function of the unconscious in both Nietzsche and Spengler, Adorno argued that Freud's notion of the unconscious serves as a ""sharp weapon ... against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature.""",6,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition.",7,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In addition to publishing numerous reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno's ""Four Songs for Medium Voice and Piano"", op. 3, were performed in Berlin in January 1929.",8,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the Musikblätter des Anbruch.,9,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In a proposal for transforming the journal, he sought to use Anbruch for championing radical modern music against what he called the ""stabilized music"" of Pfitzner, the later Richard Strauss, as well as the neoclassicism of Stravinsky and Hindemith.",10,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"During this period he published the essays ""Night Music"", ""On Twelve-Tone Technique"" and ""Reaction and Progress"".",11,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced.,12,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"According to Adorno, twelve-tone technique's use of atonality can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can tonality be relied on to provide instructions for the composer.",13,16,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"At this time Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer Ernst Krenek, discussing problems of atonality and twelve-tone technique.",0,17,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
In a 1934 letter he sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:,1,17,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Twelve-tone technique alone is nothing but the principle of motivic elaboration and variation, as developed in the sonata, but elevated now to a comprehensive principle of construction, namely transformed into an a priori form and, by that token, detached from the surface of the composition.",0,18,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
At this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics.,0,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present an habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title The Construction of the Aesthetic.",1,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history.",2,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like ""anxiety,"" ""inwardness"" and ""leap""—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics.",3,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work.,4,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the university conferred on Adorno the venia legendi in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.",5,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Several months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the Institute for Social Research, an independent organization that had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar Leo Lowenthal, social psychologist Erich Fromm and philosopher Herbert Marcuse, sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences.",6,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"His lecture, ""The Actuality of Philosophy,"" created a scandal.",7,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In it Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: ""For the mind,"" Adorno announced, ""is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality.""",8,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In line with Benjamin's The Origin of German Tragic Drama and preliminary sketches of the Arcades Project, Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments that should be conducted ""until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish.""",9,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might ""construct keys before which reality springs open.",10,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"""Following Horkheimer's taking up the directorship of the institute, a new journal, Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States.",11,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Though Adorno was not an Institute member, the journal published many of his essays, including ""The Social Situation of Music"" (1932), ""On Jazz"" (1936), ""On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening"" (1938) and ""Fragments on Wagner"" (1938).",12,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In his new role as social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of historical materialism, as concepts like reification, false consciousness and ideology came to play an ever more prominent role in his work.",13,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the institute, Karl Mannheim, as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like ""musical material""—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of ""value-free"" sociology in favour of a form of ideology critique that held on to an idea of truth.",14,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Before his emigration in autumn 1934, Adorno began work on a Singspiel based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer titled The Treasure of Indian Joe, which he never completed; by the time he fled Hitler's Germany Adorno had already written over 100 opera or concert reviews and 50 critiques of music composition.",15,19,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"As the Nazi party became the largest party in the Reichstag, Horkheimer's 1932 observation proved typical for his milieu: ""Only one thing is certain"", he wrote, ""the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility.""",0,20,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"In September Adorno's right to teach was revoked; in March, as the swastika was run up the flagpole of town hall, the Frankfurt criminal police searched the institute's offices.",1,20,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"Adorno's house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature denied on the grounds that membership was limited to ""persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood.",2,20,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
"As a non-Aryan,"" he was informed, ""you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation.""",3,20,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391
Soon afterwards Adorno was forced into 15 years of exile.,4,20,"== Life and career == | === Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin ===",30391

"After the possibility of transferring his habilitation to the University of Vienna came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father's suggestion.",0,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"With the help of the Academic Assistance Council, Adorno registered as an advanced student at Merton College, Oxford, in June 1934.",1,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin.",2,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Under the direction of Gilbert Ryle, Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of Husserl's epistemology.",3,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"By this time, the Institute for Social Research had relocated to New York City and begun making overtures to Adorno.",4,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"After months of strained relations, Horkheimer and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris.",5,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Adorno continued writing on music, publishing ""The Form of the Phonograph Record"" and ""Crisis of Music Criticism"" with the Viennese musical journal 23, ""On Jazz"" in the institute's Zeitschrift, ""Farewell to Jazz"" in Europäische Revue.",6,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
But Adorno's attempts to break out of the sociology of music were twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the Zeitschrift.,7,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Impressed by Horkheimer's book of aphorisms, Dawn and Decline, Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, what later became Minima Moralia.",8,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, and Berg died in December of the same year.",9,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing Berg's unfinished opera Lulu.",10,22,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
At this time Adorno was in intense correspondence with Walter Benjamin about the latter's Arcades Project.,0,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on 9 June 1937 and stayed for two weeks.",1,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"While he was in New York, Horkheimer's essays ""The Latest Attack on Metaphysics"" and ""Traditional and Critical Theory,"" which would soon become instructive for the institute's self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion.",2,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on 8 September 1937; a little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take with the Princeton Radio Project, then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld.",3,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Yet Adorno's work continued with studies of Beethoven and Richard Wagner (published in 1939 as ""Fragments on Wagner""), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera.",4,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for ""the precision of their materialist deciphering"" as well as the way in which ""musical facts ... had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me.""",5,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize Dialectic of Enlightenment—man's domination of nature—first emerges.",6,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
Adorno sailed for New York on 16 February 1938.,7,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in Newark, New Jersey, to discuss the Project's plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music.",8,23,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Although he was expected to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with data collection to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them.",0,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment: ""I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it.""",1,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, ""Music in Radio.""",2,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life.,3,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"""The meaning of a Beethoven symphony,"" he wrote, ""heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where people sit as if they were in church.""",4,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"In essays published by the institute's Zeitschrift, Adorno dealt with the atrophy of musical culture that had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—toward conformism, trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture.",5,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project.",6,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was left out.",7,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
"Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was prolific, publishing ""The Radio Symphony"", ""A Social Critique of Radio Music"", and ""On Popular Music"", texts that, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's translation, Current of Music.",8,24,"== Life and career == | === Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles ===",30391
