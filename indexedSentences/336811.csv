Hines may go along like this in a medium tempo blues.,3,34,== Biography == | === Rediscovery ===,336811
"He will play the first two choruses softly and out of tempo, unreeling placid chords that safely hold the kernel of the melody.",4,34,== Biography == | === Rediscovery ===,336811

"(There are so many push-me, pull-you contrasts going on in such a chorus that it is impossible to grasp it one time through.)",8,34,== Biography == | === Rediscovery ===,336811
In the next chorus—bang!—up goes the volume again and Hines breaks into a crazy-legged double-time-and-a-half run that may make several sweeps up and down the keyboard and that are punctuated by offbeat single notes in the left hand.,9,34,== Biography == | === Rediscovery ===,336811
"Then he will throw in several fast descending two-fingered glissandos, go abruptly into an arrhythmic swirl of chords and short, broken, runs and, as abruptly as he began it all, ease into an interlude of relaxed chords and poling single notes.",10,34,== Biography == | === Rediscovery ===,336811

"The Oxford Companion to Jazz describes Hines as ""the most important pianist in the transition from stride to swing"" and continues:",0,41,== Style ==,336811
"As he matured through the 1920s, he simplified the stride ""orchestral piano"", eventually arriving at a prototypical swing style.",0,42,== Style ==,336811
"The right hand no longer developed syncopated patterns around pivot notes (as in ragtime) or between-the-hands figuration (as in stride) but instead focused on a more directed melodic line, often doubled at the octave with phrase-ending tremolos.",1,42,== Style ==,336811
"This line was called the ""trumpet"" right hand because of its markedly hornlike character but in fact the general trend toward a more linear style can be traced back through stride and Jelly Roll Morton to late ragtime from 1915 to 1920.",2,42,== Style ==,336811
Hines himself described meeting Armstrong:,0,43,== Style ==,336811
Louis looked at me so peculiar.,0,44,== Style ==,336811
"So I said, ""Am I making the wrong chords?""",1,44,== Style ==,336811
"And he said, ""No, but your style is like mine"".",2,44,== Style ==,336811
"So I said, ""Well, I wanted to play trumpet but it used to hurt me behind my ears so I played on the piano what I wanted to play on the trumpet"".",3,44,== Style ==,336811
"And he said, ""No, no, that's my style, that's what I like.""",4,44,== Style ==,336811
Hines continued:,0,45,== Style ==,336811
...,0,46,== Style ==,336811
I was curious and wanted to know what the chords were made of.,1,46,== Style ==,336811
I would begin to play like the other instruments.,2,46,== Style ==,336811
"But in those days we didn't have amplification, so the singers used to use megaphones and they didn't have grand-pianos for us to use at the time – it was an upright.",3,46,== Style ==,336811
"So when they gave me a solo, playing single fingers like I was doing, in those great big halls they could hardly hear me.",4,46,== Style ==,336811
So I had to think of something so I could cut through the big-band.,5,46,== Style ==,336811
So I started to use what they call 'trumpet-style' – which was octaves.,6,46,== Style ==,336811
Then they could hear me out front,7,46,== Style ==,336811
and that's what changed the style of piano playing at that particular time.,8,46,== Style ==,336811
"In their book Jazz (2009), Gary Giddins and Scott DeVeaux wrote of Hines's style of the time:",0,47,== Style ==,336811
"To make [himself] audible, [Hines] developed an ability to improvise in tremolos (the speedy alternation of two or more notes, creating a pianistic version of the brass man's vibrato) and octaves or tenths: instead of hitting one note at a time with his right hand, he hit two and with vibrantly percussive force – his reach was so large that jealous competitors spread the ludicrous rumor that he had had the webbing between his fingers surgically removed.",0,48,== Style ==,336811
"In his book Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism, Thomas Brothers described Hines' style:Rhythmically, Hines was very good at taking his melodic lines further and further way from the fixed foundation, creating a radical sense of detachment for a few beats or measures, only to land back in time with great aplomb when finished with his foray.",0,49,== Style ==,336811
The left hand sometimes joins in the action...,1,49,== Style ==,336811
What is especially distinctive about Hines are the startling effects he creates by harmonically enhancing these rhythmic departures.,2,49,== Style ==,336811
"Like Armstrong, he thought of chords creatively and with great precision.",3,49,== Style ==,336811
But he was a step ahead of his colleague in his willingness to experiment.,4,49,== Style ==,336811
"He became fond of radical dislocations, sudden turns of directions with dim and nonexistent connection to the ground harmony.",5,49,== Style ==,336811
Pianist Teddy Wilson wrote of Hines's style:,6,49,== Style ==,336811
Hines was both a great soloist and a great rhythm player.,0,50,== Style ==,336811
He has a beautiful powerful rhythmic approach to the keyboard and his rhythms are more eccentric than those of Art Tatum or Fats Waller.,1,50,== Style ==,336811
"When I say eccentric, I mean getting away from straight 4/4 rhythm.",2,50,== Style ==,336811
He would play a lot of what we now call 'accent on the and beat'.,3,50,== Style ==,336811
...,4,50,== Style ==,336811
"It was a subtle use of syncopation, playing on the in-between beats or what I might call and beats: one-and-two-and-three-and-four-and.",5,50,== Style ==,336811
"The and between ""one-two-three-four"" is implied, When counted in music, the and becomes what are called eighth notes.",6,50,== Style ==,336811
"So you get eight notes to a bar instead of four, although they're spaced out in the time of four.",7,50,== Style ==,336811
Hines would come in on those and beats with the most eccentric patterns that propelled the rhythm forward with such tremendous force that people felt an irresistible urge to dance or tap their feet or otherwise react physically to the rhythm of the music. ...,8,50,== Style ==,336811
Hines is very intricate in his rhythm patterns: very unusual and original and there is really nobody like him.,9,50,== Style ==,336811
That makes him a giant of originality.,10,50,== Style ==,336811
"He could produce improvised piano solos which could cut through to perhaps 2,000 dancing people just like a trumpet or a saxophone could.",11,50,== Style ==,336811
"Oliver Jackson was Hines's frequent drummer (as well as a drummer for Oscar Peterson, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Teddy Wilson and many others",0,51,== Style ==,336811
"Jackson says that Earl Hines and Erroll Garner (whose approach to playing piano, he says, came from Hines) were the two musicians he found exceptionally difficult to accompany.",0,52,== Style ==,336811
Why?,1,52,== Style ==,336811
“They could play in like two or three different tempos at one time …,2,52,== Style ==,336811
"The left hand would be in one meter and the right hand would be in another meter and then you have to watch their pedal technique because they would hit the sustaining pedal and notes are ringing here and that’s one tempo going on when he puts the sustaining pedal on, and then this hand is moving, his left hand is moving, maybe playing tenths, and this hand is playing like quarter-note triplets or sixteenth notes.",3,52,== Style ==,336811
So you got this whole conglomeration of all these different tempos going on”.,4,52,== Style ==,336811
"Of Hines's later style, The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz says of Hines' 1965 style:",0,53,== Style ==,336811
[Hines] uses his left hand sometimes for accents and figures that would only come from a full trumpet section.,0,54,== Style ==,336811
Sometimes he will play chords that would have been written and played by five saxophones in harmony.,1,54,== Style ==,336811
"But he is always the virtuoso pianist with his arpeggios, his percussive attack and his fantastic ability to modulate from one song to another as if they were all one song and he just created all those melodies during his own improvisation.",2,54,== Style ==,336811
"Later still, then in his seventies and after a host of recent solo recordings, Hines himself said:",0,55,== Style ==,336811
I'm an explorer if I might use that expression.,0,56,== Style ==,336811
I'm looking for something all the time.,1,56,== Style ==,336811
And oft-times I get lost.,2,56,== Style ==,336811
"And people that are around me a lot know that when they see me smiling, they know I'm lost and I'm trying to get back.",3,56,== Style ==,336811
But it makes it much more interesting because then you do things that surprise yourself.,4,56,== Style ==,336811
"And after you hear the recording, it makes you a little bit happy too because you say, ""Oh, I didn't know I could do THAT!""",5,56,== Style ==,336811
