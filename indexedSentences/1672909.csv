Deutsch has discovered a number of illusions of music and speech related to sound perception and memory.,0,5,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
They show that there are remarkable variations in how people perceive music.,1,5,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Some of these variations relate to differences in brain organization, and others relate to the listeners' languages and dialects.",2,5,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"The illusions also demonstrate the importance of memory, knowledge and expectations to how we perceive music and speech, and point to strong connections between the brain systems responsible for these two forms of communication.",3,5,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"One set of illusions occur when two sequences of tones are presented via stereo headphones, such that when the right ear receives one sequence the left ear receives a different sequence.",0,6,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Using this procedure, Deutsch discovered striking illusions – in particular the octave illusion, the scale illusion, the chromatic illusion, the glissando illusion, and the cambiata illusion.",1,6,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"She discovered that there are strong disagreements between listeners in how these illusions are perceived, and that these disagreements tend to occur between righthanders and lefthanders, indicating that they reflect differences in brain organization.",2,6,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
These illusions have implications for musical practice.,3,6,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"For example, on listening to music in concert halls, different members of an audience may experience the same musical patterns in different ways.",4,6,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
The illusions also demonstrate the existence of illusory conjunctions in hearing.,5,6,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Deutsch also produced illusions using sequences of tones that were clearly defined in terms of pitch class (note name), but ambiguous in terms of which octave they are in (known as Shepard tones).",0,7,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"In particular, she discovered the tritone paradox.",1,7,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Perception of this illusion again differs substantially from one listener to another, but in this case, perceptual variations relate to the language or dialect spoken by the listener, indicating a relationship between music and speech.",2,7,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"In addition, Deutsch discovered the Speech-to-Song Illusion.",0,8,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"In this illusion, speech is made to be heard as song, and this is occurs without transforming the sounds in any way, but simply by repeating a phrase several times over.",1,8,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
This illusion also points to a strong relationship between speech and music.,2,8,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Two further illusions discovered by Deutsch also show the importance of unconscious inference – our use of memory, beliefs and expectations – in perception of music and speech.",0,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
One is called the mysterious melody illusion.,1,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Listeners are unable to identify a well-known melody when all its note names are correct, but the tones are placed randomly in different octaves.",2,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"However, when listeners are told the identity of the melody, they can then draw on their stored knowledge so as to recognize it.",3,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
Another is the phantom words illusion.,4,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"Using stereo loudspeakers, Deutsch presented repeating words and phrases that were composed of two syllables.",5,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
The syllables alternated between the speakers such that when one syllable came from the speaker on the right the other syllable came from the speaker on the left.,6,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909
"When listening to such sequences, listeners 'heard' words and phrases that had not been presented; often these 'phantom words' were related to their memories and expectations.",7,9,== Research and theory == | === Illusions of music and speech ===,1672909

==,2,10,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
"Deutsch's research also focuses on absolute pitch (or perfect pitch), which is the ability to name or produce a musical note without the aid of a reference note.",0,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
"This ability is very rare in the United States, but Deutsch discovered that it is far more prevalent among speakers of tone language, such as Mandarin or Vietnamese.",1,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
"Deutsch proposed that, if given the opportunity, infants can acquire absolute pitch as a feature of their language, and this ability carries over into music.",2,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
"This proposal has inspired a substantial body of work on absolute pitch, and on pitch perception in relation to language.",3,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
Deutsch and Dooley also found that speakers of English with absolute pitch had unusually large digit spans for spoken words.,4,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
"They proposed that this strong verbal memory makes it easier to develop an association between musical notes and their names in early childhood, and so to acquire absolute pitch.",5,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909
This proposal also links absolute pitch (and therefore music) to language.,6,11,== Research and theory == | === Absolute pitch ===,1672909

Deutsch has carried out extensive research on memory for sequences of tones.,0,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
"She demonstrated that short-term memory for the pitch of a tone is the function of a specialized and highly organized system, where information is not subject to interference by other sounds such as spoken words.",1,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
Deutsch also published one of the earliest neural networks for musical pattern recognition.,2,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
"Later, Deutsch and Feroe published a theoretical model for the representation of pitch sequences in tonal music, in which pitch sequences are represented as hierarchies.",3,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
The model proposes that elements are organized as structural units at each level of a hierarchy.,4,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
Elements that are present at each level are elaborated by other elements so as to create structural units at the next lower level.,5,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
This process of elaboration continues until the lowest level is reached.,6,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
The model has been used by others as a basis for more elaborate models for the representation of musical sequences.,7,13,"== Research and theory == | === Memory for musical tones, and representation of musical structure ===",1672909
