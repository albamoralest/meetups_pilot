"Soon he was accurately emulating Katz's playing style and the Jack Melick Orchestra became known as the ""best Jewish band"" in town.",1,40,== The Hollywood years == | === Dallas career ===,38231518
Melick's principal rival in the society band business was a band leader and arranger named Mal Fitch.,2,40,== The Hollywood years == | === Dallas career ===,38231518
"While Melick's home venue was the Chaparral Club, Fitch was the principal act at the Cipango Club.",3,40,== The Hollywood years == | === Dallas career ===,38231518

"As societal trends changed more and more away from the pure big bands, Melick found an opportunity to co-exist with the new sounds of the 1960s and beyond at weddings, debutante parties, and other social events.",0,41,== The Hollywood years == | === Dallas career ===,38231518
