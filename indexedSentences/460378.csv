"Moreschi's Director at the Sistine was Domenico Mustafà, himself once a fine castrato soprano, who realised that Moreschi was, amongst other things, the only hope for the continuation of the Sistine tradition of performing the famous setting of the Miserere by Gregorio Allegri during Holy Week.",0,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"When Moreschi joined the Sistine choir, there were still six other castrato members, but none of them was capable of sustaining this work's taxing soprano tessitura.",1,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"Moreschi's star status sometimes seems to have turned his head: ""Moreschi's behaviour was often capricious enough to make him forget a proper professional bearing, as on the occasion after a concert when he paraded himself among the crowd like a peacock, with a long, white scarf, to be congratulated ...",2,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378

"This entire period was one of great upheaval within the Sistine choir's organisation as well as Catholic church music at large: the reforming movement known as Cecilianism, which had originated in Germany, was beginning to have its influence felt in Rome.",8,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
Its calls for the Church's music to return to the twin bases of Gregorian chant and the polyphony of Palestrina were a direct threat to both the repertoire and the practice of the Sistine Chapel.,9,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378

"Moreschi was very much a silent witness to the struggles between the forces of tradition and reform, but was also caught up in secular matters: on 9 August 1900, at the express request of the Italian royal family, he sang at the funeral of the recently assassinated king, Umberto I. This was all the more extraordinary because the Papacy still had no formal contact with the Italian secular state, which it regarded as a mere usurper (see Unification of Italy).In the spring of 1902, in the Vatican, Moreschi made the first of his recordings for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company of London.",13,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
He made additional recordings in 1904: there are seventeen tracks in all.,14,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378

"His successor was Pope Pius X, an equally powerful advocate of Cecilianism.",16,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"One of the new pontiff's first official acts was the promulgation of the motu proprio, Tra le sollecitudini (""Amidst the Cares""), which appeared, appropriately enough, on St Cecilia's Day, 22 November 1903.",17,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"This was the final nail in the coffin of all that Mustafà, Moreschi and their colleagues stood for, since one of its decrees stated: ""Whenever ... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the Church.""",18,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"Perosi, a fanatical opponent of the castrati, had triumphed and Moreschi and his few remaining colleagues were to be pensioned off and replaced by boys.",19,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"A singing pupil of Moreschi's, Domenico Mancini, was such a good imitator of his master's voice that Perosi took him for a castrato (for all that castration had been banned in Italy in 1870), and would have nothing to do with him.",20,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
Mancini became a professional double-bass player.,21,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"Officially, Alessandro was a member of the Sistine choir until Easter 1913 (at which date he qualified for his pension after thirty years' service), and remained in the choir of the Cappella Giulia of St Peter's, Rome until a year after that.",22,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378
"Around Easter 1914 he met the Viennese musicologist Franz Haböck, author of the important book Die Kastraten und ihre Gesangskunst (The Castrati and their Art of Singing, published in Berlin in 1927), who had plans to cast Moreschi in concerts reviving the repertoire of the great eighteenth-century castrato Farinelli.",23,8,== Sistine Chapel choir ==,460378

"Critical opinion is divided about Moreschi's recordings: some say  they are of little interest other than the novelty of preserving the voice of a castrato, and that Moreschi was a mediocre singer, while others detect the remains of a talented singer unfortunately past his prime by the time he recorded.",0,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
(Moreschi was in his mid-forties when he made his recordings.),1,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"Still others feel that he was a very fine singer indeed, and that much of the ""difficulty"" in listening to Moreschi's recordings stems from changes in taste and singing style between his time and ours.",2,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"His vocal technique can certainly seem to grate upon modern ears, but many of the seemingly imperfect vocal attacks, for example, are in fact grace notes, launched from as much as a tenth below the note – in Moreschi's case, this seems to have been a long-standing means of drawing on the particular acoustics of the Sistine Chapel itself.",3,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"The dated aesthetic of Moreschi's singing, involving extreme passion and a perpetual type of sob, often sounds bizarre to the modern listener, and can be misinterpreted as technical weakness or symptomatic of an aging voice.",4,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"The standard of his recordings is certainly variable; Moreschi recorded two versions of Rossini's ""Crucifixus"".",5,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"In the first, Moreschi's first side from his first recording session in 1902, he sings off key, and continues to do so for several bars.",6,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"Whatever modern opinion may be of his recordings, the enthusiastic applause of his colleagues attests to their appreciation on at least one occasion, as can be heard at the end of his rendering of Tosti's song ""Ideale"".",7,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"The best-known piece Moreschi recorded is the Bach/Gounod ""Ave Maria"" (though the Sistine Chapel choir recorded Mozart's Ave verum corpus, Moreschi's voice is not individually audible).",8,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
"Perhaps only here does Moreschi's singing approach the type of star quality that the great castrato performances of the Baroque era must have possessed; there is great fervour in the singing – the above-mentioned ""tear in every note"" – and Moreschi takes the climactic high B natural without apparent effort.",9,16,== Critical opinion ==,460378
