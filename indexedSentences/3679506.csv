Among his innovations in the field of organ design were improvements to electro-pneumatic action and the invention of such stops as the Diaphone and the modern Tibia Clausa with its strong 8′ flute tone.,5,6,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
The Tibia eventually became a staple of theatre organs.,6,6,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506

"Diaphone was less successful, but made an impression on audiences of the era.",8,6,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"Hope-Jones organs were also noted for such innovations as stoptabs instead of drawknobs, and very high wind pressures of 10″–50″ to imitate orchestral instruments.",0,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"He used expression liberally, sometimes enclosing the entire organ behind thick swell shades for great expressive power.",1,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
He also used a system of unification which multiplied considerably the number of stops relative to the number of ranks.,2,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"With a background in telephone engineering, Hope-Jones brought electrification of the organ to a degree of refinement, first applying many of his ideas to instruments intended for churches or concert halls.",3,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"The concept of unification in organ design involves applying couplers, often at three or four pitches, to an individual rank of pipes.",4,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"By extending the compass of a rank from the customary 61 pipes (one for each manual key) to 85 or 97 (thus adding an octave below unison pitch and one or two octaves above), and supplying the necessary relays and wiring, the builder of an electrified (often, more precisely, electropneumatic) organ could multiply the tonal resources of the instrument severalfold without adding more ranks of pipes.",5,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
Mutation stops such as the octave fifth (at an interval of a twelfth) and the superoctave third (seventeenth) could be derived from the same rank with equal facility.,6,7,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"A single 97-pipe extended rank, playable at each of four pitches on each of three manuals and at three pitches on the pedal, would thus be represented on the console by no fewer than fifteen stop tabs.",0,8,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
Herein lies the secret of the “mighty” Wurlitzer.,1,8,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"A Unit Orchestra with six ranks (diapason, flute, string, trumpet, vox humana, clarinet) might have more stops at the console than a traditional concert instrument of one hundred ranks.",2,8,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
Hope-Jones’s contributions to organ design were not limited to ingenious wiring schemes.,0,9,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
He held numerous patents for innovations and improvements in various phases of organ design.,1,9,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"He invented the familiar tongue-shaped stop tablets, the horseshoe-shaped stop rail, and double-touch (adding more assertive stops when a given key is depressed more deeply than usual), all of which became standard features of Wurlitzer and other theatre organs produced in the U.S. and abroad during the silent film era.",2,9,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"He is also credited with inventing or developing several voices, including some that are unique to theatre-organ sound, such as the tibia clausa, a large-scaled stopped flute typically played with extreme tremolo; the diaphone, a powerful bass stop with a moving valve-like resonator in the mouth of each pipe; and close imitations of several orchestral instruments.",0,10,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506
"Other features characteristic of the theatre organ in which Hope-Jones played a pioneering role were the installation of various sets of pipes in separate recesses below or adjacent to the stage, thus achieving a primitive stereophonic effect; the placement of all divisions under expression, that is, enclosing all pipes in sound-tight boxes (often built of concrete) with pedal-controlled shutters, permitting wide variations in loudness; richer and deeper tremolo effects than were customary in church or concert instruments; high-powered centrifugal blowers capable of providing adequate wind for pipes voiced at 10 or more inches of water; tuned percussions such as marimba, xylophone, harp, glockenspiel, and cathedral chimes; bass, kettle, and snare drums, gongs, tambourine, castanets, and cymbals; “toy counter” effects for use in accompanying silent films, including doorbell, bird call, auto horn, sleigh bells, train whistle, thunder, and galloping hooves; and even a grand piano.",0,11,== Organbuilding innovations ==,3679506

"At the instigation of R. P. Elliot, the organiser, vice-president and secretary of the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Conn., Hope-Jones decided to remain in the US and join that corporation, taking the office of vice-president.",1,13,== United States ==,3679506
"Subsequently a new firm, Hope-Jones & Harrison, was tentatively formed in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in July 1904; but as sufficient capital could not be obtained, in 1905 Hope-Jones and his corps of skilled employees joined the Ernest M. Skinner Company, of Boston, Hope-Jones taking the office of vice-president.",2,13,== United States ==,3679506
"Working in connection with the Skinner Company, Hope-Jones constructed and placed a fine organ in Park Church, Elmira, New York, erected in memory of Thomas K. Beecher.",3,13,== United States ==,3679506
"He there met Jervis Langdon, treasurer of the Elmira Chamber of Commerce, who secured the industry for his city by organizing a corporation to build exclusively Hope-Jones organs.",4,13,== United States ==,3679506
"This ""Hope-Jones Organ Company"" was established in February 1907, the year of a financial panic.",5,13,== United States ==,3679506

"In early 1908, Hope-Jones was arrested upon complaint of the mother of a boy, age 15, who worked at the organ factory and was molested.",0,14,== United States ==,3679506
Hope-Jones subsequently paid the $500 fine with company money which deterred future investment and led to the firm's demise.,1,14,== United States ==,3679506
"The patents and plant of the Elmira concern were acquired by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company in April 1910, and Hope-Jones entered its employ, with headquarters at its mammoth factory at North Tonawanda, New York, continuing to carry on the business under his own name.",2,14,== United States ==,3679506
Hope-Jones was a poor businessman and tended to operate his affairs without regard to profitability.,3,14,== United States ==,3679506
The Wurlitzers took a very dim view of this and eventually forced him to work outside the factory when he became disagreeable.,4,14,== United States ==,3679506
They had him bound by a contract and were fearful of his working for other firms if he was terminated.,5,14,== United States ==,3679506
