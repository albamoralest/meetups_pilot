Louis Braille ( (listen); French: [lwi bʁaj]; 4 January 1809 – 6 January 1852) was a French educator and inventor of a reading and writing system for use by people who are visually impaired.,0,0,N/A,61410
"His system remains virtually unchanged to this day, and is known worldwide simply as braille.",1,0,N/A,61410
Braille was blinded at the age of three in one eye as a result of an accident with a stitching awl in his father's harness making shop.,0,1,N/A,61410
"Consequently, an infection set in and spread to both eyes, resulting in total blindness.",1,1,N/A,61410
"At that time there were not many resources in place for the blind but nevertheless, he excelled in his education and received a scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth.",2,1,N/A,61410
"While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently.",3,1,N/A,61410
"Inspired by the system invented by Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method that was more compact and lent itself to a range of uses, including music.",4,1,N/A,61410
He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.,5,1,N/A,61410
"In adulthood, Louis Braille served as a professor at the Institute and had an avocation as a musician, but he largely spent the remainder of his life refining and extending his system.",0,2,N/A,61410
"It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.",1,2,N/A,61410

"Louis Braille was born in Coupvray, a small town about twenty miles east of Paris, on 4 January 1809.",0,4,== Early life ==,61410
"He and his three elder siblings – Monique Catherine (b. 1793), Louis-Simon (b. 1795), and Marie Céline (b. 1797) – lived with their parents, Simon-René and Monique, on three hectares of land and vineyard in the countryside.",1,4,== Early life ==,61410
Simon-René maintained a successful enterprise as a leatherer and maker of horse tack.,2,4,== Early life ==,61410
"As soon as he could walk, Braille's time was spent playing in his father's workshop.",3,4,== Early life ==,61410
"At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl.",4,4,== Early life ==,61410
"Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and stabbed him in one of his eyes.",5,4,== Early life ==,61410
"A local physician bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ.",6,4,== Early life ==,61410
"In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected.",7,4,== Early life ==,61410
"He eventually lost sight in the other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.aLouis Braille survived the torment of the infection but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes.",8,4,== Early life ==,61410
"Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark.",9,4,== Early life ==,61410
"His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care.",10,4,== Early life ==,61410
"He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability.",11,4,== Early life ==,61410
