Celibidache's approach to music-making is often described more by what he did not do instead of what he did.,0,9,== Performance style ==,317532
"For example, much has been made of Celibidache's ""refusal"" to make recordings even though almost all of his concert activity actually was recorded with many released posthumously by major labels such as EMI and Deutsche Grammophon with the consent of his family.",1,9,== Performance style ==,317532
"Nevertheless, Celibidache paid little attention to making these recordings, which he viewed merely as by-products of his orchestral concerts.",2,9,== Performance style ==,317532
"Celibidache's focus was instead on creating, during each concert, the optimal conditions for what he called a ""transcendent experience"".",0,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"Aspects of Zen Buddhism, such as ichi-go ichi-e, strongly influenced his thinking.",1,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"He believed that transcendental experiences were extremely unlikely to ensue when listening to recorded music, so he eschewed them.",2,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"As a result, some of his concerts did provide audiences with exceptional and sometimes life-altering experiences, including, for example, a 1984 concert in Carnegie Hall by the Orchestra of the Curtis Institute that New York Times critic John Rockwell touted as the best of his 25 years of concert-going.",3,10,== Performance style ==,317532
Celibidache was well known for his demands for extensive rehearsal time with orchestras.,4,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"An oft-mentioned feature of many of his later concerts, captured in the live recordings of them, is a slower tempo than what is considered the norm, while in fast passages (especially in his earlier performances)",5,10,== Performance style ==,317532
his tempi often exceeded metronome markings by far.,6,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"In Celibidache's own view, however, criticism of a recording's tempo is irrelevant, as it is not (and cannot be) a critique of the performance but rather of a transcription of it, without the ambience of the moment, for him, a key factor in any musical performance.",7,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"As Celibidache explained, the acoustic space in which one hears a concert directly affects the likelihood of the emergence of his sought-after transcendent experience.",8,10,== Performance style ==,317532
"The acoustic space within which one hears a recording of one of his performances, on the other hand, has no impact on the performance, as it is impossible for the acoustic features of that space to stimulate musicians to play slower or faster.",9,10,== Performance style ==,317532
That his recorded performances differ so widely from the majority of other recordings has led them to be seen by some as collectors' items rather than mainstream releases and 'one-offs' rather than reference recordings.,0,11,== Performance style ==,317532
