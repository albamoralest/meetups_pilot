"Al-Kindi theorized that there was a separate, incorporeal and universal intellect (known as the ""First Intellect"").",0,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
It was the first of God's creation and the intermediary through which all other things came into creation.,1,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"Aside from its obvious metaphysical importance, it was also crucial to al-Kindi's epistemology, which was influenced by Platonic realism.",2,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"According to Plato, everything that exists in the material world corresponds to certain universal forms in the heavenly realm.",3,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"These forms are really abstract concepts such as a species, quality or relation, which apply to all physical objects and beings.",4,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"For example, a red apple has the quality of ""redness"" derived from the appropriate universal.",5,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"However, al-Kindi says that human intellects are only potentially able to comprehend these.",6,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"This potential is actualized by the First Intellect, which is perpetually thinking about all of the universals.",7,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
He argues that the external agency of this intellect is necessary by saying that human beings cannot arrive at a universal concept merely through perception.,8,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"In other words, an intellect cannot understand the species of a thing simply by examining one or more of its instances.",9,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"According to him, this will only yield an inferior ""sensible form"", and not the universal form which we desire.",10,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
The universal form can only be attained through contemplation and actualization by the First Intellect.,11,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
The analogy he provides to explain his theory is that of wood and fire.,12,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this.",13,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"This means that for the human intellect to think about something, the First Intellect must already be thinking about it.",14,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"Therefore, he says that the First Intellect must always be thinking about everything.",15,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065
"Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's ""acquired intellect"" and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.",16,43,== Philosophical thought == | === Epistemology ===,272065

"To explain the nature of our worldly existence, he (borrowing from Epictetus) compares it to a ship which has, during the course of its ocean voyage, temporarily anchored itself at an island and allowed its passengers to disembark.",1,45,== Philosophical thought == | === The soul and the afterlife ===,272065
The implicit warning is that those passengers who linger too long on the island may be left behind when the ship sets sail again.,2,45,== Philosophical thought == | === The soul and the afterlife ===,272065
"Here, al-Kindi displays a stoic concept, that we must not become attached to material things (represented by the island), as they will invariably be taken away from us (when the ship sets sail again).",3,45,== Philosophical thought == | === The soul and the afterlife ===,272065
"He then connects this with a Neo-Platonist idea, by saying that our soul can be directed towards the pursuit of desire or the pursuit of intellect; the former will tie it to the body, so that when the body dies, it will also die, but the latter will free it from the body and allow it to survive ""in the light of the Creator"" in a realm of pure intelligence.",4,45,== Philosophical thought == | === The soul and the afterlife ===,272065

"In the view of al-Kindi, prophecy and philosophy were two different routes to arrive at the truth.",0,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
He contrasts the two positions in four ways.,1,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Firstly, while a person must undergo a long period of training and study to become a philosopher, prophecy is bestowed upon someone by God.",2,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Secondly, the philosopher must arrive at the truth by his own devices (and with great difficulty), whereas the prophet has the truth revealed to him by God.",3,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Thirdly, the understanding of the prophet – being divinely revealed – is clearer and more comprehensive than that of the philosopher.",4,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Fourthly, the way in which the prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior.",5,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Therefore, al-Kindi says the prophet is superior in two fields: the ease and certainty with which he receives the truth, and the way in which he presents it.",6,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"However, the crucial implication is that the content of the prophet's and the philosopher's knowledge is the same.",7,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"This, says Adamson, demonstrates how limited the superiority al-Kindi afforded to prophecy was.",8,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"In addition to this, al-Kindi adopted a naturalistic view of prophetic visions.",9,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"He argued that, through the faculty of ""imagination"" as conceived of in Aristotelian philosophy, certain ""pure"" and well-prepared souls, were able to receive information about future events.",10,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Significantly, he does not attribute such visions or dreams to revelation from God, but instead explains that imagination enables human beings to receive the ""form"" of something without needing to perceive the physical entity to which it refers.",11,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065
"Therefore, it would seem to imply that anyone who has purified themselves would be able to receive such visions.",12,47,== Philosophical thought == | === The relationship between revelation and philosophy ===,272065

"But it would be incorrect to assume that they opposed philosophy simply because it was a ""foreign science"".",1,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
"Oliver Leaman, an expert on Islamic philosophy, points out that the objections of notable theologians are rarely directed at philosophy itself, but rather at the conclusions the philosophers arrived at.",2,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
"Even al-Ghazali, who is famous for his critique of the philosophers, was himself an expert in philosophy and logic.",3,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
And his criticism was that they arrived at theologically erroneous conclusions.,4,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
"The three most serious of these, in his view, were believing in the co-eternity of the universe with God, denying the bodily resurrection, and asserting that God only has knowledge of abstract universals, not of particular things (not all philosophers subscribed to these same views).",5,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
"During his life, al-Kindi was fortunate enough to enjoy the patronage of the pro-Mutazilite Caliphs al-Ma'mun and al-Mu'tasim, which meant he could carry out his philosophical speculations with relative ease.",6,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
"In his own time, al-Kindi would be criticized for extolling the ""intellect"" as being the most immanent creation in proximity to God, which was commonly held to be the position of the angels.",7,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
"He also engaged in disputations with certain Mutazilites, whom he attacked for their belief in atoms, as not all Mutazilites accepted the belief of atomism.",8,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
But the real role of al-Kindi in the conflict between philosophers and theologians would be to prepare the ground for debate.,9,49,== Philosophical thought == | === Critics and patrons ===,272065
