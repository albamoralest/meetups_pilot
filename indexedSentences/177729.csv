Several critics have challenged the notion that Zeppo did not develop a comic persona in his films.,1,21,== Legacy ==,177729
"James Agee considered Zeppo ""a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man.""",2,21,== Legacy ==,177729
"Along similar lines, Gerald Mast, in his book The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies, noted that Zeppo's comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers', was undeniably present:",3,21,== Legacy ==,177729
"[He] added a fourth dimension as the cliché of the [romantic] juvenile, the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage. ...",0,22,== Legacy ==,177729
"[He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be taken seriously.",1,22,== Legacy ==,177729
"While this interpretation of Zeppo's comedic contributions could seemingly be considered a contemporary reappraisal of his role in the Paramount pictures, more astute film reviewers were apparently in on the joke as far back as the release of I'll Say She Is, the team's 1924 Broadway hit.",0,23,== Legacy ==,177729
"In its review of the play, The New York Daily News calls Zeppo ""the obliging audience of the family – the feeder who helps his brothers be funny by playing straight himself.""",1,23,== Legacy ==,177729
"When The New York Times reviewed their debut film The Cocoanuts in 1929, it ranked all four Marx Brothers equally – ""When the four Marx brothers are on the screen, it's a riot"" [emphasis added] – and went on to describe each of the brothers' unique style of comedy, and praised Zeppo as ""the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.",2,23,== Legacy ==,177729
"""In his essay ""The Marx Brothers: From Vaudeville to Hollywood,"" Roger S. Bader observes that the films that the Marx Brothers made as a trio after Zeppo left the group should generally be considered a different comedy team altogether, noting that ""changes in the Marx Brothers’ screen personas [were] immediate and apparent,"" with less of vaudevillian-inspired anarchy and more in tune with standard Hollywood comedies where ""love stories [were] injected in the plots [to] make their films more palatable to female moviegoers.""",3,23,== Legacy ==,177729
Bader notes Zeppo's absence as a symptom of his older brothers' watered-down new act:,4,23,== Legacy ==,177729
Their zaniness and anarchy would be heavily diluted at M-G-M as the studio found them a wider audience.,0,24,== Legacy ==,177729
… These are not vaudeville’s Marx Brothers.,1,24,== Legacy ==,177729
"But in the Paramount films they certainly are the Marx Brothers of the stage – the FOUR Marx Brothers, as Minnie intended them to be.",2,24,== Legacy ==,177729
"While Zeppo may not be as busy as his brothers, they function best as a quartet.",3,24,== Legacy ==,177729
"Groucho may have had other capable straight men, but when Zeppo takes a letter to the honorable Charles H. Hoongerdoonger, Marx Brothers fans know he’s the best man for the job.",4,24,== Legacy ==,177729
… Those five films are one of the last links to the era when vaudeville was the primary form of entertainment in America – and the Four Marx Brothers were packing vaudeville theaters across the country.,5,24,== Legacy ==,177729
"Of course they were still great as a trio in their later films, but if you want to know what it was like to see them on stage, you need to start with four of them – and their first five films.",6,24,== Legacy ==,177729
"In her book Hello, I Must be Going: Groucho & His Friends, Charlotte Chandler defended Zeppo as being ""the Marx Brothers' interpreter in the worlds they invaded.",0,25,== Legacy ==,177729
"He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did Margaret Dumont.",1,25,== Legacy ==,177729
Zeppo's importance to the Marx Brothers' initial success was as a Marx Brother who could 'pass' as a normal person.,2,25,== Legacy ==,177729

"Chandler's appraisal of Zeppo's role in the films – as an interpreter for his older brothers to the audience – was essentially confirmed by Groucho himself, who once noted that Zeppo's role was ""handsome, obtuse, slightly wooden,"" and that he ""brought logic to a basically illogical story,"" acting as ""an intrusion"" to their otherwise complete anarchy.",4,25,== Legacy ==,177729
"Zeppo's comic persona was further highlighted in the ""dictation scene"" of Animal Crackers.",5,25,== Legacy ==,177729

There is a common assumption that Zeppo =,0,26,== Legacy ==,177729
"Zero, which this scene does its best to contradict.",1,26,== Legacy ==,177729
Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly be cause for rejoicing.,2,26,== Legacy ==,177729
We have to believe that someone will be there to accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash.,3,26,== Legacy ==,177729

"Groucho says, 'No, put it in the envelope.'",5,26,== Legacy ==,177729
Zeppo nods.,6,26,== Legacy ==,177729
And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn't sound important to him.,7,26,== Legacy ==,177729
It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.: 114,8,26,== Legacy ==,177729
"In the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo's position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in his analysis of Horse Feathers.",0,27,== Legacy ==,177729

Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy.,0,28,== Legacy ==,177729

"For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it's immortality.",3,28,== Legacy ==,177729
"Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy.",4,28,== Legacy ==,177729

"Zeppo’s onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho's aloof secretary in their films, but he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, plain-English rebuttals (see Animal Crackers) when Chico's snappy comebacks only fuel Groucho’s insults all the more.",0,30,== Legacy ==,177729
"… Zeppo's parts are usually small, but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to rattle.",1,30,== Legacy ==,177729

"As he ambles out of a scene, perhaps it is to watch them do their business, to come back in as necessary to move the film along, and again to join in the celebration of the finish.",3,32,== Legacy ==,177729
"Further, Zeppo is crucial to the absurdity of the Paramount films.",4,32,== Legacy ==,177729
The humor is in his incongruity.,5,32,== Legacy ==,177729
"Typically he dresses like a normal person, in stark contrast to Groucho's greasepaint and 'formal' attire, Harpo's rags, and Chico's immigrant hand-me-downs.",6,32,== Legacy ==,177729
"By most accounts, he is the handsomest of the brothers, yet that handsomeness is distorted by his familial resemblance to the others – sure, he's handsome, but it is a decidedly peculiar, Marxian handsomeness.",7,32,== Legacy ==,177729
"By making the group four, Zeppo adds symmetry, and in the surrealistic worlds of the Paramount films, this symmetry upsets rather than confirms balance: it is chaos born of symmetry.",8,32,== Legacy ==,177729
"That he is a plank in a maelstrom, along with the very concept of 'this guy' who is there for no real reason, who joins in and is accepted by these other three wildmen while the narrative offers no explanation, are wonderful in their pure absurdity.",9,32,== Legacy ==,177729

"To string things together in a seemingly purposeless way,' said Mark Twain, 'and to be seemingly unaware that they are absurd, is the mark of American humor.'",11,32,== Legacy ==,177729
