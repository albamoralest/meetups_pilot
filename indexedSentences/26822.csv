"Steve Reich took a simple melody, which he played on a melodica, then recorded it.",1,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"He then sets the melody to two separate channels, and slowly moves them out of phase, creating an intricate interlocking melody.",2,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"This piece is very similar to Come Out in rhythmic structure, and are an example of how one rhythmic process can be realized in different sounds to create two different pieces of music.",3,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"Reich was inspired to compose this piece from a dream he had on May 22, 1966, and put the piece together in one day.",4,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"Melodica was the last piece Reich composed solely for tape, and he considers it his transition from tape music to instrumental music.",5,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"Reich's first attempt at translating this phasing technique from recorded tape to live performance was the 1967 Piano Phase, for two pianos.",6,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"In Piano Phase the performers repeat a rapid twelve-note melodic figure, initially in unison.",7,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"As one player keeps tempo with robotic precision, the other speeds up very slightly until the two parts line up again, but one sixteenth note apart.",8,10,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822

"A similar, lesser known example of this so-called process music is Pendulum Music (1968), which consists of the sound of several microphones swinging over the loudspeakers to which they are attached, producing feedback as they do so.",0,11,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"""Pendulum Music"" has never been recorded by Reich himself, but was introduced to rock audiences by Sonic Youth in the late 1990s.",1,11,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"Reich also tried to create the phasing effect in a piece ""that would need no instrument beyond the human body"".",0,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
He found that the idea of phasing was inappropriate for the simple ways he was experimenting to make sound.,1,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"Instead, he composed Clapping Music (1972), in which the players do not phase in and out with each other, but instead one performer keeps one line of a 12-eighth-note-long (12-quaver-long) phrase and the other performer shifts by one eighth note beat every 12 bars, until both performers are back in unison 144 bars later.",2,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
The 1967 prototype piece Slow Motion Sound was not performed although Chris Hughes performed it 27 years later as Slow Motion Blackbird on his Reich-influenced 1994 album Shift.,3,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"It introduced the idea of slowing down a recorded sound until many times its original length without changing pitch or timbre, which Reich applied to Four Organs (1970), which deals specifically with augmentation.",4,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"The piece has maracas playing a fast eighth note pulse, while the four organs stress certain eighth notes using an 11th chord.",5,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
This work therefore dealt with repetition and subtle rhythmic change.,6,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"In contrast to Reich's typical cyclical structure, Four Organs is unique among his work in using a linear structure—the superficially similar Phase Patterns, also for four organs but without maracas, is (as the name suggests) a cyclical phase piece similar to others composed during the period.",7,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822
"Four Organs was performed as part of a Boston Symphony Orchestra program, and was Reich's first composition to be performed in a large traditional setting.",8,12,== Career == | === 1960s ===,26822

"From his African experience, as well as A. M. Jones's Studies in African Music about the music of the Ewe people, Reich drew inspiration for his 90-minute piece Drumming, which he composed shortly after his return.",2,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"Composed for a nine-piece percussion ensemble with female voices and piccolo, Drumming marked the beginning of a new stage in his career, for around this time he formed his ensemble, Steve Reich and Musicians, and increasingly concentrated on composition and performance with them.",3,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"Steve Reich and Musicians, which was to be the sole ensemble to interpret his works for many years, still remains active with many of its original members.",4,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"After Drumming, Reich moved on from the ""phase shifting"" technique that he had pioneered, and began writing more elaborate pieces.",5,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
He investigated other musical processes such as augmentation (the temporal lengthening of phrases and melodic fragments).,6,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"It was during this period that he wrote works such as Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices and Organ (1973) and Six Pianos (1973).",7,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"In 1974, Reich began writing Music for 18 Musicians.",0,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"This piece involved many new ideas, although it also hearkened back to earlier pieces.",1,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"It is based on a cycle of eleven chords introduced at the beginning (called ""Pulses""), followed by a small section of music based on each chord (""Sections I-XI""), and finally a return to the original cycle (""Pulses"").",2,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
This was Reich's first attempt at writing for larger ensembles.,3,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"The increased number of performers resulted in more scope for psychoacoustic effects, which fascinated Reich, and he noted that he would like to ""explore this idea further"".",4,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
Reich remarked that this one work contained more harmonic movement in the first five minutes than any other work he had written.,5,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
Steve Reich and Musicians made the premier recording of this work on ECM Records.,6,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
Reich explored these ideas further in his frequently recorded pieces Music for a Large Ensemble (1978) and Octet (1979).,0,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"In these two works, Reich experimented with ""the human breath as the measure of musical duration ...",1,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"the chords played by the trumpets are written to take one comfortable breath to perform"".",2,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
Human voices are part of the musical palette in Music for a Large Ensemble but the wordless vocal parts simply form part of the texture (as they do in Drumming).,3,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"With Octet and his first orchestral piece Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards (also 1979), Reich's music showed the influence of Biblical cantillation, which he had studied in Israel since the summer of 1977.",4,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"After this, the human voice singing a text would play an increasingly important role in Reich's music.",5,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
The technique ... consists of taking pre-existing melodic patterns and stringing them together to form a longer melody in the service of a holy text.,0,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"If you take away the text, you're left with the idea of putting together small motives to make longer melodies – a technique I had not encountered before.",1,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822
"In 1974 Reich published the book Writings About Music, containing essays on his philosophy, aesthetics, and musical projects written between 1963 and 1974.",0,18,== Career == | === 1970s ===,26822

Reich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage.,0,20,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
"Tehillim (1981), Hebrew for psalms, is the first of Reich's works to draw explicitly on his Jewish background.",1,20,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
"The work is in four parts, and is scored for an ensemble of four women's voices (one high soprano, two lyric sopranos and one alto), piccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, two clarinets, six percussion (playing small tuned tambourines without jingles, clapping, maracas, marimba, vibraphone and crotales), two electronic organs, two violins, viola, cello and double bass, with amplified voices, strings, and winds.",2,20,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
A setting of texts from Psalms 19:2–5,3,20,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
"(19:1–4 in Christian translations), 34:13–15 (34:12–14), 18:26–27 (18:25–26), and 150:4–6, Tehillim is a departure from Reich's other work in its formal structure; the setting of texts several lines long rather than the fragments used in previous works makes melody a substantive element.",4,20,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
Use of formal counterpoint and functional harmony also contrasts with the loosely structured minimalist works written previously.,5,20,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
"Different Trains (1988), for string quartet and tape, uses recorded speech, as in his earlier works, but this time as a melodic rather than a rhythmic element.",0,21,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
"In Different Trains, Reich compares and contrasts his childhood memories of his train journeys between New York and California in 1939–1941 with the very different trains being used to transport contemporaneous European children to their deaths under Nazi rule.",1,21,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
The Kronos Quartet recording of Different Trains was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 1990.,2,21,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822
"The composition was described by Richard Taruskin as ""the only adequate musical response—one of the few adequate artistic responses in any medium—to the Holocaust"", and he credited the piece with earning Reich a place among the great composers of the 20th century.",3,21,== Career == | === 1980s ===,26822

"The work, for percussion, voices, and strings, is a musical documentary, named for the Cave of Machpelah in Hebron, where a mosque now stands and Abraham is said to have been buried.",1,23,== Career == | === 1990s ===,26822
"Reich and Korot collaborated on the opera Three Tales, which concerns the Hindenburg disaster, the testing of nuclear weapons on Bikini Atoll, and other more modern concerns, specifically Dolly the sheep, cloning, and the technological singularity.",0,24,== Career == | === 1990s ===,26822
Reich used sampling techniques for pieces like Three Tales and City Life from 1994.,0,25,== Career == | === 1990s ===,26822
