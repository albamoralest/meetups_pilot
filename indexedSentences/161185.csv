"Other summaries of Clarkson's time as governor general, however, found that the increased travel abroad attracted negative attention to the viceregal post over costs and caused conflict between domestic duties and foreign obligations.",7,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"Also, it was observed that Clarkson had succumbed too easily to the desires of her advisors— both in the prime minister's and Privy Council offices, as well as amongst the staff of Government House— to turn the viceregal post into something it was not: Canada's head of state.",8,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"Clarkson had expressed admiration for the Queen, was said to understand ""the lustre the Crown affords,"" and to have ""shudder[ed] a little in sympathy with members of the Royal Family at the degree of intrusion into their lives they must bear.""",9,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"But the systematic downplaying of the monarch led to confusion over who was head of state and there was a sense that, by taking this view, Clarkson and her office were overturning the long-standing theory that all the viceroys and their respective jurisdictions are equal under a sovereign who reigns consistently over the whole country.",10,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"When Clarkson attended a provincial occasion, her protocol officers insisted that she take precedence over the pertinent lieutenant governor and denied knowledge of the established order in which the lieutenant governor, as a direct representative of the Queen in a province, takes precedence at a provincial function over all other attendees, save for the monarch.",11,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"These situations would result in ""precedence battles"", in which the provincial authorities would frequently acquiesce to pressure and ultimatums from Rideau Hall.",12,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"Clarkson also took the place of the monarch in presenting to the next vicereine the Chancellor's insignia of the Order of Canada, thereby breaking the order's ""first and oldest tradition""; a move Canada's expert on honours, Christopher McCreery, called ""a rather bizarre turn of events"".",13,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185
"The Monarchist League of Canada even reported that a member of parliament had telephoned to ask if they had ever before heard of the eruption of booing at the mention of the governor general's name, as had apparently happened in the MP's riding when Clarkson was spoken about.",14,27,== Governor General of Canada == | === Legacy ===,161185

She also signed a deal with Penguin Canada to publish her memoirs in two books.,1,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"The first, Heart Matters, was published in September 2006, making Clarkson the third former governor general to release an autobiography.",2,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"In the first half of the book, Clarkson outlined her childhood in Ottawa and her career in the CBC, while the second half covered her time as governor general, and contained her own positive views of Jean Chrétien and negative views of Paul Martin.",3,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"The book was met with mixed reviews, however, and her expressed opinion that future nominees for appointment as governor general should be voted on in the House of Commons was condemned by monarchists, though supported by Macleans.",4,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"During an October 2006 interview on CBC Newsworld with Don Newman, Clarkson spoke her views on the nature of the position of Governor General of Canada, stating that while the Queen remained popular with Canadians, the governor general was now the direct representative of ""the Crown"", and not of the monarch, therefore making the viceroy Canada's actual head of state.",5,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"This was a theory contrary to those of Eugene Forsey, the government of Canada itself, and numerous others, but was in line with Edward McWhinney.",6,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"Into 2009, Clarkson continued to promote this notion, stating at a constitutional law conference that the governor general embodied the nation and the prime minister's nominee for the viceregal role should thus be vetted by a parliamentary committee, in a similar format to Congressional Confirmation Hearings in the United States.",7,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
She then went further to say that the candidate should also submit to a televised quiz on Canadiana.,8,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"Though a University of Toronto political scientist stated this would ""strengthen the legitimacy of the governor-general as a non-partisan umpire,"" the editorial board of the Montreal Gazette said that the position being ""not elected is an asset, not a handicap"" and Clarkson's process would undermine the impartiality of the viceroy.",9,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
"Clarkson was on February 7, 2007, appointed by the Queen as Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, replacing the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, and commented that she was ""deeply honoured"" and proud to accept the role.",10,30,== Post-viceregal life ==,161185
