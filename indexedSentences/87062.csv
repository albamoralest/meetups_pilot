"Still a teenager, Cowell wrote the piano piece Dynamic Motion (1916), his first important work to explore the possibilities of the tone cluster (listen ).",4,4,== Life and career == | === Early life ===,87062

"It was on one of these tours that in 1923, his friend Richard Buhlig introduced Cowell to young pianist Grete Sultan in Berlin.",1,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062

Cowell later made such an impression with his tone cluster technique that Béla Bartók requested his permission to adopt it.,3,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062
"Another novel method advanced by Cowell, in pieces such as Aeolian Harp (ca. 1923), was what he dubbed ""string piano""—rather than using the keys to play, the pianist reaches inside the instrument and plucks, sweeps, and otherwise manipulates the strings directly.",4,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062
Cowell's endeavors with string piano techniques were the primary inspiration for John Cage's development of the prepared piano.,5,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062
"In early chamber music pieces, such as Quartet Romantic (1915–17) and Quartet Euphometric (1916–19 listen ), Cowell pioneered a compositional approach he called ""rhythm-harmony"": ""Both quartets are polyphonic, and each melodic strand has its own rhythm,"" he explained.",6,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062

"""Cowell's interest in harmonic rhythm, as discussed in New Musical Resources, led him in 1930 to commission Léon Theremin to invent the Rhythmicon, or Polyrhythmophone, a transposable keyboard instrument capable of playing notes in periodic rhythms proportional to the overtone series of a chosen fundamental pitch.",11,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062

"Soon, however, the Rhythmicon would be virtually forgotten, remaining so until the 1960s, when progressive pop music producer Joe Meek experimented with its rhythmic concept.",15,6,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062
"Cowell pursued a radical compositional approach through the mid-1930s, with solo piano pieces remaining at the heart of his output—important works from this era include The Banshee (1925), requiring numerous playing methods such as pizzicato and longitudinal sweeping and scraping of the strings (listen ), and the manic, cluster-filled Tiger (1930), inspired by William Blake's famous poem.",0,7,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062
"Much of Cowell's public reputation continued to be based on his trademark pianistic technique: a critic for the San Francisco News, writing in 1932, referred to Cowell's ""famous 'tone clusters,' probably the most startling and original contribution any American has yet contributed to the field of music.""",1,7,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062

"He built on his substantial oeuvre of chamber music, with pieces such as the Adagio for Cello and Thunder Stick (1924) that explored unusual instrumentation and others that were even more progressive: Six Casual Developments (1933), for clarinet and piano, sounds like something Jimmy Giuffre would compose thirty years later.",3,7,== Life and career == | === Musical pioneer ===,87062

"Cowell was the central figure in a circle of avant-garde composers that included his good friends Carl Ruggles and Dane Rudhyar, as well as Leo Ornstein, John Becker, Colin McPhee, French expatriate Edgard Varèse, and Ruth Crawford, whom he convinced Charles Seeger to take on as a student (Crawford and Seeger would eventually marry).",0,9,== Life and career == | === Ultra-modernist and world music leader ===,87062
"Cowell and his circle were sometimes referred to as ""ultra-modernists,"" a label whose definition is flexible and origin unclear (it has also been applied to a few composers outside the immediate circle, such as George Antheil, and to some of its disciples, such as Nancarrow); Virgil Thomson styled them the ""rhythmic research fellows.""",1,9,== Life and career == | === Ultra-modernist and world music leader ===,87062

"Major scores by Ives, including the Comedy from the Fourth Symphony, Fourth of July, 34 Songs, and 19 Songs, would receive their first publication in New Music; in turn, Ives would provide financial support to a number of Cowell's projects (including, years later, New Music itself).",5,9,== Life and career == | === Ultra-modernist and world music leader ===,87062

"The ultra-modernist movement had expanded its reach in 1928, when Cowell led a group that included Ruggles, Varèse, his fellow expatriate Carlos Salzedo, American composer Emerson Whithorne, and Mexican composer Carlos Chávez in founding the Pan-American Association of Composers, dedicated to promoting composers from around the Western Hemisphere and creating a community among them that would transcend national lines.",0,10,== Life and career == | === Ultra-modernist and world music leader ===,87062

"During this era, Cowell also spread the ultra-modernists' experimental creed as a highly regarded teacher of composition and theory—among his many students were George Gershwin, Lou Harrison, who said he thought of Cowell as ""the mentor of mentors,"" and John Cage, who proclaimed Cowell ""the open sesame for new music in America.",6,10,== Life and career == | === Ultra-modernist and world music leader ===,87062

"The twenty-four measures of the Larghetto and the eight of the Trio are each modular; though Cowell offers some suggestions, any hypothetically may be included or not and played once or repeatedly, allowing the piece to stretch or contract at the performers' will—the practical goal being to give a choreographer freedom to adjust the length and character of a dance piece without the usual constraints imposed by a prewritten musical composition.",10,12,== Life and career == | === Imprisonment ===,87062

"The experience took a lasting toll on his music: Cowell's compositional output became strikingly more conservative soon after his release from San Quentin, with simpler rhythms and a more traditional harmonic language.",2,14,== Life and career == | === Final years and death ===,87062
"Many of his later works are based on American folk music, such as the series of eighteen Hymn and Fuguing Tunes (1943–64); folk music had certainly played a role in a number of Cowell's prewar compositions, but the provocative transformations that had been his signature were now largely abandoned.",3,14,== Life and career == | === Final years and death ===,87062
