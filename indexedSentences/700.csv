"Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, On Vision and Colors, which in many points differed from his teacher's.",19,11,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
"Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements—and especially Schopenhauer's extreme self-confidence and tactless criticisms—soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.",20,11,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
"Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.",21,11,== Life == | === Early work ===,700

"Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the Upanishads (he called them ""the production of the highest human wisdom"", and believed that they contained superhuman concepts) and the Buddha, and put them on a par with Plato and Kant.",23,11,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
"He continued his studies by reading the Bhagavad Gita, an amateurish German journal Asiatisches Magazin and Asiatick Researches by the Asiatic Society.",24,11,== Life == | === Early work ===,700

"Schopenhauer read the Latin translation and praised the Upanishads in his main work, The World as Will and Representation (1819), as well as in his Parerga and Paralipomena (1851), and commented,In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads.",0,12,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
"It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death.",1,12,== Life == | === Early work ===,700

He corresponded regularly with his sister Adele and became close to her as her relationship with Johanna and Gerstenbergk also deteriorated.,12,13,== Life == | === Early work ===,700

"Arthur offered to share his assets, but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments.",14,13,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
"The women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while Arthur, using his business knowledge, took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full.",15,13,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
The affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of the Schopenhauer family.,16,13,== Life == | === Early work ===,700
He shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Muhl and returned to Dresden.,17,13,== Life == | === Early work ===,700

For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth.,2,121,== Thoughts on other philosophers == | === Immanuel Kant ===,700
"It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither Berkeley nor Malebranche succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light.",3,121,== Thoughts on other philosophers == | === Immanuel Kant ===,700

"Schopenhauer praised Kant for his distinction between appearance and the thing-in-itself, whereas the general consensus in German idealism was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory, since, according to Kant, causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances.",0,125,== Thoughts on other philosophers == | === Immanuel Kant ===,700

"Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed.",2,128,== Thoughts on other philosophers == | === Post-Kantian school ===,700

"Schopenhauer deemed Schelling the most talented of the three and wrote that he would recommend his ""elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant"" concerning the intelligible character, if he had been honest enough to admit he was parroting Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.",0,129,== Thoughts on other philosophers == | === Post-Kantian school ===,700
