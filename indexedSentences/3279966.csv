"Poole appreciated ""all musical ratios derived from the primes 3, 5, and 7"" and more tentatively, 11, and he also asserted the melodic beauty of microtonal commatic shifts.",0,7,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"He described a 7-limit double diatonic just scale to distinguish it from the usual diatonic scale, which he called the triple diatonic, with common tones from tonic, dominant and subdominant major triads.",1,7,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"The new scale replaced subdominant pitches with the ""perfect seventh and ninth of the dominant harmony"" to correspond better with what he heard harmonically and melodically in all kinds of music.",2,7,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"Poole proposed using five parallel chains of fifths from 1/1, 5/4, 25/16, 7/4 and 35/16, which he distinguished by type and case.",3,7,== Musical inventions ==,3279966

"The 1849 organ was described being capable of playing eleven musical (major) keys from the ordinary keyboard in pure intonation by furnishing multiple pipes for each physical key, with foot pedals operating intermediate levers inserted into the tracker works to switch between pairs of pallet valves furnished for each note.",0,14,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
The inventors described great benefits due to the tuning - they even claim it stayed in tune better - and argued how these balanced its greater size (up to 8 feet wider) and reduction in loudness compared with instruments of similar cost and number of pipes.,1,14,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"They estimated one having ""two Diapasons, the Trumpet, the Oboe, the Dulciana, the Flute and the Clarabella, in perfect tune"" to cost between $4000 and $5000, and one third more if a Great Organ was desired.",2,14,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"On the suggestion of Thomas Perronet Thompson Poole developed a special keyboard to compel a ""musician to know what he is doing"", although A. U. Hayter, the King's Chapel organist, had complained about the care required by the existing plan.",0,15,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
The new keyboard organized pitches in a similar fashion to an ordinary piano keyboard but also emphasized the different classes of pitches by using different shapes and colors of keytops.,1,15,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"The 1/1 series was assigned to large white natural keys arranged rising in diagonal rows, the 5/4 series on raised black sharp keys between the white keys, the 7/4 series on square red keys followed by square yellow 63/32 and blue 45/32 keys behind the white keys (a 6/5 series could be added using buttons raised above the sharp keys if desired).",2,15,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
Key motion was linear and used two guide pins.,3,15,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"The staggered keyboard arrangement separated distant key signatures and aligned octaves and was transpositionally invariant but not generalized, although the abbreviated pedalboard implied 3, 5, and 7 axes for 14 key-notes using three ranks of identical key levers.",4,15,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"Poole outlined methods to increase the versatility of similarly arranged instruments, including a slightly tempered 78-tone scale, and a 106-tone scale with two cycles of 53 equal temperament (a Bosanquet ""multiple system"").",0,16,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
"On April 6, 1871 an enharmonic reed organ constructed by Joseph Alley using more uniformly shaped keys was demonstrated at a meeting of the Society of Arts in Boston by Edward C. Pickering, and played by Edwin H. Higley.",0,17,== Musical inventions ==,3279966
