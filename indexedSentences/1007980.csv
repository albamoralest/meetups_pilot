"The monk's untitled work, referred to by modern scholars as De Carolo Magno (""Concerning Charles the Great"") or Gesta Caroli Magni (""The Deeds of Charles the Great""), is not a biography but consists instead of two books of anecdotes relating chiefly to the Emperor Charlemagne and his family, whose virtues are insistently invoked.",0,8,== The Monk of Saint Gall ==,1007980
"It was written for Charles the Fat, great-grandson of Charlemagne, who visited Saint Gall in 883.",1,8,== The Monk of Saint Gall ==,1007980
"It has been scorned by traditional historians, who refer to the Monk as one who ""took pleasure in amusing anecdotes and witty tales, but who was ill-informed about the true march of historical events"", and describe the work itself as a ""mass of legend, saga, invention and reckless blundering"": historical figures are claimed as living when in fact dead; claims are attributed to false sources (in one instance, the Monk claims that ""to this King Pepin [the Short] the learned Bede has devoted almost an entire book of his Ecclesiastical History""; no such account exists in Bede's history – unsurprisingly, given that Bede died in 735 during the reign of Charlemagne's grandfather Charles Martel); and Saint Gall is frequently referenced as a location in anecdotes, regardless of historical verisimilitude (Pepin the Hunchback, for example, is supposed to have been sent to Saint Gall as punishment for his rebellion, and – in a trope owed to Livy's tale of Tarquin and the poppies – earns a promotion to rich Prüm Abbey after advising Charlemagne through an implicit parable of hoeing thistles to execute another group of rebels).",2,8,== The Monk of Saint Gall ==,1007980

"The text is dated to the 880s from mentions in it of Carloman (died 880), half-brother of Charles the Fat, the ""circumscribed lands"" of Carloman's son Arnulf, who succeeded as King of the Germans in 887, and the destruction of Prüm Abbey, which occurred in 882.",6,8,== The Monk of Saint Gall ==,1007980
