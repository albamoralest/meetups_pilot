Much of Bly's prose writing focuses on what he saw as the particularly troubled situation in which many males find themselves today.,0,20,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704

"The ""Absence of the Father"" is a recurrent theme in Bly's work and according to him, many of the phenomena of depression, juvenile delinquency and lack of leadership in business and politics are linked to it.",5,20,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"Bly therefore saw today's men as half-adults, trapped between boyhood and maturity, in a state where they find it hard to become responsible in their work as well as leaders in their communities.",0,21,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
Eventually they might become weak or absent fathers themselves which will cause this behaviour to be passed down to their children.,1,21,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"In his book The Sibling Society (1997), Bly argues that a society formed of such men is inherently problematic as it lacks creativity and a deep sense of empathy.",2,21,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"The image of half-adults is further reinforced by popular culture which often portrays fathers as naive, overweight and almost always emotionally co-dependent.",3,21,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"Historically this represents a recent shift from a traditional patriarchal model and Bly believes that women rushed to fill the gap that was formed through the various youth movements during the 1960s, enhancing men's emotional capacities and helping them to connect with women's age-old pain of repression.",4,21,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704

"He researched and collected myths that concern male maturity, often originating from the Grimms' Fairy Tales and published them in various books, Iron John being the best known example.",1,22,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"In contrast to the continual pursuit of higher achievements, that is constantly taught to young men today, the theme of spiritual descent (often being referred to by its Greek term κατάβασις) which is to be found in many of these myths, is presented as a necessary step for coming in contact with the deeper aspects of the masculine self and achieving its full potential.",2,22,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"This is often presented as hero, often during the middle of his quest, going underground to pass a period of solitude and sorrow in semi-bestial mode.",3,22,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"Bly noticed that a cultural space existed in most traditional societies for such a period in a man's life, in the absence of which, many men today go into a depression and alcoholism as they subconsciously try to emulate this innate ritual.",4,22,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"Bly was influenced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung who developed the theory of archetypes, the discrete structures of the Psyche which emerge as images in dreams, myths, and art.",0,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"The Powerful King, the Evil Witch and the Beautiful Maiden are, according to Jung, some of the imprints of the collective unconscious and Bly wrote extensively about their meaning and relations to modern life.",1,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"As an example and in accordance with Jung, he considered the Witch to be that part of the male psyche upon which the negative and destructive side of a woman is imprinted and which first developed during infancy to store the imperfections of one's own mother.",2,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"As a consequence, the Witch's symbols are essentially inverted motherly symbols, where the loving act of cooking is transformed into the brewing of evil potions and knitting clothes takes the form of spider's web.",3,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"The feeding process is also reversed, with the child now in danger of being eaten to feed the body of the Witch rather than being fed by the mother's own body.",4,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"In that respect, the Witch is a mark of arrested development on the part of the man as it guards against feminine realities that his psyche is not yet able to incorporate fully.",5,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
"Fairy tales according to this interpretation mostly describe internal battles played out externally, where the hero saves his future bride by killing a witch, as in ""The Drummer"" (Grimms tale 193).",6,23,== Thought and the Men's Movement ==,307704
