"After sharing the Covent Garden stage in a 1923 night of operatic extracts with another Australian soprano, Florence Austral (who, as a dramatic soprano, posed no threat to Melba, a lyric soprano), Melba was effusive with her praise, describing the younger woman as ""one of the wonder-voices of the world"".",3,18,== Teacher and patron ==,254627

"Melba's first recordings were made around 1895, recorded on cylinders at the Bettini Phonograph Lab in New York.",0,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"A reporter from Phonoscope magazine was impressed: ""The next cylinder was labelled 'Melba' and was truly wonderful, the phonograph reproducing her wonderful voice in a marvellous manner, especially the high notes which soared away above the staff and were rich and clear.""",1,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Melba was less impressed: ""'Never again,' I said to myself as I listened to the scratching, screeching result.",2,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"'Don't tell me I sing like that, or I shall go away and live on a desert island.'""",3,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"The recordings never reached the general public – destroyed on Melba's orders, it is suspected – and Melba would not venture into a recording studio for another eight years.",4,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Melba can be heard singing on several Mapleson Cylinders, early attempts at live recording, made by the Metropolitan Opera House librarian Lionel Mapleson in the auditorium there during performances.",5,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"These cylinders are often poor in quality, but they preserve something of the quality of the young Melba's voice and performance that is sometimes lacking from her commercial recordings.",6,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
Melba made numerous gramophone (phonograph) records of her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was already in her 40s) and 1926 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company and the Victor Talking Machine Company.,7,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD.",8,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects the limitations of the early days of commercial sound recording.,9,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Melba's acoustical recordings (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving it without the body and warmth it possessed – albeit to a limited degree – in life.",10,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure lyric soprano voice with effortless coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation.",11,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall says of her complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set.",12,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba's exceptional purity of tone was probably one of the principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her.",13,20,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"Melba's farewell to Covent Garden on 8 June 1926 was recorded by HMV, as well as broadcast.",0,21,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"The programme included Act 2 of Roméo et Juliette (not recorded because the tenor Charles Hackett was not under contract to HMV), followed by the opening of Act 4 of Otello (Desdemona's ""Willow Song"" and ""Ave Maria"") and Acts 3 and 4 of La bohème (with Aurora Rettore, Browning Mummery, John Brownlee and others).",1,21,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627

"In a pioneering venture, eleven sides (78rpm) were recorded via a landline to Gloucester House (London), though in the event only three of these were published.",4,21,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
The full series (including both speeches) was included in a 1976 HMV reissue.,5,21,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"As was the case in many of her performances, most of Melba's recordings were made at ""French Pitch"" (A=435 Hz), rather than the British early 20th century standard of A=452 Hz, or the modern standard of A=440 Hz.",6,21,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"This, and the technical inadequacies of the early recording process (discs were frequently recorded faster or slower than the supposed standard of 78rpm, whilst the conditions of the cramped recording studios – kept very warm to keep the wax at the necessary softness when cutting – would wreak havoc with instrumental tuning during recording sessions), means that playing her recordings back in the speed and pitch she made them at is not always a simple matter.",7,21,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
"On 15 June 1920, Melba was heard in a pioneering radio broadcast from Guglielmo Marconi's New Street Works factory in Chelmsford, singing two arias and her famous trill.",0,22,== Recordings and broadcasts ==,254627
