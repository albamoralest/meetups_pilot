"It was Samuel (as Jeremy later repeatedly acknowledged) who conceived the basic idea of a circular building at the hub of a larger compound as a means of allowing a small number of managers to oversee the activities of a large and unskilled workforce.Bentham began to develop this model, particularly as applicable to prisons, and outlined his ideas in a series of letters sent home to his father in England.",1,7,== Biography == | === Abortive prison project and the Panopticon ===,46038

"Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of Joseph Priestley, although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form ""the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing [sic] relating to that state must finally be determined.",3,23,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038

"They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think.…",3,26,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
Bentham's Principles of Morals and Legislation focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices.,0,27,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
His principle of utility regards good as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and evil as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure.,1,27,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual.,2,27,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
"Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society.In order to measure the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create, he lays down a set of criteria divided into the categories of intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and extent.",3,27,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
"Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society.",4,27,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence.,0,28,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
"Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number.",1,28,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
"He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared ""right"", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole.",2,28,== Work == | === Utilitarianism ===,46038
