"Ned Sublette says, ""In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record.",2,45,== Beat ==,5033
"A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets.""",3,45,== Beat ==,5033
"The Bo Diddley beat is similar to ""hambone"", a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes.",4,45,== Beat ==,5033
"Somewhat resembling the ""shave and a haircut, two bits"" rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play Gene Autry's ""(I've Got Spurs That) Jingle, Jangle, Jingle"".",5,45,== Beat ==,5033

"Many songs (for example, ""Hey Bo Diddley"" and ""Who Do You Love?"") often have no chord changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic tension and release.",0,47,== Beat ==,5033

"In one of the most well-known of his 1958 doo-wop sessions, Diddley added harmonies by the Carnations recording as the Teardrops, who sang smooth, polished doo-wop in the backgrounds on the songs ""I'm Sorry"", ""Crackin' Up"", and ""Don't Let it Go"".",4,47,== Beat ==,5033

"In a 2005 interview on JJJ radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment.",8,47,== Beat ==,5033
"During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a Gibson L5 guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin.",9,47,== Beat ==,5033
