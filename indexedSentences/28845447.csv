"William E. Caplin (born 1948) is an American music theorist who lives and works in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he is a James McGill Professor at the Schulich School of Music of McGill University.",0,0,N/A,28845447
Caplin served as president of the Society for Music Theory from 2005 to 2007 and was its vice-president from 2001 to 2003.,1,0,N/A,28845447
"His earlier work concentrated on the history of music theory, but he is best known for a series of articles and two books on musical form in European music around 1800.",2,0,N/A,28845447
"The first of those books, Classical Form: A Theory of Formal Functions for the Music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven has been widely influential and was a major factor in the revival of interest in musical form in North-American music theory.",3,0,N/A,28845447

"Classical Form, along with a more recently published, lengthy textbook intended for both undergraduate and graduate levels, expounds a theory and analytical method for the music of the ""high Classical"" era (roughly, the two decades before and after 1800).",0,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
The theory is grounded in eighteenth-century compositional pedagogy and in work by Arnold Schoenberg and his pupil Erwin Ratz.,1,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"Broadly, the theory can be understood as ""a generalized taxonomy of Classical form gleaned from a large repertory of works rather than the description of the organic wholeness or the uniqueness of events in any one work.",2,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"""Schoenberg’s concept of the “basic idea” (here understood as a two-measure unit) and his distinction between period and sentence—two models for themes—are the foundation for a theory based on a dichotomy between “tight-knit” and “loose” designs and on “beginning,” “middle,” “end” functions.",3,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The core figure is the theme (understood paradigmatically as eight bars in length), but formal functions can be extended outward to form sections and entire movements.",4,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"“Tight-knit"" themes and small forms are the sentence, period, hybrid and compound (16-bar) themes, small ternary, and small binary.",5,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"“Looser formal regions” are the subordinate theme, transition, development, recapitulation, and coda.",6,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
The period is the symmetrical or balanced design familiar from traditional form theory: an antecedent phrase with two contrasting ideas is followed by a consequent phrase that repeats (or slightly varies) the initial two-bar idea and adds a cadential idea to close.,7,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The sentence is a progressive or developmental design, where a presentation phrase consists of an idea and its repetition (often varied or transposed) followed by a continuation phrase that, ideally, fragments the initial idea by breaking it into one-bar motives and thereby accelerating movement toward the cadence.",8,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The less common hybrid themes mix the components in variously different ways (for example, the antecedent + continuation theme).",9,2,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447

"Hybrid 4: compound basic idea + consequentFor hybrid 2: ""cadential"" refers to a phrase where a typical progression in a cadence (usually just two bars) is stretched over the entire phrase.",0,9,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"Often this function is filled by the Expanded Cadential Progression (ECP) or I6-ii6-V-I. For hybrids 3 and 4: the compound basic idea is itself a hybrid: it has the antecedent's basic idea & contrasting idea pair, but it has the presentation's (usually) simple tonic prolongation.",1,9,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"From these examples it can be seen that harmony has a powerful, often determining, role in Caplin's theory.",2,9,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"Compound themes are of two types: the sixteen-measure period, which is the same as the traditional double period, and the sixteen-measure sentence.",0,10,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The sixteen-measure period opens with an antecedent consisting of any eight-bar theme, which ends with a half cadence (HC) rather than a perfect authentic cadence (PAC).",1,10,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
The eight-bar consequent repeats the opening but adjusts the cadence to a PAC.,2,10,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The sixteen-measure sentence is paradigmatically an eight-bar presentation, consisting of a compound basic idea and its repetition, followed by an eight-bar continuation with the typical features of fragmentation and sequence.",3,10,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"In larger contexts in Classical-era music, passages of tight-knit and loose-knit functions tend to alternate, the tight-knit units being represented by the themes above, the loose knit units by isolated phrases, model-sequence groups, ""standing on the dominant,"" and other entities.",0,11,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"Pragmatically,  the “strict definition of formal categories [is] applied with ‘considerable flexibility’ in analysis.”",0,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"Thus, data for a set of analyses could be read as objective information but could just as easily be taken as a catalogue of the analyst’s choices.",1,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
The assignment of labels for thematic elements often involves a judgment call.,2,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The form-function theory, in other words, is both taxonomic and interpretative; it is from balancing the two that one can learn the most about the repertoires under analysis.",3,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"The theory has, nevertheless, been criticized for a ""zeal for exhaustive theoretical and terminological rigor"" that can interfere with that flexibility in analysis, and specifically for its ""dogged adherence to a rigidly quadratic conception of grouping structures""; that is, to ideas defined as two bars and themes defined as eight bars.",4,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"A related criticism is Caplin's ""tendency to substitute [a formal/functional] archetype for the music in question as the point of reference for analytical discussion.",5,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
"""Although intended for, and derived specifically from, the music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, the theory of formal functions has been extended by various authors, mostly to later repertoires and largely in connection with the sentence paradigm (notably, Schubert, Schumann, Wagner, Schoenberg, and music in film) but occasionally earlier as well (especially J.S. Bach).",6,12,== Theory of Formal Functions ==,28845447
