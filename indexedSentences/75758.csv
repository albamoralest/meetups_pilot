"In March and April 1971 – the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, Grateful Dead – Garcia played the ""Peanut,"" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early '60s Les Paul.",6,43,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by Graham Nash.",0,44,== Musical equipment ==,75758
Garcia added an alligator sticker to the pickguard in the fall of that year.,1,44,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"""Alligator"" would remain Garcia's principal electric guitar until August 1973.",2,44,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"In the summer of 1971, Garcia also played a double-cutaway Les Paul TV Junior.",0,45,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"While Alligator was in the shop in the summer of 1972, he briefly reverted to the sunburst Stratocaster; this can be seen in Sunshine Daydream.",0,46,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"In late 1972, Garcia purchased the first guitar (""Eagle"") made by Alembic luthier Doug Irwin for $850 (equivalent to $5,300 in 2020).",0,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument.",1,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"This guitar, nicknamed ""Wolf"" for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September.",2,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"It cost $1,500 (equivalent to $8,700 in 2020), an extremely high price for the era.",3,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Wolf was made with an ebony fingerboard and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the headstock, ivory inlays, and fret marker dots made of sterling silver.",4,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of purpleheart.,5,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo.",6,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly single coils, while the other accommodated humbuckers.",7,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: ""Don't hold back.",8,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"""During the Grateful Dead's 1974 European tour, Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock.",9,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Following filming of The Grateful Dead Movie (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs.",10,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several Travis Bean guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977).",11,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia.",12,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would ""see"" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable.",13,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin).",14,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Nearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar (""Tiger"") from Irwin in the summer of 1979.",15,47,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the Oakland Auditorium Arena on August 4, 1979.",0,48,== Musical equipment ==,75758
Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover.,1,48,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was cocobolo, with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and flame maple, in that order.",0,49,== Musical equipment ==,75758
The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard.,1,49,== Musical equipment ==,75758
The pickups consisted of a single coil DiMarzio SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two.,2,49,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar.",3,49,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed 13+1⁄2 pounds (6.1 kg).",4,49,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played.",5,49,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"In the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars.",0,50,== Musical equipment ==,75758
There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck.,1,50,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the ""tree of life"" model.",2,50,== Musical equipment ==,75758
This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese luthier Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael.,3,50,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors.",4,50,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"In 1990, Irwin completed ""Rosebud"", Garcia's fourth custom guitar.",0,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight.",1,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own.",2,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar.,3,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer.,4,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the MIDI effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording Without a Net.,5,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to 11+1⁄2 pounds (5.2 kg).,6,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758

"In 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia.",9,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as ""Lightning Bolt"", again named for its inlay.",10,51,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers.",0,52,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively.",1,52,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar.",2,52,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to ""wing it.",3,52,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"""Cripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name ""Top Hat"".",4,52,== Musical equipment ==,75758
"Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold.",5,52,== Musical equipment ==,75758

"In 2001, Irwin won the case.",1,54,== Musical equipment ==,75758
