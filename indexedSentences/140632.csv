"Initially, Wilfred Jackson utilised a Metronome to set a definitive tempo of the cartoon sections, that then got further developed by the years.",3,5,== Biography ==,140632
"(Also known as a ""bar-sheet"" or a ""dope-sheet"").",4,5,== Biography ==,140632

An early example of a click track was used in the production of The Skeleton Dance (1929).,6,5,== Biography ==,140632
The method used in this film involved a reel of unexposed film with holes punched out to make clicks and pops when run on the sound head.,7,5,== Biography ==,140632
"According to Strauss, this version of the click track is credited to sound effects artist Jimmy MacDonald.Stalling left Disney after two years, at the same time as animator Ub Iwerks.",8,5,== Biography ==,140632

"Finding few outlets in New York, Stalling rejoined Iwerks at his studio in California, while freelancing for Disney and others.",10,5,== Biography ==,140632
Stalling served as the music director of Iwerks' studio until the studio shut down in 1936.,11,5,== Biography ==,140632
"In 1936, when Leon Schlesinger—under contract to produce animated shorts for Warner Bros.—hired Iwerks, Stalling went with him to become a full-time cartoon music composer.",12,5,== Biography ==,140632
"According to Sigall, Stalling was hired by the Leon Schlesinger studio in July, 1936.",13,5,== Biography ==,140632
She recalled the month because she was hired by the studio as an apprentice painter that same month.,14,5,== Biography ==,140632
Stalling already had a reputation as a very talented musician and composer.,15,5,== Biography ==,140632
He had gained this reputation and considerable experience as the music director at the studios of both Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks.,16,5,== Biography ==,140632
Schlesinger was aware of these facts when offering to hire him.,17,5,== Biography ==,140632
Stalling had been recommended to Schlesinger by storyman Ben Hardaway.,18,5,== Biography ==,140632
"Hardaway had met Stalling while they both worked at the Iwerks studio and, when Schlesinger started searching for a new music director for his studio, Hardaway suggested hiring his old colleague who was available.",19,5,== Biography ==,140632
"According to Sigall, the hiring of Stalling turned out to be a smart move for Schlesinger.",20,5,== Biography ==,140632

"Brown, or Norman Spencer.",23,5,== Biography ==,140632
"From 1936 onwards, Stalling was the film score composer for almost every theatrical animated short released by Warner Bros. Cartoons until his retirement.",24,5,== Biography ==,140632
"Stalling served as the music director for this studio for 22 years and is credited for the film score of over 600 animated films.Like his predecessors as music director for the studio, Stalling had full access to the expansive Warner Bros. catalog and musicians.",25,5,== Biography ==,140632
"He could also use the fifty-piece orchestra of the company, headed at the time by Leo F. Forbstein.",26,5,== Biography ==,140632
The executives at Warner Bros. in fact insisted that Stalling should use as much music and songs from their feature films as possible.,27,5,== Biography ==,140632
"Their dual goal was to help promote the animated shorts by associating them with already popular music, and to help promote the songs themselves by giving them additional publicity.",28,5,== Biography ==,140632
They hoped that such cross promotion would increase the sales of the songs.Stalling remained with Warner Bros. until he retired in 1958.,29,5,== Biography ==,140632
"His last cartoon was To Itch His Own, directed by Chuck Jones.",30,5,== Biography ==,140632

Stalling and Franklyn had shared credits for musical direction during the last years of Stalling's tenure.,32,5,== Biography ==,140632
"There was not much of a transition phase when Franklyn took over the position, as their styles were, for the most part, similar (although Franklyn would experiment with more popular styles of music as rock and roll rose to prominence and the animation styles themselves evolved into more modernist approaches).",33,5,== Biography ==,140632
Franklyn died suddenly in 1962 and was replaced by William Lava for the remainder of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies' theatrical runs.,34,5,== Biography ==,140632
"Lava's work borrowed from styles such as world music and used a much smaller, more stripped down (and less expensive) orchestra that gave his orchestrations a much different feel to those Stalling and his protégé Franklyn had composed.",35,5,== Biography ==,140632
== Composing style ==,0,6,== Composing style ==,140632
"Although Stalling's composing technique followed the conventions of music accompaniment from the silent film era that were based on improvisation and compilation of musical cues from  catalogs and cue-sheets, he was also an innovator.",0,7,== Composing style ==,140632
Stalling is among the first music directors to extensively use the metronome to time film scores.,1,7,== Composing style ==,140632
"He was one of three composers, along with Max Steiner and Scott Bradley, credited with the invention of the click track.",2,7,== Composing style ==,140632
"His stock-in-trade was the ""musical pun"", where he used references to popular songs, or even classical pieces, to add a dimension of humor to the action on the screen.",0,8,== Composing style ==,140632
"Working with directors Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Robert McKimson and Chuck Jones, he developed the Looney Tunes style of very rapid and tightly coordinated musical cues, punctuated with both instrumental and recorded sound effects, and occasionally reaching into full blown musical fantasies such as The Rabbit of Seville and A Corny Concerto.",1,8,== Composing style ==,140632
Stalling's working process involved meeting each animated short film's director or directors before the animation process began.,0,9,== Composing style ==,140632
Together they set the time signatures to which the short was to be drawn.,1,9,== Composing style ==,140632
The animators of the film were measuring animation frames per beat.,2,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"After the animation process was completed, Stalling would receive the animators' exposure sheets or bar sheets.",3,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"The sheets broke the animation, dialogue, and sound effects into musical bars, which Stalling would then use to create his score for the film.When working on a film score, Stalling would incorporate his musical puns.",4,9,== Composing style ==,140632
He chose popular songs whose titles fit the on-screen gags.,5,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"His music quotations were often brief, sometimes not lasting more than four seconds.",6,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"John Zorn has described Stalling's sense for quotation as ""Ivesian"", in reference to composer Charles Ives and his innovative musical quotation techniques.",7,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"His musical cues, the unedited periods between the commencement and end of a single musical take, had varying lengths.",8,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"At the short end of the spectrum, they would last no more than two seconds.",9,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"At the long end, they would last two minutes.",10,9,== Composing style ==,140632
Stalling would often use music quotations from the themes of the live-action films of the Warner Bros.' studio.Most of his film scores involved 500 measures in ten sections.,11,9,== Composing style ==,140632
His compositions were performed by Warner Brothers' fifty-piece orchestra.,12,9,== Composing style ==,140632
Neil Strauss notes that this orchestra was often employed for relatively undemanding film scores for live-action feature films.,13,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"When working for Stalling, the orchestra would find itself burdened with more challenging and taxing work.",14,9,== Composing style ==,140632
Stalling recorded many variations of the opening themes of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series.,15,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"The theme of the Looney Tunes series was ""The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down"" (1937), a minor hit from the team of Dave Franklin and Cliff Friend.",16,9,== Composing style ==,140632
Franklin and Friend were members of the Tin Pan Alley.,17,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"The theme of the Merrie Melodies series was ""Merrily We Roll Along"" (1935).",18,9,== Composing style ==,140632
An electric guitar provided the song's initial sound effect.Stalling was a master at quickly changing musical styles based on the action in the cartoon.,19,9,== Composing style ==,140632
His arrangements were complicated and technically demanding.,20,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"The music itself served both as a background for the cartoon, and provided musical sound effects.",21,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"The titles of the music often described the action, sometimes forming jokes for those familiar with the tunes.",22,9,== Composing style ==,140632
"Stalling made extensive use of the many works of Raymond Scott, whose music was licensed by Warner Bros. in the early 1940s.",0,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"According to Strauss, Stalling relied heavily on the music Scott composed during the 1930s.",1,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"For example, the reportedly ""fast and wacky"" ""Powerhouse"" (1937) by Scott was frequently used to accompany animated scenes involving conveyor-belts or chases.",2,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"Scott's works had a cartoon sensibility and brought visual images to mind, elements which Stalling needed for his compositions.",3,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"Due to Stalling's frequent use of his works, Raymond Scott was eventually considered a ""cartoon composer"" in his own right.",4,10,== Composing style ==,140632
But Scott did not actually compose his works with the intention of using them as film scores.Stalling's cues are always tied to the story on the screen.,5,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"For example, he often used ""The Lady in Red"" and ""Oh, You Beautiful Doll"" in scenes with attractive women or characters in female drag, and ""California, Here I Come"" for scenes where characters make hasty departures.",6,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"Scenes involving automobiles were often accompanied by ""In My Merry Oldsmobile"".",7,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"Raymond Scott's ""In an 18th Century Drawing Room"" is usually associated with Granny in the Sylvester and Tweety shorts, and his ""Powerhouse"" pops up in scenes of machines, factories or mechanical devices.",8,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"Stalling composed music for the Rossini-derived short The Rabbit of Seville, and linked Smetana's ""The Dance of the Comedians"" to Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.",9,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"Stalling is remembered today for the scores of cartoons that remain popular, and are often remembered for their music.",10,10,== Composing style ==,140632
"His melodies are heard through most of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons, and imitated in new Looney Tunes compilations and features such as Looney Tunes: Back in Action.",11,10,== Composing style ==,140632
Film critic Leonard Maltin pointed out that listening to the soundtracks of the Warner cartoons was an important part of his musical education; the use of the full Warner Bros. Orchestra resulted in a richness of sound that is often lacking in more modern cartoons.,0,11,== Composing style ==,140632
Allan Neuwirth considers Stalling's work style in the Warner Bros. films to be highly recognizable.,0,12,== Composing style ==,140632
"It consisted of ""lush orchestrations"", sampling of popular songs, and ""hair-trigger shifts in pacing"".",1,12,== Composing style ==,140632
"The pacing of the film score could quickly change from manic and furious to slow and gentle, and back again.",2,12,== Composing style ==,140632
Stalling's music would match the mood required for any given scene.,3,12,== Composing style ==,140632
Neuwirth argues that the music managed to enhance the mood set by these scenes.,4,12,== Composing style ==,140632
This was what made Stalling's work so effective.,5,12,== Composing style ==,140632
== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,0,13,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
Chuck Jones and the other Looney Tunes directors sometimes complained about Stalling's proclivity for musical quotation and punning.,0,14,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"In an interview, Jones complained:",1,14,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
He was a brilliant musician.,0,15,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
But the quickest way for him to write a musical score was to simply look up some music that had the proper name.,1,15,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"If there was a lady dressed in red, he'd always play ""The Lady in Red"".",2,15,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"If somebody went into a cave, he'd play ""Fingal's Cave"".",3,15,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"If we were doing anything about eating, he'd do ""A Cup of Coffee, a Sandwich and You"".",4,15,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"I had a bee one time, and my God, if he didn't go and find a piece of music written in 1906 or something called ""I'm a Busy Little Bumble Bee"".",5,15,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
Musicologist and animation historian Daniel Goldmark has noted that Jones repeated this anecdote about Stalling in a number of interviews.,0,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"Jones also claimed in a 1975 interview that ""My Funny Little Bumble Bee"" song was too obscure for the audience to notice the musical reference.",1,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
He exaggerated that one had to be 108-years-old to even remember the existence of the song.,2,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
Goldmark believes that the anecdote itself was inaccurate in several ways.,3,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"The ""Bumble Bee song"" of the anecdote was actually ""Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee"" (1912), which was not obscure to begin with.",4,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"It was a hit song from the musical A Winsome Widow, produced by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr..",5,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
It had also been recorded to great acclaim by the popular duo of Ada Jones and Billy Murray.,6,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
And Stalling actually used this song only once during his entire tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons.,7,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"The song served as the title music of The Bee-Deviled Bruin (1949), an animated short directed by Chuck Jones.",8,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"Goldmark has also noted that Jones' claim about the repeated use of ""Fingal's Cave"" in cave scenes was inaccurate.",9,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
"Stalling did use the melody composed by Felix Mendelssohn in several animated shorts, but never in combination with an actual cave scene.",10,16,== Comments by Chuck Jones ==,140632
