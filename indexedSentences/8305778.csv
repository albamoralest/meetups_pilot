"Since the early 80s, she has investigated the microvariability of the sound and she dedicated her instrumental composition to microtonal tuned instruments (pianos, microtonal guitares, strings tuned in 1/4, 1/8, 1/12, 1/16 tone) which it is most of the time associated with diatonic instruments as well as to the Audio synthesis",0,5,== Composition ==,8305778
