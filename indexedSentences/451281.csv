Bocelli is a widely popular singer with a substantial fan base worldwide.,0,57,== Voice ==,451281
"However, he is also a polarizing figure in classical music, whose voice and performances",1,57,== Voice ==,451281
have routinely been the subject of negative reviews by critics.,0,58,== Voice ==,451281
"Italian spinto tenor Franco Corelli praised Bocelli's voice after hearing it for the first time during a master class in 1986, in Turin, and he later gave Bocelli private lessons.",1,58,== Voice ==,451281
"Puerto Rican soprano Ana María Martínez, who regularly performs with Bocelli, said, ""More than anything, Andrea has something that is unique in that he brings this light that is always around him.",2,58,== Voice ==,451281
And this purity of heart and beauty of sound just touches the listener.,3,58,== Voice ==,451281

"""Celine Dion said while introducing him during her Christmas Special for These Are Special Times, in 1998, that ""if God would have a singing voice, he must sound a lot like Andrea Bocelli,"" and David Foster, a producer of the album, often describes Bocelli's voice as the most beautiful in the world.",5,58,== Voice ==,451281
"Similarly, jazz singer Al Jarreau, who performed with Bocelli on the ""Night of the Proms"" tour in Europe in 1995, described him as ""the most beautiful voice in the world,"" and American talk show host Oprah Winfrey commented on her talk show that, ""when I hear Andrea sing, I burst into tears.""",6,58,== Voice ==,451281
"After attending Bocelli's concert at the Hollywood Bowl in 2009, British-American actress Elizabeth Taylor said, ""My mind, my soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being.",7,58,== Voice ==,451281

These include Bernard Holland of The New York Times and Andrew Clements of The Guardian.,12,58,== Voice ==,451281
"In 1999, The New York Times chief music critic Anthony Tommasini in his review of Bocelli's North American opera debut at the Detroit Opera House in the title role of Massenet's Werther commented, ""The basic colour of Mr. Bocelli's voice is warm and pleasant, but he lacks the technique to support and project his sound.",13,58,== Voice ==,451281
His sustained notes wobble.,14,58,== Voice ==,451281

"Inadequate breath control often forces him to clip off notes prematurely at the end of phrases.""",16,58,== Voice ==,451281
"In December 2000, Tommasini again criticised Bocelli, this time for his La bohème album when he stated that Bocelli ""still has trouble with basic things, like breath support"" and his voice had been ""carefully recorded ... to help it match the trained voices of the other cast members in fullness and presence.",17,58,== Voice ==,451281
"""In describing Bocelli's singing, The New York Times music critic Bernard Holland noted, ""the tone is rasping, thin and, in general, poorly supported.",18,58,== Voice ==,451281
"Even the most modest upward movement thins it even more, signalling what appears to be the onset of strangulation.",19,58,== Voice ==,451281
"To his credit, Mr Bocelli sings mostly in tune.",20,58,== Voice ==,451281
But his phrasing tends toward carelessness and rhythmic jumble...,21,58,== Voice ==,451281
"The diction is not clear.""",22,58,== Voice ==,451281

"Bocelli's voice – though robust in spirit and precisely in tune, even in the upper register – had a thin quality that never opened up.""",28,58,== Voice ==,451281
"Similarly, classical music critic Andrew Clements found Bocelli's studio opera recordings consistently disappointing in quality: ""Bocelli's profoundly unmusical contribution, with its unvaryingly coarse tone, wayward intonation and never a phrase properly shaped, fatally undermines all their contributions.""",29,58,== Voice ==,451281
"Anne Midgette of The New York Times agreed, noting ""a thinness of voice, oddly anemic phrasing (including shortchanging upper notes of phrases in a most untenorial manner), a curious lack of expression.",30,58,== Voice ==,451281
"""During a 2009 performance in New York, the music critic Steve Smith wrote ""For cognoscenti of vocal artistry the risks involved in Mr. Bocelli's undertakings, both then and now, need no explanation.",31,58,== Voice ==,451281

"""In 2010, Joe Banno of The Washington Post gave an unfavorable review of Bocelli's Carmen recording, describing the oft-noted failings in Bocelli's vocal resources on full display in this performance: ""Bocelli, to be fair, possesses an essentially lovely tenor and knows his stuff when it comes to selling a pop ballad.",35,58,== Voice ==,451281
