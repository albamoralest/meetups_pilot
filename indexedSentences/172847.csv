"King Tubby's first interaction with the music industry came in the late 1950s with the rising popularity of Jamaican sound systems, which were to be found all over Kingston and which were developing into enterprising businesses.",0,2,== Career ==,172847
"As a talented radio repairman, Tubby soon found himself in great demand by most of the major sound systems of Kingston, as the tropical weather of the Caribbean island (often combined with sabotage by rival sound system owners) led to malfunctions and equipment failure.",1,2,== Career ==,172847

"Before the advent of dub, most Jamaican 45s featured an instrumental version of the main song on the flipside, which was called the ""version"".",2,4,== Career == | === Remixes ===,172847
"When Tubby was asked to produce versions of songs for sound system MCs or toasters, Tubby initially worked to remove the vocal tracks with the faders on Reid's mixing desk, but soon discovered that the various instrumental tracks could be accentuated, reworked and emphasised through the settings on the mixer and early effects units.",3,4,== Career == | === Remixes ===,172847
"In time, Tubby began to create wholly new pieces of music by shifting the emphasis in the instrumentals, adding sounds and removing others and adding various special effects, like extreme delays, echoes, reverb and phase effects.",4,4,== Career == | === Remixes ===,172847

"Tubby built on his considerable knowledge of electronics to repair, adapt and design his own studio equipment, which made use of a combination of old devices and new technologies to produce a studio capable of the precise, atmospheric sounds which would become Tubby's trademark.",1,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"With a variety of effects units connected to his mixer, Tubby ""played"" the mixing desk like an instrument, bringing instruments and vocals in and out of the mix to create an entirely new genre known as dub music.",2,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"By the end of 1971 he was already providing dub mixes for producers such as Glen Brown and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry.",3,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"Using existing multitrack master tapes—his small studio in fact had no capacity to record session musicians—Tubby re-taped or ""dub"" the original after passing it through his 12-channel, custom-built MCI mixing desk, twisting the songs into unexpected configurations which highlighted the heavy rhythms of their bass and drum parts with minute snatches of vocals, horns, piano and organ.",4,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"These techniques mirrored the actions of the sound system selectors (reggae disc jockeys), who had long used EQ equipment to emphasise certain aspects of particular records, but Tubby used his custom-built studio to take this technique into new areas, often transforming a hit song to the point where it was almost unrecognisable from the original version.",5,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
One unique aspect of his remixes or dubs was the result of creative manipulating of the built-in high-pass filter on the MCI mixer he had bought from Dynamic Studios.,6,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"The filter was a parametric EQ which was controllable by a large knob—aka the ""big knob"" – which allowed Tubby to introduce a dramatic narrowing sweep of any signal, such as the horns, until the sound disappeared into a thin squeal.",7,6,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847

"In 1973, he added a second 4-track mixer, and built a vocal booth at his studio so he could record vocal tracks onto the instrumental tapes brought to him by various producers.",1,7,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847

"His name is credited on hundreds of B-side labels, with the possibility that many others were by his hand yet uncredited, due to similarities with his known work.",4,7,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"Several albums of Tubby's dub mixes were released, among the earliest the Perry-produced Blackboard Jungle and Bunny Lee's Dub from the Roots (both 1974).",5,7,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847

"The original session was for a Jacob Miller song called ""Baby I Love You So"", which featured Bob Marley's drummer Carlton Barrett playing a traditional one drop rhythm.",7,7,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
"When Tubby completed the dub, which also featured Augustus Pablo on melodica, Barrett's drums regenerated several times and created a totally new rhythm which was later tagged ""rockers"".",8,7,== Career == | === Dub music production ===,172847
