"He first scored monetary and contractual gains for Buddy Knox and Jimmy Bowen, one-hit rockabillies of the late 1950s, then parlayed his early successes into a position managing Sam Cooke, and eventually managed the Beatles and the Rolling Stones simultaneously, along with many other artists, becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the music industry during his era.",3,0,N/A,1284592
"Rather than offering financial advice and maximizing his clients' income, as a business manager normally would, Klein set up what he called ""buy/sell agreements"" where a company that Klein owned became an intermediary between his client and the record label, owning the rights to the music, manufacturing the records, selling them to the record label, and paying royalties and cash advances to the client.",4,0,N/A,1284592
"Although Klein greatly increased his clients' incomes, he also enriched himself, sometimes without his clients' knowledge.",5,0,N/A,1284592

"Klein's involvement with both the Beatles and Rolling Stones would lead to years of litigation and, specifically for the Rolling Stones, accusations from the group that Klein had withheld royalty payments, stolen the publishing rights to their songs, and neglected to pay their taxes for five years; this last had necessitated their French ""exile"" in 1971.",7,0,N/A,1284592

"Henderson hosted lavish, profitable live rhythm and blues shows at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and formed a partnership with Klein to begin doing the same in Philadelphia.",1,4,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"As Henderson's partner, Klein was introduced to Sam Cooke, a preeminent talent who was equally adept at writing, producing, and performing his numerous hit records.",2,4,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592

"Cooke created a holding company, Tracey Ltd., which was named after Cooke's middle daughter.",8,4,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"Klein, Cooke's manager, sneakily changed paperwork and listed himself as owner instead (and Sam Cooke as his employee).",9,4,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
Sam Cooke trusted him to protect him against crooked music executives but Klein used that trust to his advantage.,10,4,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"Tracey would manufacture Cooke's recordings and give exclusive rights to RCA to sell them for 30 years, after which the rights would revert to Tracey.",0,5,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"Cooke would receive a cash advance of $100,000 per year for three years, followed by $75,000 for each of two option years.",1,5,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"Instead of being paid the first $100,000 in cash, Cooke was paid in Tracey preferred stock, which would be taxed only when he sold it.",2,5,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"While the deal benefited Cooke, it also greatly benefited Klein, who ended up owning the rights to all of Cooke's recordings made since the contract re-negotiation when Cooke was killed in 1964 and his widow sold Cooke's remaining rights to Klein.",3,5,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592
"Klein's successful negotiations on behalf of Cooke brought him new clients, including Bobby Vinton and the Dave Clark Five.",4,5,== Sam Cooke ==,1284592

Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1,6,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"In 1964 Klein became the American business manager of Mickie Most, a former singer who was the savvy producer of hits for the Animals and for Herman's Hermits.",0,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"Klein extended to Most a million-dollar promise, adding that if he failed to deliver in only one month, Most owed him nothing.",1,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"Klein did deliver, through strategic re-negotiations of existing contracts and new producing opportunities for RCA, including offers for Most to produce for both Sam Cooke and Elvis Presley.",2,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"Though the latter two prospects did not materialize, Most was suddenly one of the most talked-about and financially gratified figures in the English recording industry, and Klein was a step closer to eventual agreements with both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.",3,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
His victories for Most won Klein access to several key English musicians.,4,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"He eventually negotiated vastly improved deals for The Animals, Herman's Hermits, the Kinks, Lulu, Donovan, and Pete Townshend of the Who.",5,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"However, Klein's help came at a price.",6,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"To shelter his clients' money from Britain's high taxation rate on income earned abroad, Klein held the money for them at the Chemical Bank in New York City and paid it to them over periods of time of up to 20 years.",7,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592
"Klein invested this money, which earned far more than Klein was obligated to pay to his clients, and he kept the difference in the accounts, thereby maintaining control over the money.",8,7,== Mickie Most and the British Invasion ==,1284592

"In the spring of 1965 Andrew Loog Oldham, co-manager of the Rolling Stones, saw in Klein a terrific business adviser and ally, one who could help him win an incipient power struggle with Eric Easton, a music business veteran who was then the other half of the band's management team.",0,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"Barely 21, Oldham was profoundly important in the development of the Stones' image, and in initiating the songwriting partnership of Keith Richards and Mick Jagger.",1,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"After some management mishaps, blame for which fell at Easton's feet, and Jagger's ascension in the band's hierarchy following ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", the Stones' first number one record in America, Oldham sought and received Jagger's blessing to bring Klein aboard for re-negotiation of the group's contract with Decca Records.",2,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"The label offered the band the opportunity to make $300,000 if their records continued to sell.",3,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"Klein countered with, and quickly secured, an arrangement paying the Stones twice as much, in the form of an advance.",4,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"He also forced London Records, Decca's American subsidiary, to sign a separate contract.",5,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"It too was for $600,000.",6,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"By the time Klein subsequently re-negotiated the deal one year later, Easton having been removed as co-manager, the Stones were guaranteed $2.6 million—more than the Beatles were making.",7,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
When Klein examined the Stones' management contract with Easton and Oldham he found that the latter were receiving a disproportionate share of the group's income: not only did Easton and Oldham receive an 8 percent royalty on sales of the Stones' singles—the Stones themselves received only 6 percent—but they also received a 25 percent commission on the Stones' income.,8,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"At Klein's insistence, Oldham increased the Stones' royalties to 7 percent and relinquished his commission.",9,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"Klein offered the Stones a million-dollar minimum guarantee, paid over a 20-year period to reduce the Stones' tax liability, to let him become their music publisher, based on his faith in the Jagger-Richards songwriting team.",10,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
He also arranged for a level of tour support and publicity far above anything the band had ever previously experienced for the Stones' 1965 American tour in support of the album December's Children.,11,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"Jagger, who had studied at the London School of Economics, gradually became distrustful of Klein, particularly for the latter's ability to insert himself as a profit participant in the group's ever-growing financial affairs.",12,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"For example, in 1968 Klein very profitably bought out Oldham's share in the band for $750,000.",13,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"By 1968 the Stones were so concerned with how their finances were being handled by Klein that they hired a London law firm, Berger Oliver & Co, to look into their financial situation and Jagger hired the titled merchant banker Prince Rupert Loewenstein to be his personal financial adviser.",14,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
Another possible factor in the Stones' dissatisfaction with Klein was that when the latter began to manage the Beatles he focused more of his attention on that band's affairs than on the concerns of the Stones.,15,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"In 1970, on the occasion of needing to negotiate a new contract with Decca, Jagger announced that Klein would be replaced as manager by Loewenstein.",16,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
The split between Klein and the Stones led to years of litigation.,17,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
In 1971 the Stones sued Klein over U.S. publishing rights.,18,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"The suit was settled the following year, with the Stones receiving $1.2 million as a settlement of all American royalties earned up to that point (and was essentially the $1.25 million advance that Decca had paid the Stones in 1965 that Klein had been withholding since August 1965).",19,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"However, the Stones were unable to break their contract with Klein, who held an additional $2 million of the Stones' money to be paid over a 15-year period, ostensibly for tax purposes.",20,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"Klein's company, ABKCO, continued to control the rights to publish the Stones' music and it was Klein who made a fortune off the band's all-time best-selling album, Hot Rocks 1964–1971.",21,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
In 1972 Klein alleged that some of the songs on their album Exile on Main Street had been composed while the Stones were still under contract with ABKCO.,22,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"As a result, ABKCO acquired ownership of the disputed songs and was able to publish another Rolling Stones album, More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies).",23,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"In 1974 negotiations over royalties led to a payment of $375,000 to the Stones and ABKCO's release of an additional Rolling Stones album, Metamorphosis.",24,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"In 1975 more lawsuits and negotiations resulted in a $1 million payment to the Stones for non-payment by Klein of songwriting royalties, and the release of four Rolling Stones albums including Rock and Roll Circus and Rolled Gold: The Very Best of the Rolling Stones.",25,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
In 1984 Jagger and Richards sued to break their publishing agreement with ABKCO because of non-payment of royalties.,26,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
The judge encouraged the two sides to reach a settlement.,27,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"Starting in 1986, when the introduction of compact discs brought great profits to the music industry, relations began to improve between Klein and the Stones.",28,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"In 2002 the Stones' album Forty Licks and the Licks Tour, celebrating the band's 40th anniversary, incorporated songs owned by ABKCO.",29,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592
"The Stones agreed to a five-year payment plan suggested by Klein's son, Jody.",30,9,== The Rolling Stones ==,1284592

"In February 1967, with an eye toward producing films and finding a way to invest his clients' money, Klein attempted to acquire Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.",0,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"His hopes were blunted when Edgar Bronfman, Sr., heir to the Seagram fortune, instead took control of the firm.",1,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"Klein then turned his attention to Cameo-Parkway Records, a Philadelphia-born, Los Angeles-based label which had enjoyed hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, thanks to Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell, Dee Dee Sharp and others, but which by 1967 was no longer prospering.",2,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"It was one of the first publicly traded record companies, making it ideal for a financial maneuver Klein had in mind, known as a reverse acquisition.",3,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
It was meant to take Allen Klein and Company public via its being acquired on paper by Cameo-Parkway.,4,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"By July 1967, Klein and his associate Abbey Butler had acquired a controlling interest and filed to rename Cameo-Parkway as ABKCO, which is an acronym for ""The Allen and Betty Klein Company.""",5,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"Fueled by speculation, the stock price increased from $1.75 a share in July 1967 to a peak of 76⅜ in February 1968 before the SEC halted trading.",6,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"The American Stock Exchange declined to reinstate the stock; instead, ABKCO continued to trade over the counter, and the stock price dropped to more realistic levels.",7,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592
"In 1987, Klein made ABKCO a privately held company.",8,11,== Cameo-Parkway and ABKCO ==,1284592

"In 1964 Klein approached the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, with an offer for the Beatles to sign with RCA for $2 million but Epstein wasn't interested, saying that he was loyal to EMI.",0,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"After Epstein died in August 1967, the group formed Apple Corps in January 1968.",1,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"They hoped it would provide the means for correcting Epstein's unfortunate business decisions, which had both limited their incomes and ensured high tax burdens.",2,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Although ""Hey Jude"", the Beatles' first Apple release, was an enormous success, the label itself was a financial mess, with little accountability for how money was being spent.",3,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Klein contacted John Lennon after reading his press comment that the Beatles would be ""broke in six months"" if things continued as they were.",4,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"On January 26, 1969, he met with Lennon, who retained Klein as his financial representative, and the next day met with the other Beatles.",5,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Paul McCartney preferred to be represented by Lee and John Eastman, the father and brother respectively of McCartney's girlfriend Linda, whom he married on March 12.",6,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Given a choice between Klein and the Eastmans, George Harrison and Ringo Starr preferred Klein.",7,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Following rancorous London meetings with both Eastmans, in April, Klein was appointed as the Beatles' manager on an interim basis, with the Eastmans being appointed as their attorneys.",8,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
Continued conflict between Klein and the Eastmans made this arrangement unworkable.,9,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"The Eastmans were dismissed as the Beatles' attorneys, and on May 8 Klein was given a three-year contract as business manager of the Beatles.",10,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
McCartney refused to sign the contract but was outvoted by the other Beatles.,11,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Once in charge of Apple, Klein fired a large number of the organization's employees, including Apple Records president Ron Kass, and replaced them with his own people.",12,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"He closed Apple Electronics, which was headed by Alexis Mardas.",13,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
Mardas resigned his directorship in May 1971.,14,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Klein's attempt to fire Neil Aspinall, a longtime confidant of the Beatles, was immediately thwarted by the band.",15,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Klein was hit with his first crisis in managing the Beatles when Clive Epstein, brother of Brian Epstein and chief heir to NEMS, the management company his brother had founded, sold NEMS to Triumph, a British investment group managed by Leonard Richenberg.",16,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"NEMS held a 25% stake in the Beatles' earnings, which Klein as well as the Beatles themselves desperately wanted to buy out.",17,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
This led to tough negotiations with Triumph.,18,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
Klein ultimately secured the Beatles' rights in their previous work for just four annual payments amounting to 5% of their earnings.,19,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"However, in the lead-up to those negotiations Richenberg commissioned a hostile investigative report on Klein, which The Sunday Times ran under the headline ""The Toughest Wheeler-Dealer in the Pop Jungle"".",20,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"An even more important battle to secure the Beatles a financial situation commensurate with their worldwide popular acclaim was with Northern Songs Ltd., the publishing company.",21,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Northern Songs was managed by Dick James, whom Brian Epstein had rewarded with the Beatles' publishing rights in return for his helping them get placed on a TV show, Thank Your Lucky Stars, early in their career.",22,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"But James had constructed a contract that gave him an outsized share, and Epstein hadn't understood its implications.",23,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"James knew that Klein would soon eliminate his perks, so he quickly offered to sell Northern Songs to ATV, run by entertainment mogul Lew Grade, rather than allow Lennon and McCartney an opportunity to buy back publishing rights to their own songs.",24,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Klein worked feverishly to pull together a consortium which would beat Grade's offer, but ultimately his efforts were derailed by infighting between McCartney and Lennon themselves.",25,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"In September 1969, while Klein was in the midst of renegotiating the Beatles' unsatisfactory recording agreements with EMI, Lennon told him of his plans to quit the group.",26,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
It was agreed that this was the wrong time to either make or announce such a move.,27,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"EMI was loath to re-negotiate, but their American subsidiary, Capitol Records, was so impressed by Abbey Road that they agreed to vastly improved royalty terms.",28,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
McCartney joined his bandmates in endorsing the deal Klein had secured.,29,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Abbey Road proved to be the Beatles' last true collaboration, but Klein recognised an opportunity in the band's shelved January 1969 album and related documentary project, both titled Get Back, to get another album release out of the splintered group while also fulfilling their obligation to provide one more film to United Artists, the studio that had previously released both A Hard Day's Night and Help!",30,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Phil Spector, the producer famous for his ""wall of sound"" recordings with artists such as the Ronettes and the Righteous Brothers, was eager to sign on as producer for the album, which was eventually titled Let It Be.",31,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"McCartney didn't approve of Spector, but the other Beatles did.",32,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
This proved to be McCartney and Klein's last face-to-face meeting.,33,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"However, Apple made $6 million in the first month following the May 1970 release of the record and the film.",34,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"Unhappy with production decisions on the Let It Be album and the other Beatles' decision to hire Klein as their manager, McCartney went public with his plans to leave the Beatles in April 1970.",35,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"He wanted to be released from his partnership with Lennon, Starr, and Harrison, who had in recent months proved a steady three-to-one majority against McCartney's proposals.",36,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
"The Eastmans convinced McCartney to file suit against his former bandmates for dissolution of the Beatles' partnership, which he did on December 31, 1970.",37,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
The judge ruled in McCartney's favor in March 1971.,38,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
He decided that the combined financial affairs of the former Beatles should be placed in the care of a receiver until mutually acceptable terms for their break-up could be found.,39,13,== The Beatles ==,1284592
