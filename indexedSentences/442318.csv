"He also married fellow musician Annette Peacock (they later divorced) and began a musical association with pianist Paul Bley, with whom he would go on to record nine albums.While in California, Peacock heard the music of Ornette Coleman.",9,4,== Career ==,442318

"It created a pivot for me to embrace a much larger musical universe.""",11,4,== Career ==,442318
Peacock reflected on how his thinking began to change:,12,4,== Career ==,442318
I can remember when I was in Los Angeles about 1959 and I noticed that I was playing less time...,0,5,== Career ==,442318
"In fact, playing the time became very irritating, it just felt like a straightjacket and I wanted to kind of break through that.",1,5,== Career ==,442318
"I simply started listening in myself to what a bass could do and I just began to intentionally play out of time, with some notions, some glimmers of what could be done.",2,5,== Career ==,442318
I noticed that the time could literally be there and I could be playing something that was basically ametric and yet it worked in some way as far as my ears were concerned... An interesting question [came up]: What would happen if we didn't play the time but just allowed it to be there.,3,5,== Career ==,442318
"Instead of going, 'dingdingding,' just allow it to be there and play something...",4,5,== Career ==,442318
"It opened up something for the pianist, it opened up something for the drums.",5,5,== Career ==,442318
"In 1962, Peacock moved to New York, where he played with Bley and musicians such as Jimmy Giuffre, Roland Kirk, George Russell, and Archie Shepp.",0,6,== Career ==,442318
"He also joined Bill Evans' trio, which included drummer Paul Motian, who would become a long-time associate, recording the album Trio 64 with the group in December 1963.",1,6,== Career ==,442318
"Peacock recalled that Evans' ""sense of harmony was exquisite...",2,6,== Career ==,442318
"The harmonies, and the way that he would voice the harmonies, made a melody not only believable but [so] you wanted to fall in love with it.",3,6,== Career ==,442318
"And because he played low, whatever the bass played, it could be heard; be an integral part of the music.""",4,6,== Career ==,442318
"In 1964, Peacock briefly joined Miles Davis' quintet, substituting for Ron Carter in April and May of that year.",5,6,== Career ==,442318
"Reflecting on his time with Davis, he stated:",6,6,== Career ==,442318
"Miles probably said one of the most brilliant, useful, and necessary comments I've ever heard.",0,7,== Career ==,442318
"Somebody was recording with him, and Miles looked at him and said, ""What I want to hear is what you don't know.""",1,7,== Career ==,442318
"That is really the key: not playing what you know, playing what you don't know.",2,7,== Career ==,442318
"To do that, you have to get very quiet inside, listen, and surrender to whatever that particular musical setting is.",3,7,== Career ==,442318
"So it doesn't make any difference whether I'm playing standards or free stuff, because you're giving up any kind of fixed positions or attitudes you may have about what it should or shouldn't be.",4,7,== Career ==,442318
"And to do that, you have to be vulnerable, to be in a place where you realize that what you're after, you cannot know.",5,7,== Career ==,442318
It's not conceivable.,6,7,== Career ==,442318
But it's there.,7,7,== Career ==,442318
It's the muse.,8,7,== Career ==,442318
So it's kind of a switch from the self playing the muse to the muse playing the self.,9,7,== Career ==,442318
"He also said that Davis ""didn't miss one thing.",0,8,== Career ==,442318
He heard everything that was happening all the time.,1,8,== Career ==,442318

"Regarding Ayler, Peacock stated:",7,8,== Career ==,442318
I think he brought something that was so genuine and so natural and so authentic that it was unavoidable.,0,9,== Career ==,442318
If someone could get past their ideas about what something should be and just listen.,1,9,== Career ==,442318
It is incredible...,2,9,== Career ==,442318
He was definitely a major influence for me...,3,9,== Career ==,442318
"He was about music, really, really about music and about continual development with the instrument, with technique, with all of that.",4,9,== Career ==,442318
So when he played it wasn't just squawks and beeps and honks and that kind of thing.,5,9,== Career ==,442318
"He was really, he was coming from a real place.",6,9,== Career ==,442318
It was authentic.,7,9,== Career ==,442318
It was really him.,8,9,== Career ==,442318

I was not in good shape.,0,11,== Career ==,442318
"I was doing a lot of drugs and alcohol, and I was discontented with myself...",1,11,== Career ==,442318
I happened to meet with Timothy Leary and... took acid.,2,11,== Career ==,442318
"The result of that was realizing, number one, that I didn’t know who the hell I was, whereas before, I’d always identified myself as a musician, a bass player.",3,11,== Career ==,442318
"Then, of course, came ""Who am I?""",4,11,== Career ==,442318
I also noticed that this desire to play music wasn't there anymore.,5,11,== Career ==,442318
"So the question was, what to do.",6,11,== Career ==,442318
So what I did was nothing.,7,11,== Career ==,442318
I stopped playing.,8,11,== Career ==,442318
"At this point, he decided to take a complete break from music.",0,12,== Career ==,442318
"He recalled: ""I got involved with macrobiotics and felt drawn to Eastern philosophies and medicine.",1,12,== Career ==,442318
"I became a regular practitioner of macrobiotics and eventually moved to Japan for two and a half years, studying the language, history, and Oriental philosophy.""",2,12,== Career ==,442318
"Reflecting on studying the Japanese language, he stated: ""There is a great lack of personal pronouns... And the effect that has... is after a time, there is a sense of spaciousness that opens up internally and externally.",3,12,== Career ==,442318
"""By 1970, while still in Japan, Peacock began to play again, recording Eastward in Tokyo with pianist Masabumi Kikuchi and drummer Hiroshi Murakami, followed by Voices the next year.",4,12,== Career ==,442318

"He resumed his musical relationship with Bley, touring Japan and recording Japan Suite.",7,12,== Career ==,442318
"In 1977, he recorded Tales of Another with Keith Jarrett and Jack DeJohnette; together, they would later become known as the Standards Trio due to their focus on jazz standards.",8,12,== Career ==,442318
"This was followed by December Poems, which features four solo bass pieces and two duets with saxophonist Jan Garbarek.",9,12,== Career ==,442318

"Regarding the trio format, Peacock stated:",12,12,== Career ==,442318
"If three people share a common history in a particular area of music and they all found something in that music that freed them, when they get together to play a piece everyone is 100% in that composition...",0,13,== Career ==,442318
"The question is, how much are you willing to give up to play this music?",1,13,== Career ==,442318
"I don't think it can work if you still have an agenda, if you feel you still need to prove something musically.",2,13,== Career ==,442318
That's not the point – it's just about the music.,3,13,== Career ==,442318
"So you're going to serve that, not yourself or somebody in the audience, not the critics or the reviewers.",4,13,== Career ==,442318
It's just the music.,5,13,== Career ==,442318
What does the music want?,6,13,== Career ==,442318
"The following decades saw Peacock continuing to play and record in the existing trio contexts, as well as with Marilyn Crispell, Lee Konitz, and Bill Frisell, and with a new trio featuring Marc Copland and Joey Baron.",0,14,== Career ==,442318

I follow a practice that I've done for about ten years.,0,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"I go through an actual daily practice of greeting the instrument, positioning myself with the instrument, paying attention to my posture, my breathing, the texture, the feeling of the instrument...",1,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"Sometimes that takes seconds, sometimes it takes five minutes.",2,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
Just getting a physical-sensory connection.,3,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"The next thing is when I actually start playing, I don't lose that physical connection.",4,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
To be completely aware of the sound that I'm playing and also what my feelings are about the sound of the instrument.,5,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
Just paying attention.,6,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"I don't try to do anything about it necessarily, but I just play, letting it be there.",7,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"I might be playing an arpeggio or a melody, but basically the attention is on the sensory-emotional aspect of my playing.",8,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
And then I let it go.,9,19,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"He also stated: ""If you always wake up in the morning and realize, 'Oh my God, I'm just a beginner!,' then you're in a really good place.",0,20,== Attitude toward music ==,442318

So my approach to playing is the realization that there are no guarantees anywhere.,4,20,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"So where do I want to be, what kind of state to do I want to be in when I'm playing?",5,20,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
It helped me to be really focused in a profound way and be really present.,6,20,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
"""Peacock also discussed the relationship between music and his daily practice of zazen (sitting meditation):",7,20,== Attitude toward music ==,442318
