"De Sabata's compositions are written in a late-romantic style with similarities to Respighi and, especially, Richard Strauss (one early commentator went so far as to call de Sabata the older composer's ""adoptive son"").",0,49,== Compositions ==,3353837
"It was as a composer that de Sabata first came to widespread attention, with the production of his opera Il Macigno in La Scala's 1917 season followed by performances of his orchestral Symphonic Suite (1912) and symphonic poem Juventus (1919) by conductors such as Walter Damrosch, Pierre Monteux, and Arturo Toscanini during the early 1920s.",1,49,== Compositions ==,3353837
"His compositions are little-known today, although Lorin Maazel had them in his repertoire.",2,49,== Compositions ==,3353837
"One reason may be that de Sabata did relatively little to perform and publicize his own works, preferring that his music should succeed or fail on its own merits.",3,49,== Compositions ==,3353837

"For example, a 1926 Time Magazine review described his Gethsemani as ""shallow, unoriginal music for which even the philanthropic genius of a Toscanini could not achieve distinction"", while a critic for International Record Review, writing in the early 2000s, said that the same work ""contains some of the loveliest orchestral sounds I have heard in years"".",5,49,== Compositions ==,3353837
