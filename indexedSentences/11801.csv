"In his last works, written just before his death in 1944 L'aeropoema di Gesù (""The Aeropoem of Jesus"") and Quarto d'ora di poesia per the X Mas (""A Fifteen Minutes' Poem of the X Mas""), Marinetti sought to reconcile his newfound love for God and his passion for the action that accompanied him throughout his life.",2,23,== Marinetti and Fascism ==,11801
