"In 1878 Hughes published his work on the effects of sound on the powered electronic sound pickups, called ""transmitters"", being developed for telephones.",0,6,== Microphone ==,862429
He showed that the change in resistance in carbon telephone transmitters was a result of the interaction between carbon parts instead of the commonly held theory that it was from the compression of the carbon itself.,1,6,== Microphone ==,862429
"Based on its ability to pick up extremely weak sounds, Hughes referred to it as a ""microphone effect"" (using a word coined by Charles Wheatstone in 1827 for a mechanical sound amplifier).",2,6,== Microphone ==,862429
He conducted a simple demonstration of this principle of loose contact by laying an iron nail across two other nails connected to a battery and galvanometer.,3,6,== Microphone ==,862429
"His paper was read before the Royal Society of London by Thomas Henry Huxley on May 8, 1878, and his new ""microphone"" was covered in the July 1 edition of Telegraph Journal and Electrical Review.",4,6,== Microphone ==,862429
Hughes published his work during the time that Thomas Edison was working on a carbon telephone transmitter and Emile Berliner was working on a loose-contact transmitter.,5,6,== Microphone ==,862429
Both Hughes and Edison may have based their work on Philipp Reis' telephone work.,6,6,== Microphone ==,862429
"Hughes would refine his microphone design using a series of ""carbon pencils"" stuck into blocks of carbon to better pick up sound but never patented his work, thinking it should be publicly available for development by others.",7,6,== Microphone ==,862429

Hughes seems to have come across the phenomenon of radio waves nine years before they were proven to exist by Heinrich Hertz in 1888.,0,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
In 1879 while working in London Hughes discovered that a bad contact in a Bell telephone he was using in his experiments seemed to be sparking when he worked on a nearby induction balance.,1,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"He developed an improved detector to pick up this unknown ""extra current"" based on his new microphone design and developed a way to interrupt his induction balance via a clockwork mechanism to produce a series of sparks.",2,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"By trial and error experiments he eventually found he could pick up these ""aerial waves"" as he carried his telephone device down the street out to a range of 500 yards (460 m).",3,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"On February 20, 1880, he demonstrated his technology to representatives of the Royal Society including Thomas Henry Huxley, Sir George Gabriel Stokes, and William Spottiswoode, then president of the Society.",4,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"Stokes was convinced the phenomenon Hughes was demonstrating was merely electromagnetic induction, not a type of transmission through the air.",5,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
Hughes was not a physicist and seems to have accepted Stokes observations and did not pursue the experiments any further.,6,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"A connection with Hughes phenomenon and radio waves seems to show up 4 years after Heinrich Hertz's 1888 proof of their existence when Sir William Crookes mentioned in his 1892 Fortnightly Review article on Some Possibilities of Electricity that he had already participated in ""wireless telegraphy"" by an ""identical means"" to Hertz, a statement showing Crookes was probably another attendee at Hughes' demonstration.",7,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"Hughes did not publish his findings but did finally mention them in an 1899 letter to The Electrician magazine where he commented that Hertz's experiments were ""far more conclusive than mine"", and that Marconi's ""efforts at demonstration merit the success he has received...",8,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
"[and] the world will be right in placing his name on the highest pinnacle, in relation to aerial electric telegraphy"".",9,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429

"The carbon rod and two carbon blocks, which he would refer to as a ""coherer"" in 1899 is also similar to devices known as crystal radio detectors.",12,8,== Probable pre-Hertz radio wave detection ==,862429
