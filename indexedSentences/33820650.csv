"In approximately 1967, an engineer attending Princeton University named Bob Meushaw, a friend of Massenburg, built a three-band, frequency adjustable, fixed-Q, IC op-amp-based EQ based on passive 2 resistor/2 capacitor or 3 resistor/3 capacitor “T” filters (a design that was primarily from a 1940s Bell Labs filter handbook).",7,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650
Meushaw’s design provided further inspiration for the EQ concept that Macneal and Massenburg were designing.,8,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650

The original unit was sold as the ITI MEP-130 (Mastering Equalizer Potentiometer 130) and was a console module.,12,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650
The original stand-alone unit was called the ITI ME-230,13,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650
(Mastering Equalizer 230) and was the first commercially available parametric EQ.,14,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650
Massenburg and Macneal type-set and printed a paper entitled “Parametric Equalization” in 1972 and Massenburg submitted it to the Audio Engineering Society in Los Angeles.,15,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650
The design was never patented.,16,4,== Invention of Parametric EQ ==,33820650

"John Ariosa from Sheffield Recordings bought the voice over production studio which included the ITI EQ Prototype as well as several Little Feat masters, and further down the road bought the ITI console after it sank in the Baltimore harbor.",4,6,== Purchase of ITI and Creation of Sontec ==,33820650
"Burgess Macneal bought the vinyl pressing plant, equalizers, intellectual property and other property of ITI and consequently became the owner of the ITI brand.",5,6,== Purchase of ITI and Creation of Sontec ==,33820650
"Macneal continued some of the ITI operations, rehired many of the ITI staff and renamed the brand as Sontec.",6,6,== Purchase of ITI and Creation of Sontec ==,33820650
"The first purchaser of the Sontec EQ was Sterling Sound, which still use their Sontecs at their facility.",7,6,== Purchase of ITI and Creation of Sontec ==,33820650

"Burgess Macneal and, software programmer, Gerry Block created the impressively precise Sontec Compudisk pitch and depth automation controller for disc cutting lathes, which they debuted at the 1980 AES Convention.",0,8,== Sontec Compudisk ==,33820650
"The Neumann VMS-80 appeared at the same convention, which made it difficult for people to decide whether to upgrade the whole lathe, or just improve their existing lathe's automation.",1,8,== Sontec Compudisk ==,33820650
"The most famous studio to adopt the Compudisk was The Mastering Lab, which added one to their highly modified vintage Neumann lathes.",2,8,== Sontec Compudisk ==,33820650
They added an entraining bar which connected the carriages of three lathes so that the master lathe's Compudisk could move the carriages of all three lathes identically.,3,8,== Sontec Compudisk ==,33820650
"Depth coils of the three lathes were operated electrically, in parallel, using the one controller for base depth and automated depth gain.",4,8,== Sontec Compudisk ==,33820650
"The Compudisk cost about 3 times as much as the Zuma, but both greatly improved on the space-saving capabilities of previous designs.",5,8,== Sontec Compudisk ==,33820650
