"Although Tatum was encouraged by comments from these and other established musicians, he felt that he was not yet, in the late 1920s, musically ready to relocate to New York City, which was the center of the jazz world and was home to many of the pianists he had listened to while growing up.",8,8,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557

"Tatum's only known child, Orlando, was born in 1933, when Tatum was twenty-four.",4,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557

"At the end of his first Three Deuces stint, Tatum moved to California, travelling by train because of his fear of flying.",11,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557
"There, he adopted the same pattern that he had followed from early in his career: paid performances followed by long after-hours sessions, all accompanied by prodigious drinking.",12,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557
A friend from his early days in California observed that Tatum drank Pabst Blue Ribbon beer by the case.,13,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557
"This lifestyle contributed to the effects of the diabetes that Tatum probably developed as an adult, but, as highlighted by his biographer, James Lester, the pianist would have faced a conflict if he wanted to address the diabetes problem: ""concessions – drastically less beer, a controlled diet, more rest – would have taken away exactly the things that mattered most to him, and would have removed him from the night-life that he seemed to love more than almost anything (afternoon baseball or football games would probably come next)"".",14,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557
"In California, Tatum also played for Hollywood parties and appeared on Bing Crosby's radio program late in 1936.",15,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557

"Continuing to travel by long-distance train, Tatum settled into a pattern of performances at major jazz clubs in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, interspersed with appearances at minor clubs where musicians of his standing did not normally play.",17,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557
"Thus, in 1937 he left Los Angeles for another residence at the Three Deuces in Chicago, and then went on to the Famous Door club in New York, where he opened for Louis Prima.",18,9,== Later life and career == | === 1927–1937 ===,152557

"In March 1938, Tatum and his wife embarked on the Queen Mary for England.",0,11,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"He performed there for three months, and enjoyed the quiet listeners who, unlike some American audiences, did not talk over his playing.",1,11,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"While in England, he appeared twice on the BBC Television program Starlight.",2,11,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
Four of his very limited number of compositions were also published in Britain.,3,11,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
He then returned to the Three Deuces.,4,11,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"The overseas trip appeared to have boosted his reputation, particularly with the white public, and he was able to have club residencies of at least several weeks at a time in New York over the following few years, sometimes with stipulations that no food or drink would be served while he was playing.",5,11,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Tatum recorded 16 sides in August 1938, but they were not released for at least a decade.",0,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"A similar thing happened the following year: of the 18 sides he recorded, only two were issued as 78s.",1,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
A possible explanation is that the increasing popularity of big band music and vocalists limited the demand for solo recordings.,2,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"One of the releases, a version of ""Tea for Two"", was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1986.",3,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557

"This was ""Wee Baby Blues"", performed by a sextet and with the addition of Big Joe Turner on vocals.",5,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Informal performances of Tatum's playing in 1940 and 1941 were released decades later on the album God Is in the House, for which he was posthumously awarded the 1973 Grammy for Best Jazz Performance by a Soloist.",6,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"The album title came from Waller's reaction when he saw Tatum enter the club where Waller was performing: ""I only play the piano, but tonight God is in the house.",7,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"""Tatum was able to earn a more than adequate living from his club performances.",8,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Billboard magazine suggested that he could make at least $300 a week as a soloist in 1943; when he formed a trio later that year, it was advertised by booking agents at $750 a week.",9,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
The other musicians in the trio were guitarist Tiny Grimes and bassist Slam Stewart.,10,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"They were a commercial success on 52nd Street, attracting more customers than any other musician, with the possible exception of vocalist Billie Holiday, and they also appeared briefly on film, in an episode of The March of Time.",11,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"As a solo pianist up to that point, Tatum was praised by critics, but the paying public had given him relatively little attention; with the trio, he enjoyed more popular success, although some critics expressed disappointment.",12,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Nevertheless, Tatum was awarded Esquire magazine's prize for pianists in its 1944 critics' poll, which led to his playing alongside other winners at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.",13,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"All of Tatum's studio recordings in 1944 were with the trio, and radio appearances continued.",14,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"He abandoned the trio in 1944, possibly at an agent's behest, and did not record with one again for eight years.",15,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Early in 1945, Billboard reported that Tatum was being paid $1,150 a week as a soloist by the Downbeat Club on 52nd Street to play four sets of twenty minutes each per night.",16,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"This was described much later as an ""unheard-of figure"" for the time.",17,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"The Billboard reviewer commented that ""Tatum is given a broken-down instrument, some bad lights and nothing else"", and observed that he was almost inaudible beyond the front seating because of the audience noise.",18,12,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Aided by name recognition from his record sales and reduced entertainer availability because of the World War II draft, Tatum began to play in more formal jazz concert settings from 1944 – appearing at concert halls in towns and universities all around the United States.",0,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"The venues were much larger than jazz clubs – some had capacities in excess of 3,000 people – allowing Tatum to earn more money for much less work.",1,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Despite the more formal concert settings, Tatum preferred not to adhere to a set program of pieces for these performances.",2,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
He recorded with the Barney Bigard Sextet and cut nine solo tracks in 1945.A fellow pianist from the years after World War II estimated that Tatum routinely drank two quarts (1.9 L) of whiskey and a case of beer over the course of 24 hours.,3,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
Almost all reports are that such drinking did not negatively affect his playing.,4,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Rather than being deliberately or uncontrollably self-destructive, this habit was probably a product of his being careless about his health, which was a common characteristic of jazz musicians, and his enthusiasm for life.",5,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Performances at concert settings continued in the second half of the 1940s, including participation in Norman Granz-produced Jazz at the Philharmonic events.",6,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557

"In the same year, he signed to Capitol Records and recorded 26 pieces for them.",9,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"He also played for the first time at Club Alamo in Detroit, but stopped when a black friend was not served.",10,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"The owner subsequently advertised that black customers were welcome, and Tatum went on to play there frequently in the following few years.",11,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
"Although Tatum remained an admired figure, his popularity waned in the mid- to late 1940s.",12,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557
This was because of the advent of bebop – a musical style that Tatum did not embrace.,13,13,== Later life and career == | === 1938–1949 ===,152557

"Tatum's four-year absence from the recording studios as a soloist ended when Granz, who owned Clef Records, decided to record his solo playing in a way that was ""unprecedented in the recording industry: invite him into the studio, start the tape, and let him play whatever he felt like playing.",0,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557
"[...] At the time this was an astonishing enterprise, the most extensive recording that had been done of any jazz figure.""",1,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557
"Over several sessions starting late in 1953, Tatum recorded 124 solo tracks, all but three of which were released, spread over a total of 14 LPs.",2,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557
"Granz reported that the recording tape ran out during one piece, but Tatum, instead of starting again from the beginning, asked to listen to a playback of just the final eight bars, then continued the performance from there on the new tape, keeping to the same tempo as on the first attempt.",3,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557
"The solo pieces were released by Clef as The Genius of Art Tatum, and were added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1978.Granz also recorded Tatum with a selection of other stars in 7 more recording sessions, which led to 59 tracks being released.",4,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557
The critical reception was mixed and partly contradictory.,5,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557
"Tatum was, variously, criticized for not playing real jazz, the choice of material, and being past his best, and praised for the enthralling intricacy and detail of his playing, and his technical perfection.",6,16,== Later life and career == | === 1950–1956 ===,152557

Musicologist Lewis Porter identified three aspects of Tatum's playing that a casual listener might miss: the dissonance in his chords; his advanced use of substitute chord progressions; and his occasional use of bitonality (playing in two keys at the same time).,0,23,== Style and technique ==,152557
