Pärt's works are generally divided into two periods.,0,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"He composed his early works using a range of neo-classical styles influenced by Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Bartók.",1,12,== Musical development ==,93783
He then began to compose using Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique and serialism.,2,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"This, however, not only earned the ire of the Soviet establishment but also proved to be a creative dead-end.",3,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"When early works were banned by Soviet censors, Pärt entered the first of several periods of contemplative silence, during which he studied choral music from the 14th to 16th centuries.",4,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"In this context, Pärt's biographer, Paul Hillier, observed that ""he had reached a position of complete despair in which the composition of music appeared to be the most futile of gestures, and he lacked the musical faith and willpower to write even a single note.",5,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"""In his work Credo (1968), written for solo piano, orchestra, and chorus, he employed avant-garde techniques.",6,12,== Musical development ==,93783
This work differed from his earlier atonal and tintinnabula works in its forms and context.,7,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"Inspired by 14th and 16th century liturgical music, he used a poly-stylistic compositional technique to express his faith in God while incorporating avant-garde techniques of the 20th century.",8,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"By definition, a credo expresses beliefs and guides religious action, and in his work it represents his faith in God.",9,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"The Soviets eventually banned the work due to its clear religious context, even though it incorporated avant-garde and a constructivist procedure.",10,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"The spirit of early European Polyphony informed the composition of Pärt's transitional Third Symphony (1971); thereafter he immersed himself in early music, reinvestigating the roots of Western music.",11,12,== Musical development ==,93783
"He studied plainsong, Gregorian chant and the emergence of polyphony in the European Renaissance.",12,12,== Musical development ==,93783
The music that began to emerge after this period was radically different.,0,13,== Musical development ==,93783
"This period of new compositions included the 1977 works Fratres, Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten and Tabula Rasa.",1,13,== Musical development ==,93783
"Pärt describes the music of this period as ""tintinnabuli""—like the ringing of bells.",2,13,== Musical development ==,93783
Spiegel im Spiegel (1978) is a well-known example that has been used in many films.,3,13,== Musical development ==,93783
"The music is characterised by simple harmonies, often single unadorned notes, or triads, which form the basis of Western harmony.",4,13,== Musical development ==,93783
These are reminiscent of ringing bells.,5,13,== Musical development ==,93783
Tintinnabuli works are rhythmically simple and do not change tempo.,6,13,== Musical development ==,93783
"Another characteristic of Pärt's later works is that they are frequently settings for sacred texts, although he mostly chooses Latin or the Church Slavonic language used in Orthodox liturgy instead of his native Estonian language.",7,13,== Musical development ==,93783
"Large-scale works inspired by religious texts include Berliner Messe, St. John Passion and Te Deum; the author of the famous text of Litany is the 4th-century theologian John Chrysostom.",8,13,== Musical development ==,93783
