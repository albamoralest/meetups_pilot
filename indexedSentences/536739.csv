"In Avempace's philosophy, it contains two key pillars, solitude and conjunction.",12,8,== Philosophy ==,536739
Solitude represents the isolation philosopher commonly seeks in order to protect himself from the corruption of society and conjunction refers to the philosopher's quest for the lowest celestial intelligence.,13,8,== Philosophy ==,536739

"On the other hand, Avempace wanted to use the perfect city as a model for the human soul.",7,9,== Philosophy ==,536739

"He alluded to the idea that the perfect man does not just require physical health, but spiritual health too.",12,9,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Avempace goes into more detail about the soul, which he describes of having both an acquired intellect, as well as an active intellect.",13,9,== Philosophy ==,536739
The active intellect has no basis coming from the physical world.,14,9,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Acquired intellect, however, is a result of experiences from the material world.",15,9,== Philosophy ==,536739
The perfect man can exist in either a perfect city or a non-perfect city.,16,9,== Philosophy ==,536739
"However, if a perfect man lives in a non-perfect city, he believes that they are to remain apart from the rest of the society.",17,9,== Philosophy ==,536739
This is because a non-perfect city is full of weeds.,18,9,== Philosophy ==,536739

"In addition, Avempace had changed forgotten non-syllogistic arts into “practical arts”, and wrote:""If some of them [the practical arts] employ syllogisms as medicine and agriculture do, they are not called syllogistic because their purpose is not [to convince another] nor to employ syllogisms, but to do some activity.",0,10,== Philosophy ==,536739

Avempace’s theoretic system sketched out all reality.,10,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Reality comes in many forms that includes motion and action.,11,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Avempace categorizes them between natural and artificial.,12,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Natural reality forms move bodies with power while bodies within artificial reality forms are unintentionally moved.,13,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
It also show how the body is viewed.,14,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
“Art (sina‛a) is the elaborated form abstracted from matter; it is abstracted from its matter.,15,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
The artificial form which exists in its matter does not have any power to move that which is in it nor to move something else.,16,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
This is the difference between artificial and natural forms.,17,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"""This example also represents the use of motion:“If there is a house, there is a foundation by necessity, and this kind of necessity is a relationship between the causes of the existing [object] and the final [cause].",18,10,== Philosophy ==,536739

"If the form is the final [cause] of a motion, motion follows it by necessity, and it is something evident because, if there is building activity, there will be a house, and if there is building, there is the art of construction, but if there is only the art of construction, there will be no building.",20,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"If [form] is acquired ‘by design,’ the other causes result in an orderly way from the final cause by necessity.",21,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
”This shows as human involvement is design.,22,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Absolute necessity reigns over the heavens.,23,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Avempace views necessity into three kinds: absolute, design, and material.",24,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Avempace demonstrates the moon eclipses using absolute necessity over time.,25,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Based on the relations of the moon eclipses, Avempace indicates “possibility shares necessity”.",26,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"He defines the body as an artificial collection of matter, which acts as an instrument for the soul to work through.",27,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"In doing so, he establishes the soul as an autonomous subject.",28,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Avempace believes that the human soul has three stages.,29,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"It starts in the plant stage, then to the animal stage, and finally to human stage.",30,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Each stage has an important attribute that the soul grows from.,31,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
The plant life is where the soul is provided with nourishment and growth.,32,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"In the animal stage, the soul is introduced to sensations.",33,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"When the soul moves to the human state, the soul gains common sense, imagination, and memory.",34,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Additionally, Avempace writes that the soul is geometrically formless.",35,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Because its form is beyond our understanding of geometric shapes, he states, it exists on a plane higher than that which we perceive with our bodies.",36,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Avempace is said to have been influenced by Platonic and Aristotelian views on the subject.,37,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"He credits Plato with the theory of the soul as a substance:""Since it was clear to Plato that the soul is assigned to substance, and that substance is predicated on the form and matter which is body, and that the soul cannot be said to be a body, he fervently defined the soul in its particular aspect.",38,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Since he had established that the forms of spheres are souls, he looked for the commonality of all [souls], and found that sense perception is particular to animals, [but] that movement is particular to all, and therefore he defined the soul as “something which moves itself.""",39,10,== Philosophy ==,536739
Avempace also describes four types of Intelligible forms.,0,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"They are described as bodies that have an eternal circular motion, an acquired intellect, those with external senses, and those with internal senses.",1,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"These ideas are consistent with Aristotle's descriptions of the soul and its properties in his treatise De Anima, though there is speculation that there were no Arabic transcriptions available to Avempace.",2,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Avempace, known as ""Ibn al-Sa’igh"" by Jewish tradition, is rarely recognized for his philosophical and astronomical works that influenced and were employed by many Medieval Jewish philosophers during and after his short life.",3,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
The first record of Avempace's influence on Jewish philosophy comes from a well-known Jewish contemporary author and philosopher: Judah Halevi.,4,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"In Chapter 1 of his greatest philosophical work, The Kuzari, Halevi summarizes three ideas directly influenced by works of Ibn Bajja: one's unification with the Active Intellect is attainable during their lifetime, this unification implies cognitive identity with others who are aware of the truth, and a philosopher's life is a solitary regimen.",5,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"The renowned polymath and Jewish philosopher, Maimonides, was possibly born in the same year of Avempace's death, yet he preserved and studied the works of the deceased Andalusian.",6,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"Maimonides admired Avempace for his achievements, stating that ""[Ibn Bajja] was a great and wise philosopher, and all of his works are right and correct"".",7,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
Maimonides also valued Ibn Bajja's commentary on Aristotle's works on astronomy.,8,11,== Philosophy ==,536739

Avempace rejects that feeling ultimate pleasure comes from witnessing the divine world internally.,11,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
"For Avempace, the highest form of spiritual happiness comes from science and the truth.",12,11,== Philosophy ==,536739
Science allows for the truth to be discovered.,13,11,== Philosophy ==,536739

"The velocity of a body is not inversely proportional to the density of the medium, but it is the retardation the motion is subject to by virtue of the medium, which is proportional to the density.",1,25,== Physics ==,536739
"If what Aristotle said was true, natural motion in a supposed void would not meet any resistance and it would not take time but be instantaneous.",2,25,== Physics ==,536739
"Also, the motion of the heavenly spheres, which do not traverse a medium, would occur instantaneously.",3,25,== Physics ==,536739
We see these motions occurring with different finite velocities: the motion of the fixed stars is very slow; the daily motion is very fast.,4,25,== Physics ==,536739
"These differences in velocity are due to the fact that the movers of the spheres differ in nobility and the more noble a mover, the faster is the motion of the sphere moved by it.”In",5,25,== Physics ==,536739
"relation to the example of the stone falling through the mediums air and water, Avempace also brings up an example of dust particles to explain his ideas on natural movements.",6,25,== Physics ==,536739
Dust particles are suspended in the air and naturally fall slowly.,7,25,== Physics ==,536739
"Despite having enough power to go down, it is still insufficient to displace the air underneath it.",8,25,== Physics ==,536739
"From Text 71; Ernest A. Moody, who is a notable philosopher, medievalist, and logician, offered four main reasons in favor of the view that Avempace was at least a major thinker within the paradigm of the ""Theory of an 'impressed force.'""",9,25,== Physics ==,536739

"""3.",16,25,== Physics ==,536739
"""Avempace's appeal to an 'impressed force' was also reflected in the fact that 'if we use modern terms, it might be said that the force of gravity, for Avempace, is not determined essentially as a relation between the masses of different bodies, but is conceived as an absolute indwelling power of self-motion animating the body like a soul.",17,25,== Physics ==,536739

"While there is no known account that lay's out Avempace's ideas over this topic, Avempace gives a short explanation in his commentary of Aristotelian Physics book 8.",21,25,== Physics ==,536739
An interesting piece by Avempace on the theory of projectile motion comes from his example involving a magnet and iron filaments.,22,25,== Physics ==,536739
Magnets present a problem with Aristotle's theory on projectile motion because nothing can be seen physically moving the iron.,23,25,== Physics ==,536739
"Avempace, however, believes that a magnet is more complicated than one might think.",24,25,== Physics ==,536739
"He presents the idea that the magnet actually moves the air which, in return, moves the iron.",25,25,== Physics ==,536739
"The central theory of the mover and the moved can be seen not only in his work in physics, but also in his work in Philosophy.",26,25,== Physics ==,536739
Ibn Bajja proposed that for every force there is always a reaction force.,0,26,== Physics ==,536739
"While he did not specify that these forces be equal, it is considered an early version of the third law of motion which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.",1,26,== Physics ==,536739
Avempace was a critic of Ptolemy and he worked on creating a new theory of velocity to replace the one theorized by Aristotle.,2,26,== Physics ==,536739
