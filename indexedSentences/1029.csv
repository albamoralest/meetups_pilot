"The keynote of Schweitzer's personal philosophy (which he considered to be his greatest contribution to mankind) was the idea of Reverence for Life (""Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben"").",0,49,== Reverence for life ==,1029
He thought that Western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation.,1,49,== Reverence for life ==,1029
In the Preface to Civilization and Ethics (1923) he argued that Western philosophy from Descartes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it.,0,50,== Reverence for life ==,1029
