Between November 1959 and February 1960 Bachmann gave five lectures on poetics at the Goethe University Frankfurt.,0,11,== Lectures ==,64314
Known as the Frankfurter Vorlesungen: Probleme zeitgenössischer Dichtung (Frankfurt Lectures: Problems of Contemporary Writings) they are historically and substantively Bachmann's central work.,1,11,== Lectures ==,64314
In it she explained recurring themes in her early literary publications and she discussed the function of literature in society.,2,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"Bachmann insisted that literature had to be viewed in its historic context, thus foreshadowing a rising interest in studying the connection between literary discourse and the contemporary understanding of history.",3,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"In the first lecture on Fragen und Scheinfragen (Questions and Pseudo Questions) Bachmann focused on the role of writers in the post-war society and lists essential questions that are ""destructive and frightening in their simplicity"".",4,11,== Lectures ==,64314
They are: why write?,5,11,== Lectures ==,64314
What do we mean by change and why do we want it through art?,6,11,== Lectures ==,64314
What are the limitations of the writer who wants to bring about change?,7,11,== Lectures ==,64314
Bachmann asserted that the great literary accomplishments of the 20th century were expressions in language and thus the poetic moral and intellectual renewal.,8,11,== Lectures ==,64314
In her mind the writer's new thinking and experience formed the core of the literary works.,9,11,== Lectures ==,64314
This in turn lets a writer come closer to a new language.,10,11,== Lectures ==,64314
She stressed that a new language was inhabited by a new spirit.,11,11,== Lectures ==,64314
Thus a writer may despair over the importance of language and she cited Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Ein Brief (1902) as the first articulation of this problem.,12,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"The second lecture Über Gedichte (On Poems) distinguishes poetry with its new power to grasp reality in its language, from other genres such as novels and plays.",13,11,== Lectures ==,64314
With reference to Günter Eich and Stefan George,14,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"she identified a new generation of poet-prophets whose mission it was to lead the world to the discovery of an ""ever purer heaven of art"".",15,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She set these poets apart from the surrealists who aspired to violence and the futurists who claimed that ""war is beautiful"".",16,11,== Lectures ==,64314
She argued that these two movements exemplified art-for-art's sake and that the careers of Gottfried Benn and Ezra Pound exemplified the friendship between pure aestheticism with political barbarism.,17,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She referenced Kafka on the need to ""take the axe to the frozen sea in us"" and the refusal to remain silent about the crimes in our world.",18,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"In the lecture she also named writings of Nelly Sachs, Marie Luise Kaschnitz, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Paul Celan as examples of new poetry.",19,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"In the third lecture on Das schreibende Ich (The Writing ""I"") Bachmann addressed the question of the first-person narrator.",20,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She was concerned with the accountability and authority, the authenticity and reliability of a person of narrating a work.",21,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She distinguished between the unproblematic ""I"" in letters and diaries which conceal the person from the author, and the unproblematic ""I"" in memoirs.",22,11,== Lectures ==,64314
She argued that Henry Miller and Louis-Ferdinand Céline placed themselves and their own personal experience directly at the centre of their novels.,23,11,== Lectures ==,64314
She referenced Tolstoy's The Kreuzer Sonata and Dostoyevsky's The House of the Dead as first-person narrators of the inner story.,24,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She argued that narrators could provide a new treatment of time (for example Italo Svevo), of material (for example Proust) or of space (for example Hans Henny Jahnn).",25,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"Bachmann asserted that in the modern novel the ""I"" had shifted and the narrator no longer lives the story, instead the story is in the narrator.",26,11,== Lectures ==,64314
In the fourth lecture Der Umgang mit Namen (The Close association with Names) Bachmann explored how names could have a life of their own.,27,11,== Lectures ==,64314
She discussed the use of names in contemporary literature.,28,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She identified ""denied names"" such as in Kafka's The Castle, ""ironic naming"" by Thomas Mann, ""name games"" in James Joyce's Ulysses and instances where the identity of the character is not secured by a name but by the context, such as in Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury.",29,11,== Lectures ==,64314
In the fifth lecture on Literatur als Utopie (Literature as Utopia) she turned to the question of what makes literature utopian.,30,11,== Lectures ==,64314
She argued that it was the process that was set in motion in the writer and reader as a result of their interaction with literature that made a work utopian.,31,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"She argued that literature could make us aware of the lack, both in the work and in our own world.",32,11,== Lectures ==,64314
Readers could remove this lack by giving the work a chance in our time.,33,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"Thus she argued each work of literature is ""a realm which reaches forward and has unknown limits"".",34,11,== Lectures ==,64314
"Bachmann's understanding of utopia as direction rather than a goal, and her argument that it was the function of literature to take an utopian direction stemmed from Robert Musil who had analysed European modernism in his dissertation on Ernst Mach.",35,11,== Lectures ==,64314

"Although German language writers such as Hilde Domin, Luise Rinser and Nelly Sachs had published notable works on women's issues in the post-war period it was only in the 1970s that a feminist movement emerged in West Germany.",0,13,== Legacy ==,64314
"After her death, Bachmann became popular among feminist readers.",1,13,== Legacy ==,64314
