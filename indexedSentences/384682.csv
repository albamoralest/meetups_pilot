"For Gubaidulina, music was an escape from the socio-political atmosphere of Soviet Russia.",0,10,== Aesthetic ==,384682

She associates the indeterminate nature of percussive timbres with the mystical longing and the potential freedom of human transcendence.,1,11,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"In an interview with the modern British composer Ivan Moody, Gubaidulina provides an explanation for how percussion is utilized in her works to show spiritualism.",2,11,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"She says,",3,11,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"... percussion has an acoustic cloud around it, a cloud that cannot be analyzed.",0,12,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"These instruments are at the boundary between palpable reality and the subconscious, because they have these acoustics.",1,12,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"Their purely physical characteristics, of the timpani and membranophones and so on, when the skin vibrates, or the wood is touched, respond.",2,12,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"They enter into that layer of our consciousness which is not logical, they are at the boundary between the conscious and the subconscious.",3,12,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"She was also preoccupied by experimentation with non-traditional methods of sound production, and as already mentioned, with unusual combinations of instruments, e.g. Concerto for Bassoon and Low Strings (1975), Detto – I, sonata for organ and percussion (1978), The Garden of Joy and Sorrow for flute, harp and viola (1980), and Descensio for 3 trombones, 3 percussionists, harp, harpsichord/celesta and celesta/piano (1981).",0,13,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"Gubaidulina notes that the two composers to whom she experiences a constant devotion are J. S. Bach and Anton Webern, although she had periods of devotion to Wagner, the Second Viennese School, and 16th century music, most notably Gesualdo da Venosa and Josquin.",1,13,== Aesthetic ==,384682
"Among some non-musical influences of considerable import are Carl Jung (Swiss thinker and founder of analytical psychology) and Nikolai Berdyaev (Russian religious philosopher, whose works were forbidden in the USSR, but nevertheless found and studied by the composer).",2,13,== Aesthetic ==,384682

"A profoundly spiritual person, Gubaidulina defines ""re-ligio"" as re-legato or as restoration of the connection between oneself and the Absolute.",0,15,== Style ==,384682
She finds this re-connection through the artistic process and has developed a number of musical symbols to express her ideals.,1,15,== Style ==,384682
"She does it through narrower means of intervallic and rhythmic relationship within the primary material of her works, by seeking to discover the depth and mysticism of the sound, as well as on a larger scale, through carefully thought architecture of musical form.",2,15,== Style ==,384682
Gubaidulina's music is characterised by the use of unusual instrumental combinations.,3,15,== Style ==,384682
"In Erwartung combines percussion (bongos, güiros, temple blocks, cymbals and tam-tams among others), bayan and saxophone quartet.",4,15,== Style ==,384682
"Melodically, Gubaidulina's is characterized by the frequent use of intense chromatic motives rather than long melodic phrases.",0,16,== Style ==,384682
She often treats musical space as a means of attaining unity with the divine—a direct line to God—concretely manifest by the lack of striation in pitch space.,1,16,== Style ==,384682
"She achieves this through the use of micro-chromaticism (i.e., quarter tones) and frequent glissandi, exemplifying the lack of ""steps"" to the divine.",2,16,== Style ==,384682
This notion is furthered by her extreme dichotomy characterized by chromatic space vs. diatonic space viewed as symbols of darkness vs. light and human/mundane vs. divine/heavenly.,3,16,== Style ==,384682
"Additionally, the use of short motivic segments allows her to create a musical narrative that is seemingly open-ended and disjunct rather than smooth.",4,16,== Style ==,384682
"Finally, another important melodic technique can be seen with her use of harmonics.",5,16,== Style ==,384682
"When talking about her piece Rejoice!, sonata for violin and violoncello, Gubaidulina explains,",6,16,== Style ==,384682
The possibility for string instruments to derive pitches of various heights at one and the same place on the string can be experienced in music as the transition to another plane of existence.,0,17,== Style ==,384682
And that is joy.,1,17,== Style ==,384682
Rejoice!,0,18,== Style ==,384682
uses harmonics to represent joy as an elevated state of spiritual thought.,1,18,== Style ==,384682
"Harmonically, Gubaidulina's music resists traditional tonal centers and triadic structures in favor of pitch clusters and intervallic design arising from the contrapuntal interaction between melodic voices.",0,19,== Style ==,384682
"For example, in the Cello Concerto Detto-2 (1972) she notes that a strict and progressive intervallic process occurs, in which the opening section utilizes successively wider intervals that become narrower toward the last section.",1,19,== Style ==,384682
"Rhythmically, Gubaidulina places significant stress on the fact that temporal ratios should not be limited to local figuration; rather, the temporality of the musical form should be the defining feature of rhythmic character.",2,19,== Style ==,384682
As Gerard McBurney states:,3,19,== Style ==,384682
In conversation she is most keen to stress that she cannot accept the idea (a frequent post-serial one) of rhythm or duration as the material of a piece. ...,0,20,== Style ==,384682
"To her, rhythm is nowadays a generating principle as, for instance, the cadence was to tonal composers of the Classical period; it therefore cannot be the surface material of a work.",1,20,== Style ==,384682
...,2,20,== Style ==,384682
"[S]he expresses her impatience with Messiaen, whose use of rhythmic modes to generate local imagery, she feels, restricts the effectiveness of rhythm as an underlying formal level of the music.",3,20,== Style ==,384682
"To this end, Gubaidulina often devises durational ratios in order to create the temporal forms for her compositions.",0,21,== Style ==,384682
"Specifically, she often utilizes elements of the Fibonacci sequence or the golden ratio, in which each succeeding element is equal to the sum of the two preceding elements (i.e., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.).",1,21,== Style ==,384682
This numerical layout represents the balanced nature in her music through a sense of cell multiplication between live and non-live substances.,2,21,== Style ==,384682
She believes that this abstract theory is the foundation of her personal musical expression.,3,21,== Style ==,384682
"The golden ratio between the sections are always marked by some musical event, and the composer explores her fantasy fully in articulating this moment.",4,21,== Style ==,384682
"The first work in which Gubaidulina experiments with this concept of proportionality is Perceptions for Soprano, Baritone, and Seven String Instruments (1981, rev.",0,22,== Style ==,384682
1983–86),1,22,== Style ==,384682
.,2,22,== Style ==,384682
"The 12th movement, ""Montys Tod"" (Monty's Death), uses the Fibonacci series in its rhythmical structure with the number of quarter notes in individual episodes corresponding to numbers from Fibonacci series.",3,22,== Style ==,384682
"In the early 1980s, she began to use the Fibonacci sequence as a way of structuring the form of the work.",4,22,== Style ==,384682
"Her use of the Fibonacci sequence to determine phrase and rhythm length replaces traditional form, creating a new form which to her is more spiritually in tune.",5,22,== Style ==,384682
"Gubaidulina also experimented with other like series, including the Lucas Series which begins by adding 2 instead of 1 to the initial value; the only thing setting it apart from Fibonacci.",6,22,== Style ==,384682
"These forms are still fluid, as every other movement in her symphony Stimmen...",7,22,== Style ==,384682
Verstummen... follows the Fibonacci form.,8,22,== Style ==,384682
"""It is a game!",9,22,== Style ==,384682
""", she would claim.",10,22,== Style ==,384682
"Later the Lucas and Evangelist series, sequences derived from that of Fibonacci, were added to her repertoire.",11,22,== Style ==,384682
"Valentina Kholopova, Gubaidulina's close friend and colleague, outlined the composer's form techniques in detail.",0,23,== Style ==,384682
"In addition to using the Fibonacci among other number sequences, Kholopova describes Gubaidulina's use of ""expression parameters""; being articulation, melody, rhythm, texture, and composition.",1,23,== Style ==,384682
The name suggests the immediate effects of the each parameter on the listener.,2,23,== Style ==,384682
"Each of these exists on a scale of consonance to dissonance, together forming the ""parameter complex"".",3,23,== Style ==,384682
"For example, she describes a consonant articulation as legato, and a dissonant one as staccato, but each of these can change from piece to piece.",4,23,== Style ==,384682
"According to Kholopova, music from before the 20th century left the responsibility of articulation to the performer, while now it begs to be more heavily illustrated by the composer.",5,23,== Style ==,384682
"She also cites the writings of Viktor Bobrovski on his research on macrothemes, or central ideas that may occupy larger frames of time, such as entire sections of a piece.",6,23,== Style ==,384682
"With this scale, pieces such as her Concordanza assume a mosaic form held together by Fibonacci-derived groupings of expression parameters, ""modulating"" between consonance and dissonance.",7,23,== Style ==,384682
"This technique appears most clearly in her Ten Preludes for Solo Cello as six of its movements are names after modulation between parameters, and two being single parameters.",8,23,== Style ==,384682
"Kholopova proposed that this scale could be used to analyze the music of any 20th century composer focused on texture, timbre and color, and that it is but one way to analyze music, signalling a continuing progression, catalyzed, according to Gubaidulina, by Webern.",9,23,== Style ==,384682

Piano music ==,1,24,== Piano music ==,384682
"Gubaidulina's entire piano output belongs to her earlier compositional period and consists of the following works: Chaconne (1962), Piano Sonata (1965), Musical Toys (1968), Toccata-Troncata (1971), Invention (1974) and Piano Concerto ""Introitus"" (1978).",0,25,== Piano music ==,384682
Some of the titles reveal her interest in baroque genres and the influence of J. S. Bach.,1,25,== Piano music ==,384682
"The Piano Sonata is dedicated to Henrietta Mirvis, a pianist greatly admired by the composer.",0,26,== Piano music ==,384682
"The work follows the classical formal structure in 3 movements: Allegro (sonata form), Adagio, and Allegretto.",1,26,== Piano music ==,384682
"Four motives (pitch sets) are utilized throughout the entire sonata, which also constitute the cyclical elements upon which the rhetoric of the piece is constructed.",2,26,== Piano music ==,384682
"Each motive is given a particular name: ""spring"", ""struggle"", ""consolation"", and ""faith"".",3,26,== Piano music ==,384682
"There are two elements in the primary thematic complex of the first movement: (1) a ""swing"" theme, characterized by syncopation and dotted rhythms and (2) a chord progression, juxtaposing minor and major seconds over an ostinato pattern in the left hand.",0,27,== Piano music ==,384682
The slower secondary theme introduces a melodic element associated with the ostinato element of the previous theme.,1,27,== Piano music ==,384682
"In the development section, these sets are explored melodically, while the dotted rhythm figure gains even more importance.",0,28,== Piano music ==,384682
"In the recapitulation, the chord progression of the first thematic complex is brought to the higher registers, preparing the coda based on secondary theme cantabile element, which gradually broadens.",1,28,== Piano music ==,384682
The second movement shifts to a different expressive world.,0,29,== Piano music ==,384682
"A simple ternary form with a cadenza–AB (cadenza) A, the B section represents an acoustic departure as the chromatic figurations in the left hand, originating in section A, are muted.",1,29,== Piano music ==,384682
"In the cadenza the performer improvises within a framework given by the composer, inviting a deeper exploration of the secrets of sound.",0,30,== Piano music ==,384682
"It consists of two alternating elements– open-sounding strings, stroke by fingers, with no pitch determination, and muted articulation of the strings in the bass register—separated by rests marked with fermatas.",1,30,== Piano music ==,384682
"The third movement is constructed of 7 episodes, in which there is a continuous liberation of energy accumulated during the previous movement.",2,30,== Piano music ==,384682
Two distinct aspects of the sonata—the driving force and the meditative state—can be seen through the architecture of the work as portraying the image of the cross.,0,31,== Piano music ==,384682
"The first movement is related to the ""horizontal"" line, which symbolizes human experience while the second movement reflects the ""vertical"" line, which represents man's striving for full realization in the Divine.",1,31,== Piano music ==,384682
"The meeting point of these two lines in music happens at the end of second movement, and that reflects transformation of the human being at crossing this two dimensions.",2,31,== Piano music ==,384682
"The third movement ""celebrates the newly obtained freedom of the spirit"".",3,31,== Piano music ==,384682
