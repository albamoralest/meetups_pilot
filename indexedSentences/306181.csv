By 1953 Rauschenberg had moved from the White Painting and black painting series to the heightened expressionism of his Red Painting series.,0,16,"== Artistic contribution == | === The White Paintings, black paintings, and Red Paintings ===",306181

"Considered one of the first of the Combines, Bed (1955) was created by smearing red paint across a well-worn quilt, sheet, and pillow.",2,19,== Artistic contribution == | === Combines ===,306181
The work was hung vertically on the wall like a traditional painting.,3,19,== Artistic contribution == | === Combines ===,306181
