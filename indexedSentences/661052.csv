"They received five first place awards in the Down Beat poll at the end of 1947, and similar awards from the other magazines.",1,25,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052

"Works from this period are more sophisticated than those written for the Artistry band, and are some of the first and most successful ""third stream"" compositions.",3,25,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
"The band criss-crossed the country, appearing in the nation's top concert venues, including Carnegie Hall, Boston Symphony Hall, Chicago Civic Opera House, Academy of Music (Philadelphia), and the Hollywood Bowl.",0,26,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052

"Thanks to Kenton's public relations acumen, he was able to convince concert goers and record buyers of the importance of his music.",4,27,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
Comedy numbers and June Christy vocals helped break up the seriousness of the new music.,5,27,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
Kenton's successes did not sit well with everyone.,0,28,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
"In an essay entitled Economics and Race in Jazz, Leslie B. Rout Jr. wrote that ""the real scourge of the 1946–1949 period was the all-white Stan Kenton band.",1,28,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
"Dubbing his musical repertoire 'progressive jazz,' Kenton saw his orchestra become the first in jazz history to reach an annual gross of $1,000,000 in 1948.""",2,28,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
"He contrasted this with a situation in which critical and public recognition of ""Dizzy Gillespie as the premiere bopper could not be transformed into coin of the realm.",3,28,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052

Kenton's most artistically and commercially successful band ceased to be at the top of their game.,5,28,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052
"On December 14, the Stan Kenton Orchestra played their last notes for over a year.",6,28,== Career == | ==== Progressive Jazz ====,661052

"The music was an extension of the works composed and recorded since 1947 by Bob Graettinger, Manny Albam, Franklyn Marks and others.",1,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Name jazz musicians such as Maynard Ferguson, Shorty Rogers, Milt Bernhart, John Graas, Art Pepper, Bud Shank, Bob Cooper, Laurindo Almeida, Shelly Manne, and June Christy were part of these musical ensembles.",2,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"The groups managed two tours during 1950–51, from a commercial standpoint it would be Stan Kenton's first major failure.",3,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
Kenton soon reverted to a more standard 19-piece lineup.,4,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"In order to be more commercially viable, Kenton reformed the band in 1951 to a much more standard instrumentation: five saxes, five trombones, five trumpets, piano, guitar, bass, drums.",5,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"The charts of such arrangers as Gerry Mulligan, Johnny Richards, and particularly Bill Holman and Bill Russo began to dominate the repertoire.",6,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"The music was written to better reflect the style of cutting edge, be-bop oriented big bands, such as those of Dizzy Gillespie or Woody Herman.",7,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Young, talented players and outstanding jazz soloists such as Maynard Ferguson, Lee Konitz, Conte Candoli, Sal Salvador, and Frank Rosolino made strong contributions to the level of the 1952–53 band.",8,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
The music composed and arranged during this time was far more tailor-made to contemporary jazz tastes; the 1953 album New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm is noted as one of the high points in Kenton's career as band leader.,9,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Though the band was to have a very strong ""concert book"", Kenton also made sure the dance book was made new, fresh and contemporary.",10,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
The album Sketches on Standards from 1953 is an excellent example of Kenton appealing to a wider audience while using the band and Bill Russo's arranging skills to their fullest potential.,11,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Even though the personnel changed rather rapidly, Kenton's focus was very clear on where he would lead things musically.",12,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
By this time producer Lee Gillette worked well in concert with Kenton to create a balanced set of recordings that were both commercially viable and cutting edge musically.,13,30,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Arguably the most ""swinging"" band Kenton was to field came when legendary drummer Mel Lewis joined the orchestra in 1954.",0,31,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
Kenton's Contemporary Concepts (1955) and Kenton in Hi-Fi (1956) albums during this time are very impressive as a be-bop recording and then a standard dance recording (respectively).,1,31,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Kenton in Hi-Fis wide popularity and sales benefited from the fact it was his greatest hits of ten years earlier re-recorded in stereo with a contemporary, much higher level band.",2,31,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
The album climbed all the way up to #22 on the Billboard album charts and provided much needed revenue at a time when Rock n Roll had started to become the dominant pop music in the United States.,3,31,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
It would become more and more difficult for Kenton to alternate between 'dance' and serious 'jazz' albums while staying financially solvent.,4,31,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"During the summer of the summer of 1955 (July–September), Kenton was to become the host of the CBS television series Music 55.",0,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"While it offered 10 weeks of great exposure to a rapidly expanding television audience, the show failed.",1,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
It was plagued by poor production techniques and a strange combination of guests that did not work well with what Kenton had envisioned.,2,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
He ended up being stiff and out of place with what the producers tried to achieve.,3,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
Kenton had to burn the candle at both ends flying in to do the show then flying back out to meet his band out on the road.,4,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
The New York production team was limited by using an American Federation of Musicians roster of local players; Kenton wanted his own band to do the show.,5,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
There would be another attempt for the Kenton organization to place the band on regularly scheduled television programming in 1958.,6,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"After six Kenton financed episodes on KTTV in Los Angeles, there would be no sponsors to step up and back the show.",7,32,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
One of the standout projects and recordings for the mid-1950s band is the Cuban Fire! album released in 1956.,0,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Though Stan Kenton had recorded earlier hits such as The Peanut Vendor in 1947 with Latin percussionist Machito, as well as many other Latin flavored singles, the Cuban Fire! suite and LP stands as a watershed set of compositions for Johnny Richards' career and an outstanding commercial/artistic achievement for the Kenton orchestra, and a singular landmark in large ensemble Latin jazz recordings.",1,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"""CUBAN FIRE is completely authentic, the way it combines big-band jazz with genuine Latin-American rhythms.""",2,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
The success of the Cuban Fire!,3,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
album can be gauged in part by the immediate ascent of Johnny Richards' star after its release; he was suddenly offered a contract by Bethlehem Records to record what would be the first of several recordings with his own groups.,4,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"At one point, Kenton faced a controversy in 1956 with comments he made when the band returned from a European tour.",5,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
The current Critics Poll in Down Beat was now dominated by African-American musicians in virtually every category.,6,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"The Kenton band was playing in Ontario, Canada, at the time, and Kenton dispatched a telegram which lamented ""a new minority, white jazz musicians,"" and stated his ""disgust [with the so-called] literary geniuses of jazz.""",7,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Jazz critic Leonard Feather responded in the October 3, 1956, issue of Down Beat with an open letter that questioned Kenton's racial views.",8,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Feather implied that Kenton's failure to win the Critics Poll was probably the real reason for the complaint, and wondered if racial prejudice was involved.",9,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
In hindsight the record shows Kenton's biggest sin is to have hastily fired off the comments.,10,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"However, less than 2% of the over 600 sidemen with the Kenton band were African American.",11,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"By the end of the decade Kenton was with the last incarnation of a 19-piece, 1950s-style Kenton orchestra.",12,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Many bands have been called a leader's ""best""; this last Kenton 1959 incarnation of the 1950s bands may very well be the best.",13,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"The group would pull off one of Kenton's most artistic, subtle and introspective recordings, Standards in Silhouette.",14,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"As trombonist Archie LeCoque recalled of this album of very slow ballads, ""...it was hard, but at the time we were all young and straight-ahead, we got through it and (two) albums came out well.""",15,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
By 1959 Stereophonic sound recording was now being fully utilized with all major labels.,16,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"One of the great triumphs of the Standards in Silhouette album is the mature writing, the combination of the room used, a live group with very few overdubs, and the recording being in full stereo fidelity (and later remastered to digital).",17,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
Bill Mathieu was highly skeptical of the decision to record his music like Cuban Fire!,18,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
in a cavernous ballroom.,19,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"Mathieu adds: ""Stan and producer Lee Gillette were absolutely right: the band sounds alive and awake (which is not easy when recording many hours of slow-tempo music in a studio), and most importantly, the players could hear themselves well in the live room.",20,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052
"The end result is the band sounds strong and cohesive, and the album is well recorded.""",21,33,== Career == | === 1950s ===,661052

"The Kenton orchestra had been on a slow decline in sales and popularity in the late 1950s with having to compete with newer, popular music artists such as Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin and The Platters.",0,35,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The nadir of this decline was around 1958 and coincided with a recession that was affecting the entire country.,1,35,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
There were far fewer big bands on the road and live music venues were hard to book for the Kenton orchestra.,2,35,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The band would end 1959 beaten up by poor attendance at concerts and having to rely far more on dance halls than real jazz concerts.,3,35,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"The band would reform in 1960 with a new look, a new sound, a larger group with a 'mellophonium' section added and an upsurge in Kenton's popularity.",4,35,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"The new instrument was used by Kenton to ""bridge the gap"" in range, color, and tonality between his trumpet and trombone sections.",0,36,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"Essentially it creates a conical, midrange sound that is common in a symphonic setting with a horn (French horn) but the bell of the instrument faces forward.",1,36,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"Kenton's 1961 recording The Romantic Approach for Capitol is the first of 11 LPs that would feature the ""mellophonium band"".",2,36,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Kenton arranged the whole first mellophonium album himself and it was very well received in a September 1961 review in Down Beat.,3,36,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The Kenton Orchestra from 1960 to 1963 had numerous successes; the band had a relentless recording schedule.,0,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"The albums Kenton's West Side Story (arrangements by Johnny Richards) and Adventures In Jazz, each won Grammy awards in 1962 and 1963 respectively.",1,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Ralph Carmichael wrote a superb set of Christmas charts for Kenton which translated into one of the most popular recordings from the band leader to date: A Merry Christmas!.,2,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"Also, Johnny Richards' Adventures in Time suite (recorded in 1962) was the culmination of all things the mellophonium band was capable of.",3,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"After the Fall 1963 U.S./U.K. tour ended in November, the mellophonium incarnation of Kenton bands was done.",4,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The conditions of Stan's divorce from jazz singer Ann Richards was that a judge ordered Stan to take a year off the road to help raise their two children or lose custody all together.,5,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Kenton would not reform another road band for tour until 1965.,6,37,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Kenton had ties from earlier writing of country/western songs that were a success with Capitol and again he tried his hand in that genre during the early 1960s.,0,38,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"In a music market that was becoming increasingly tight, in 1962 he cut the hit single ""Mama Sang a Song""; his last Top-40 (No. 32 Billboard, No. 22 Music Vendor).",1,38,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The song was a narration written by country singer Bill Anderson and spoken by Kenton.,2,38,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The single also received a Grammy nomination the following year in the Best Documentary or Spoken Word Recording category.,3,38,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The other attempt he made into that market was the far less successful Stan Kenton!,4,38,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"Tex Ritter!, released in 1962 as a full LP.",5,38,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"After the breakup of the mellophonium band, Kenton / Wagner (1964) was an important recording project that Kenton arranged himself, again moving towards ""progressive jazz"" or third stream music.",0,39,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
This album was not a financial success but kept Kenton at the forefront of 'art music' interpretation in the commercial music world.,1,39,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Stan Kenton Conducts the Los Angeles Neophonic Orchestra (1965) was an artistic success that garnered another Grammy nomination for the band leader.,2,39,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
During this time Kenton also co-wrote the theme music for the short lived NBC television series Mister Roberts (1965–66).,3,39,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The 1966–1969 Capitol releases for Stan Kenton were a severe low point for his recording career.,0,40,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Capitol producer Lee Gillette was trying to exploit the money making possibilities of numerous popular hits to include the 1968 musical Hair featuring contemporary rock music.,1,40,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"Due to lack of promotion by Capitol, four LPs were financial failures; this would be the last releases for Kenton under the aegis of long time Kenton producer Lee Gillette and Capitol.",2,40,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
"In fact, by the time it was recorded Kenton had no involvement in the Hair LP except for Kenton's name placed on the jacket cover; Ralph Carmichael and Lennie Niehaus were placed in charge of the project.",3,40,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
Two exceptions to this late 1960s period are the Billboard charted single the band cut of the Dragnet theme (1967) and another Kenton presents release featuring the music of composer and ex-bandsman Dee Barton: The Jazz Compositions of Dee Barton (1967).,4,40,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052
The album featuring Barton's music was another unsung artistic success for the Kenton band though widely unseen commercially by the a music listening public.,5,40,== Career == | === 1960s ===,661052

The transition from Capitol to Creative World Records in 1970 was fraught with difficulties during a time when the music business was changing rapidly.,0,42,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"As a viable jazz artist who was trying to keep a loyal but dwindling following, Kenton turned to arrangers such as Hank Levy and Bob Curnow to write material that appealed to a younger audience.",1,42,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"The first releases for the Creative World label were live concerts and Kenton had the control he wanted over content but lacked substantial resources to engineer, mix, and promote what Capitol underwrote in the past.",2,42,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
Kenton would take a big gamble to bypass the current record industry and rely far more on the direct mail lists of jazz fans which the newly formed Creative World label would need to sell records.,3,42,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
Kenton also made his print music available to college and high-school stage bands with several publishers.,4,42,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"Kenton continued leading and touring with his big band up to his final performance on August 20, 1978; he disbanded the group due to his failing health.",5,42,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
In June 1973 Bob Curnow had started as the new artists and repertoire manager overseeing the whole operation of the Creative World Records.,0,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
It was just the year before (in 1972),1,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
the Kenton orchestra recorded the National Anthems of the World double LP with 40 arrangements all done by Curnow.,2,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"As per Curnow himself, ""That was a remarkable and very difficult time for me.",3,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"I was managing (Stan's) record company with NO experience in business, writing music like mad, living in a new place and culture (Los Angeles was another world), traveling a LOT (out with the band at least 1 week a month) and trying to keep it together at home.",4,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"""When",5,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"Kenton took to the road during the early 1970s and up to his last tour, he took with him seasoned veteran musicians (John Worster, Willie Maiden, Warren Gale, Graham Ellis and others) teaming them with relatively unknown young artists, and new arrangements (including those by Hank Levy, Bill Holman, Bob Curnow, Willie Maiden and Ken Hanna) were used.",6,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
"Many alumni associated with Kenton from this era became educators (Mike Vax, John Von Ohlen, Chuck Carter, Lisa Hittle and Richard Torres), and a few went on to take their musical careers to the next level, such as Peter Erskine, Douglas Purviance and Tim Hagans.",7,43,== Career == | === 1970s ===,661052
