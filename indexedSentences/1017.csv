Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of spontaneous prose at Ginsberg's insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry.,4,60,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"The inspiration for Howl was Ginsberg's friend, Carl Solomon, and Howl is dedicated to him.",5,60,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
Solomon was a Dada and Surrealism enthusiast (he introduced Ginsberg to Artaud) who suffered bouts of clinical depression.,6,60,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Solomon wanted to commit suicide, but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy.",7,60,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"The institution refused, giving him many forms of therapy, including electroshock therapy.",8,60,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
Much of the final section of the first part of Howl is a description of this.,9,60,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Ginsberg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of ""Moloch"".",0,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017

"Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth Rexroth poem ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"", a poem about the death of one of Ginsberg's heroes, Dylan Thomas.",2,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
Moloch is mentioned a few times in the Torah and references to Ginsberg's Jewish background are frequent in his work.,3,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by peyote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull; he took it as a symbol of the city (not specifically San Francisco, but all cities).",4,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of Fritz Lang's film Metropolis (1927) and of the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward.,5,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control, including the conformist society of post-World War II America, focused on material gain, which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms.",6,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of humanity in multiple aspects, in that the decision to defy socially created systems of control—and therefore go against Moloch—is a form of self-destruction.",7,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Many of the characters Ginsberg references in Howl, such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke, destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle.",8,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
The personal aspects of Howl are perhaps as important as the political aspects.,9,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Carl Solomon, the prime example of a ""best mind"" destroyed by defying society, is associated with Ginsberg's schizophrenic mother: the line ""with mother finally fucked"" comes after a long section about Carl Solomon, and in Part III, Ginsberg says: ""I'm with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother.""",10,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017
"Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write Howl was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother, an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly.",11,61,== Work == | === Inspiration from friends ===,1017

"Ginsberg's poetry was strongly influenced by Modernism (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), Romanticism (specifically William Blake and John Keats), the beat and cadence of jazz (specifically that of bop musicians such as Charlie Parker), and his Kagyu Buddhist practice and Jewish background.",0,63,== Work == | === Inspiration from mentors and idols ===,1017

From the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friends—not to mention his own experiments—Ginsberg developed an individualistic style that's easily identified as Ginsbergian.,0,68,== Work == | === Style and technique ===,1017
"Ginsberg stated that Whitman's long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further, and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form.",1,68,== Work == | === Style and technique ===,1017

Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems.,5,68,== Work == | === Style and technique ===,1017

"Howl and Kaddish, arguably his two most important poems, are both organized as an inverted pyramid, with larger sections leading to smaller sections.",8,68,== Work == | === Style and technique ===,1017
