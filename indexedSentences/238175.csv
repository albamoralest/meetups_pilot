"Early in his career, Silver composed contrafacts and blues-based melodies (including ""Doodlin'"" and ""Opus de Funk"").",0,21,== Compositions ==,238175
"The latter was ""a typical Silver creation: advanced in its harmonic structure and general approach but with a catchy tune and finger-snapping beat.""",1,21,== Compositions ==,238175
"His innovative incorporation of gospel and blues sounds into jazz compositions took place while they were also being added to rock 'n' roll and R&B pieces.Silver soon expanded the range and style of his writing, which grew to include ""funky groove tunes, gentle mood pieces, vamp songs, outings in 3/4 and 6/8 time, Latin workouts of various stripes, up-tempo jam numbers, and examples of almost any and every other kind of approach congruent with the hard bop aesthetic.""",2,21,== Compositions ==,238175
"An unusual case is ""Peace"", a ballad that prioritizes a calm mood over melodic or harmonic effects.",3,21,== Compositions ==,238175
"Owens observed that ""Many of his compositions contain no folk blues or gospel music elements, but instead have highly chromatic melodies supported by richly dissonant harmonies"".",4,21,== Compositions ==,238175
"The compositions and arrangements were also designed to make Silver's typical line-up sound larger than a quintet.Silver himself commented that inspiration came from multiple sources: ""I'm inspired by nature and by some of the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life.",5,21,== Compositions ==,238175

Silver was among the most influential jazz musicians of his lifetime.,0,23,== Influence and legacy ==,238175
"Grove Music Online describes his legacy as at least fourfold: as a pioneer of hard bop; as a user of what became the archetypal quintet instrumentation of tenor saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums; as a developer of young musicians who went on to become important players and bandleaders; and for his skill as a composer and arranger.Silver was also an influence as a pianist: his first Blue Note recording as leader ""redefined the jazz piano, which up until then was largely modeled on the dexterity and relentless attack of Bud Powell"", in Myers' words.",1,23,== Influence and legacy ==,238175
"As early as 1956, Silver's piano playing was described by Down Beat as ""a key influence on a large segment of modern jazz pianists.""",2,23,== Influence and legacy ==,238175
"This went on to include Ramsey Lewis, Les McCann, Bobby Timmons, and Cecil Taylor, who was impressed by Silver's aggressive style.Silver's legacy as a composer may be greater than as a pianist, because his works, many of which are jazz standards, continue to be performed and recorded worldwide.",3,23,== Influence and legacy ==,238175
"As a composer, he led a return to an emphasis on melody, observed critic John S. Wilson: for a long time, jazz musicians had written contrafacts of great technical complexity, but ""Silver wrote originals that were not only actually original but memorably melodic, presaging a gradual return to melodic creativity among writing jazzmen.""",4,23,== Influence and legacy ==,238175
