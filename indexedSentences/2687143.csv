"One of Schwantner's early works, Diaphonia intervallum (1967) distinctly foreshadowed the important style traits that would later exist in his music.",0,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143

"Upon his appointment to the faculty of the Eastman School of Music, Schwantner's work Consortium I was premiered in 1970.",2,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143
"This piece clearly illustrates his personal use of serialism, including many twelve-tone rows hidden among the texture and using a specific intervallic structure to provide cohesion.",3,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143
Consortium II also continued this emphasis on his personal application of serialism.,4,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143

"Even as he embraces tonal centers, Schwantner resists the very conventional employment of the dominant-tonic relationships and the Western music expansion of that concept.",11,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143
"Rather, Schwantner's tonal centers are created by pitch emphasis, perhaps like the American composer Aaron Copland in a piece like El Salón México.",12,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143
His serialism roots even purvey his tonal structures; clearly defined major and minor scales are scarce in Schwantner's music.,13,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143
"Instead, he uses pitch sets to establish organization.",14,5,== Compositional style ==,2687143
