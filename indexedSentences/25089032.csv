"In a review of her 2011 Carnegie Hall debut, The New York Times wrote:",0,33,== Reviews ==,25089032
"From the opening piece, an early Scriabin prelude, Ms. Wang played this Chopinesque music, all rippling left-hand figures and dreamy melodic lines, with a delicacy, poetic grace and attention to inner musical details that commanded respect.",0,34,== Reviews ==,25089032
"After intermission she offered a rhapsodic, uncommonly nuanced account of the formidable Liszt Sonata in B minor.",0,35,== Reviews ==,25089032
"But the most revealing performance came in Prokofiev's Piano Sonata No. 6 in A. Completed in 1940, this nearly 30-minute work channels some barbaric, propulsive, harmonically brittle outbursts into a formal four-movement sonata structure.",1,35,== Reviews ==,25089032
"In most readings, intriguing tension results from hearing music of such aggressive modernism reined in by Neo-Classical constraints.",2,35,== Reviews ==,25089032
Ms. Wang reconciled these conflicting elements through a performance of impressive clarity and detail.,3,35,== Reviews ==,25089032
"In June 2012, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Wang is ""quite simply, the most dazzlingly, uncannily gifted pianist in the concert world today, and there's nothing left to do but sit back, listen and marvel at her artistry.",0,36,== Reviews ==,25089032
"""From a May 2013 Carnegie Hall concert, The New York Times reported that Wang's ""fortissimos were fearsome, but so, in a quieter way, were the longing melodic lines of the first movement of Rachmaninoff's Sonata No. 2.""",1,36,== Reviews ==,25089032
The reviewer added:,2,36,== Reviews ==,25089032
The liquidity of her phrasing in the second movement of Scriabin's Sonata No. 2 eerily evoked the sound of woodwinds.,0,37,== Reviews ==,25089032
"In that composer's Sonata No. 6 she juxtaposed colors granitic and gauzy to eerily brilliant effect before closing the written program with a rabid rendition of the one-piano version of ""La valse"", accentuating the sickliness of Ravel's distorted waltzes.",1,37,== Reviews ==,25089032

"In a much-quoted 2011 review of a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles Times classical music critic Mark Swed wrote:",1,41,== Reviews ==,25089032
"But it was Yuja Wang's orange dress for which Tuesday night is likely to be remembered…  Her dress Tuesday was so short and tight that had there been any less of it, the Bowl might have been forced to restrict admission to any music lover under 18 not accompanied by an adult.",0,42,== Reviews ==,25089032
