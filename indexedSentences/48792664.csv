"Shortly after Deeny became a Name, several serious problems emerged within Lloyd's, causing severe losses for many members (including Deeny himself).",0,16,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
The total lost at Lloyd's between 1988 and 1992 was estimated to be £8 billion.,1,16,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
This occurred for several reasons.,2,16,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"Due to the nature of Lloyd's business, it was often the case that a Name was liable to pay for claims made on policies established before they became members.",0,17,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"This was because Names of Lloyd's were required to join groups called syndicates, which existed for one calendar year.",1,17,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
Each syndicate was organised by a managing agent who hired underwriters to sell insurance to brokers.,2,17,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"When a syndicate disbanded and estimated its profit or loss, it had to account for the fact that some claims might have been incurred but not reported that year.",3,17,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
It also needed to account for the fact that many insurance policies are valid for longer than one year.,4,17,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"A syndicate would therefore make an estimate of the total losses that might be incurred from each policy in the future, and then buy reinsurance to cover these estimated future losses.",0,18,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
Such reinsurance was often sold by other Lloyd's syndicates – often by the same syndicate who simply reformed in subsequent calendar years.,1,18,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
This practice seemed to work for many years until the 1980s when health claims due to asbestos and environmental damage started to emerge.,0,19,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"It quickly became apparent to many Lloyd's syndicates that their predecessors had dramatically underestimated future claims, causing them significant losses.: 32–35 Another problem that emerged around the same time was dubbed the LMX Spiral.",1,19,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
It involved syndicates protecting themselves against huge losses by seeking reinsurance.,2,19,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"For example, an insurer might sell a policy for an oil rig offering cover for any level of disaster, but would then seek to buy reinsurance for any claims over £10 million.",3,19,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"This was a common practice but was unregulated, permitting syndicates to reinsurance each other without keeping track of who exactly was liable.:",0,20,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"36–42  In an interview for the Telegraph, Deeny described the LMX spiral as follows:",1,20,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
The spiral involved incompetent underwriters who could not find enough normal decent insurance business so they ended up just reinsuring each other.,0,21,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"The risks were going around and round in circles, the brokers involved were taking commission and the risk ended up being concentrated at a small number of syndicates at Lloyd's.",1,21,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"Consequently, many syndicates had considerably underestimated the funds they required to protect against claims, causing significant losses for many Names.",0,22,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"And, since Lloyd's members had always operated with 'unlimited' liability (meaning all of their personal assets could be required to cover losses)",1,22,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
some Names were forced into bankruptcy.,2,22,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
Deeny also cites 'time and distance' policies as creating misleading accounts.,0,23,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664

"Under these policies, a large premium is paid and you are guaranteed back a fixed amount after a certain number of years.",0,24,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"The difference between the premium and the eventual recovery is treated as a trading profit, which is not unreasonable, but it's paid in the year you take out the policy.",1,24,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664
"The idea of taking a profit you won't earn for 10 years is appalling, and no-one every explained to the Names that this was going on.",2,24,== Career == | ==== 1980s Problems ====,48792664

"Given his accountancy experience and that, ""with concert promotion, you are effectively gambling on how many tickets an artiste sells,"" Deeny was one of the few non-working Names (members that did not actively participate in the business) who understood the nature of the failures within Lloyd's.: 135 Consequently, Deeny quickly became a prominent figure in seeking compensation for the Names.",0,26,== Career == | ==== Gooda Walker Action Group ====,48792664
His first major contribution was in the debate of who exactly to sue.,1,26,== Career == | ==== Gooda Walker Action Group ====,48792664
The losses Deeny suffered resulted from the managing agent Gooda Walker.,2,26,== Career == | ==== Gooda Walker Action Group ====,48792664

"Deeny then became the action group's chairman in March 1993, repeatedly persuading the action group's members to decline offers of a settlement from Lloyd's,  arguing that the compensation awarded through legal action could be much larger.",0,27,== Career == | ==== Gooda Walker Action Group ====,48792664

"Mr Justice Phillips agreed with the action group, remarking that:",1,30,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
...the fact that a Lloyd's name deliberately agreed to expose himself to unlimited liability did not mean that he anticipated or accepted that when he joined a syndicate the active underwriter would deliberately expose him to the risk of such liability.,0,31,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
"On the contrary, the name would reasonably expect the underwriter to exercise due skill and care to prevent him from suffering losses.",1,31,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
Wilde Sapte –the action group's litigators– analysed the 150-page judgement and estimated that the Names would be awarded £504 million in compensation.,0,32,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
"Before the proceedings, the Gooda Walker Action Group were offered 23% of the £900 million proposed by Lloyd's as an out-of-court settlement to litigating Names.",1,32,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
"This amounted to around an average settlement of £67,600 each to compensate an average loss of £189,000.",2,32,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
"Instead, the plaintiffs were awarded almost triple that – an average of £167,000 each.",3,32,== Career == | ==== Deeny vs. Gooda Walker ====,48792664
