"Schutz was strongly influenced by Ludwig von Mises, Henri Bergson, William James, and Edmund Husserl, as well as Max Weber.",0,6,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"Drawing on phenomenology, Schutz's principal aim was to create a philosophical foundation for the social sciences.",0,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"While Schutz's work paralleled George Herbert Mead’s analysis of the meanings within social interactions, Schutz was highly critical of Mead’s behavioristic approach.: xviii  Although Schutz was never a student of Husserl, he and colleague Felix Kaufmann intensively studied Husserl's work in order to seek a basis for Weber's interpretive sociology and for Austrian economic theory.",1,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"In 1932, Schutz’s efforts resulted in his first published book, Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt ('The Meaningful Structure of the Social World') which was published in English as The Phenomenology of the Social World.",2,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"Schutz argues that social science must be grounded in analysis of what Husserl referred to as 'the natural attitude', the assumptions that structure everyday perceptions and actions in the social world.",3,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"Schutz retains Weber's conception of social science as properly committed to the principle of value neutrality, but also to value relevance, and that its investigations must rely on “ideal types”.",4,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"He viewed the technique of bracketing, drawn from Husserlian phenomenology, as a way beyond the limitations of ideal-type analysis.",5,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"This publication brought him to the attention of Husserl, whom he visited frequently and corresponded with until Husserl's death in 1938.",6,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"Even so, when Husserl asked Schutz to be his assistant, he was unable to accept the offer at Freiburg University for personal reasons.",7,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
: xviii Schutz's main area of concern was the ways in which people grasp the consciousness of others while living within their own streams of consciousness.,8,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"He spoke much about intersubjectivity, in a broader sense, using it in reference to the social world, specifically the social nature of knowledge.",9,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"A great deal of his work deals with the ""lifeworld,"" in which people create social reality under the constraints of preexisting social and cultural factors and structures.",10,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"He was very focused on the ""dialectical relationship between the way people construct social reality and the obdurate social and cultural reality that they inherit from those who preceded them in the social world.",11,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"""Schutz is also known for his belief that humans attempt to typify everything; i.e., to categorize people and things to better understand them within the context of society.",12,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
He believed that the various typifications we use inform how we understand and interact with people and objects in the social world.,13,7,== Intellectual career ==,106139
Schutz's theories and conceptions are illuminated through an intense and insightful correspondence with Harvard scholar Talcott Parsons.,0,8,== Intellectual career ==,106139
"The thrust of the discussion centered on the meaning of the concept ""social action.""",1,8,== Intellectual career ==,106139
Whether the Schutz-Parsons correspondence can be characterized as “dialogue” rather than “debate” has been analyzed by Rehorick (1980).,2,8,== Intellectual career ==,106139
Further insights into the fundamental differences between Schutz and Parsons is provided by a critical examination of original correspondence that brought in a third scholarly voice—that of Eric Voegelin.,3,8,== Intellectual career ==,106139

"Heavily influenced by Schutz's work as his student, Thomas Luckmann ultimately finished Schutz's work on the structures of the lifeworld by filling out his unfinished notes after Schutz died.",1,10,== Legacy ==,106139
"As noted by Farganis (2011), Peter L. Berger, also a student of Schutz's, was arguably the best-known living sociologist influenced by Schutz, especially through his creation of the social construction theory, which explains how the processes of externalization, objectification, and internalization contribute to the social construction of reality.",2,10,== Legacy ==,106139

"""Phenomenology originated with Edmund Husserl, who Schutz studied and even met.",2,12,== Legacy == | === Phenomenology ===,106139
There are many assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its creation.,3,12,== Legacy == | === Phenomenology ===,106139
"First, it rejects the concept of objective research: phenomenologists would rather group presumptions through a process called phenomenological epoche.",4,12,== Legacy == | === Phenomenology ===,106139

Most of Schutz's work concerned the methods used for the construction of reality through everyday experiences.,1,14,== Legacy == | === Social phenomenology ===,106139

"Rather than attempting to uncover and document the social structures which influence our social world Schutz and other sociological phenomenologists seek not only to identify the content of our consciousness related to our conception of the social reality of everyday life but also, how this reality comes to assume the form it is.",4,14,== Legacy == | === Social phenomenology ===,106139
"In essence, Schutz and social phenomenologists are principally concerned with the happenings of everyday life, or what Schutz refers to as the lifeworld, “an intersubjective world in which people both create social reality and are constrained by the preexisting social and cultural structures created by their predecessors.""",5,14,== Legacy == | === Social phenomenology ===,106139

Schutz's division of Husserl's lebenswelt (the mundane 'lifeworld') into four distinct sub-worlds is perhaps his most influential theoretical contribution.,0,16,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
The theory of the lifeworld is that social experience creates a world that is separated between:: xxvii,1,16,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
the social reality that has been directly experienced; and,0,17,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139

"The former consists of the umwelt ('environment'), the environment defined through the perception and action of agents.",1,18,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
"This is an environment of consociates, or fellow-men; of the man who ""shares with me a community of space and a community of time."": 163 In contrast, those who Schutz did not deem his fellow-men, he put them in three classes:: xxvii",2,18,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
the world of contemporaries (mitwelt);,0,19,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139

the world of successors (folgewelt).,0,21,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
"The last two represent the past and the future, whereas one's contemporaries share a community of time, if not space, and are different from the predecessors and successors because it is possible for them to become fellow-men or consociates.: xxvii Schutz was interested in documenting the transition from direct to indirect experience and the series of experiences in between.: 177  He also wanted to map the progressive anonymisation of the contemporaries (mitwelt), which was a measurement of increasing anonymity of ""my absent friend, his brother whom he has described to me, the professor whose books I have read, the postal clerk, the Canadian Parliament, abstract entities like Canada herself, the rules of English grammar, or the basic principles of jurisprudence."": xxviii  Schutz argued that the more one goes into the contemporary world, the more anonymous the contemporary inhabitants become, with the most anonymous being artifacts of any kind that hold meaning, context, and suggest there are unknown people.: 181",1,21,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
"In his later writings, Schutz explored how everyday social experiences that pertain to these dimensions are most often intertwined in varying degrees of anonymity.",0,22,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
"For instance:[I]f in a face-to-face relationship with a friend I discuss a magazine article dealing with the attitude of the President and Congress toward China, I am in a relationship not only with the perhaps anonymous contemporary writer of the article but also with the contemporary individual or collective actors on the social scene designated by the terms, 'President', 'Congress', 'China'",1,22,== Legacy == | ==== The four divisions of the lifeworld ====,106139
