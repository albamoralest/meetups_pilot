"While cylinder phonographs had been successfully equipped with clockwork motors, the disc playing Gramophone presented a number of design challenges in this regard.",6,8,== Biography == | === Eldridge R. Johnson Manufacturing Company ===,3184840
Foremost was the drag that the needle and soundbox created when applied to the outer edge of the disc.,7,8,== Biography == | === Eldridge R. Johnson Manufacturing Company ===,3184840

Berliner's process for creating master records involved coating a zinc disc with an acid-resistant fatty film and then scratching the coating away with a recording stylus.,2,11,== Biography == | === Consolidated Talking Machine Company ===,3184840
Berliner would then submerse the recorded disc in an acid bath to create deeper grooves.,3,11,== Biography == | === Consolidated Talking Machine Company ===,3184840
