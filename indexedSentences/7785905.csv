"Aulin's work consists of two types of work, piano compositions and compositions for voice and piano, that both provide works for less experienced musicians and professional musicians.",0,5,== Compositions ==,7785905

"With the exception of Grande sonate sérieuse pour le piano [F minor], Sonata for piano opus 14, the piano compositions have a single movement.",2,5,== Compositions ==,7785905
These compositions are mood pieces in which the title already defines the pieces character.,3,5,== Compositions ==,7785905
The prominence of single movement works is puzzling as Aulin was an accomplished pianist and was more than capable of playing longer compositions.,4,5,== Compositions ==,7785905

Aulin's compositions for solo voice and piano tend to be artistic songs rather than romances.,6,5,== Compositions ==,7785905
