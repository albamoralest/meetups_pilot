C.F. Theodore Steinway was one of the most innovative inventors and patent holders in the history of the piano: more than 45 patents originate from his development work.,0,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"The most important development is considered to be the single key mechanism fitted to the newly invented tubular frame built with tubes of brass which contain wooden sticks inside to allow accuracy and a simple screwing, patent gained 1871 for Steinway.",1,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"Since the Vienna mechanism disappeared at the beginning of the 20th century, all grand pianos have been built using the single key principle, mainly developed by C.F. Theodore Steinway and his younger brothers.",2,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
With this system it is possible to replace the hammer and also the wippen of a single defective key without either disturbing the neighbouring keys or disassembling any non-defective elements.,3,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
Also the reinstallation of the elements is supported with high accuracy on the one hand and on the other a quite simple adjustment to perfect working conditions.,4,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"The precise bearing of the hammer and the whippen on specially profiled brass tubes is still today one of the core elements of Steinway's grand piano mechanism and has not been modified since 1871: a new hammer fits on a tubular fixture of 1871, and vice versa.",5,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
Theodore's key innovation was the use of a stiff metal fixture with wooden sticks inserted.,6,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
These permit the continuation of the old and trusted use of wood screws – but provide much higher precision and stability.,7,10,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"The next most important innovation was C.F. Theodore Steinway's rim bending block patent of 1880, which is still used in every grand piano all over the world: long thin strips of sawn wood are glued together and clamped on a wing-shaped fixture with screwed pressing bars.",0,11,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
The previous method of casemaking for grands was much more expensive and time-consuming: it demanded the fitting together of wooden corner pieces and in particular the right-hand wall bent by steam into an S curve.,1,11,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"The steam bending process required very experienced workers, and a high proportion of the bent pieces had to be rejected.",2,11,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"So C.F. Theodore Steinway's invention, which glued together thin saw-cut sheets was very economical: it permitted more cases to be made in a shorter time, with less loss of wood which had already been expensively dried over a period of years.",3,11,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"C.F. Theodore Steinway was the European correspondent in the frequent exchange of letters, and later telegrams, between the Steinway brothers on either side of the Atlantic.",0,12,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"This exchange of ideas for better, cheaper and more reliable piano manufacturing led to the final phase of the development of the piano between 1860 and 1885 and a large number of US patents.",1,12,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"With the letters and sketches from C.F. Theodore Steinway in Germany, the younger brothers often applied to the US patent office and obtained protection for these ideas.",2,12,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
"Several further patents, which are not directly connected with C.F. Theodore Steinway's name, nevertheless originate from his work and ideas.",3,12,== Influence on piano development ==,28809823
