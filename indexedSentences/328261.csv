"In his instructional video for example he mentioned that he often played altered scales that are unusual to the average player, such as F minor major 7th with a raised 4th, while also displaying an ability to recognize such complex scales in chord form with voicings up and down the neck, with each note being a member of a family.",6,21,== Compositions and style ==,328261

"One of the reasons for his renowned emphasis on legato, as opposed to picking, stemmed from a desire to make the sound between picked and legato notes indistinguishable.",1,22,== Compositions and style ==,328261
"Another of his most identifiable traits was the use of rich, fingerpicked chords (often awash with delay, chorus and other complex effects), which were articulated and sustained using volume swells to create sounds reminiscent of the horn and saxophone.",2,22,== Compositions and style ==,328261
"He said that he preferred both of these instruments to the guitar, the latter of which was not his first choice of instrument upon receiving one from his father when beginning to play music.",3,22,== Compositions and style ==,328261

"Furthermore, he was influenced greatly by such saxophonists as John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Michael Brecker and Charlie Parker, while some of his favourite guitarists were Django Reinhardt, Joe Pass, Wes Montgomery, Jimmy Raney, Charlie Christian and Hank Marvin.",5,22,== Compositions and style ==,328261

"Guthrie Govan has said of guitarists who aspire to play like Holdsworth: ""I think it's potentially dangerous when a rock type player hears a bit of Allan Holdsworth or Frank Gambale and then dives straight into that style of playing; not only is the technical aspect daunting, there's also all that musical knowledge and understanding going on behind the scenes, and it's really hard to absorb both of those aspects at once without your playing just starting to sound worse.",7,24,== Influence and reception ==,328261

"This is also a technique by which Holdsworth was inspired by saxophonists, with large scoops in and out of phrases causing a jointed and smooth saxophone-like sound, without the need of a fretless guitar.",6,27,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
With this revelation it is thought he abandoned the idea of the fretless guitar.,7,27,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"In 1984, Holdsworth developed his first signature guitars with Ibanez, known as the AH-10 and AH-20.",0,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"These instruments have a semi-hollow body made from basswood with a hollow cavity underneath the pickguard, and can be heard on Metal Fatigue and Atavachron.",1,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"He also developed a signature guitar with Charvel called the ""Charvel Holdsworth Original"" which he played in the 1980s.",2,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"His long association with Steinberger guitars began in 1987: these are made from graphite and carbon fibre, and distinctively have no headstock.",3,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"With designer Ned Steinberger, he developed the GL2TA-AH signature model.",4,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"He started playing customised headless guitars made by luthier Bill DeLap in the 1990s, which included an extended-range baritone model with a 38-inch scale length.",5,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"However, he later said that he only owned one of the latter instruments (with a 34-inch scale).",6,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"He also developed a line of signature guitars with Carvin Guitars, including the semi-hollow H2 in 1996, the completely hollow HF2 Fatboy in 1999, and the headless HH1 and HH2 models in 2013.",7,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"On Atavachron, Holdsworth first recorded with the SynthAxe—a fretted, guitar-like MIDI controller with keys, string triggers, and an additional tube-like input device named 'Masters Touch' (designed by Nyle Steiner, inventor of the EWI) which dynamically alters volume and tone using breath velocity.",8,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"Sound-wise, he used patches that were mainly Oberheim synthesizers.",9,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261
"He used the SynthAxe on all solo releases from Atavachron onwards, but later said he no longer wanted it as such an integral part of his playing—especially live—mainly because of it being so rare (fewer than 100 units still exist), and difficult to maintain and repair as a result.",10,28,== Equipment == | === Guitars ===,328261

"He liked the Marshalls for single-note soloing, but not for chords because of the resulting distortion.",5,30,== Equipment == | === Amplifiers ===,328261
"He also experimented with a couple of Norlin Lab Series L5, which he found too clean.",6,30,== Equipment == | === Amplifiers ===,328261

"In his later career he transitioned to Hartley-Thompson amps, which in his opinion had a warm and clean sound.",0,32,== Equipment == | === Amplifiers ===,328261

Holdsworth could also be seen performing with Yamaha DG80 112 digital modelling amps that he used in pairs: one for his clean sound and the other had a 'crunch' preset with very little gain and a lot of master volume.,2,32,== Equipment == | === Amplifiers ===,328261
