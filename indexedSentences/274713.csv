"As he was then unable to play guitar ,the rest of his tour was cancelled.",9,10,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"His follow-up album, Perilous Journey, consolidated his success, being named one of the best albums of 1977 by The Sunday Times.",0,11,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
It peaked in the UK Albums Chart at No. 29.,1,11,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"A single taken from the album, ""Heartsong"", received extensive airplay and reached No. 21 in the UK Singles Chart.",2,11,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713

"Giltrap later said of the track's creation, ""It began with a song I did in the late '60s called 'Starting All Over'.",2,12,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
When I lived in London I began to mess around with it and stumbled on the riff for what would become 'Heartsong'.,3,12,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"I kept working on it, and eventually recorded the guitar part for it.",4,12,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Then we added the rhythm section from Simon Phillips (drums) and John G. Perry (bass).""",5,12,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"""At the time I never thought of this as anything other than a jolly little tune, but my producers Rod Edwards and Roger Hand realized the commercial potential in what we had.",0,13,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"The melody really came out when the mini moog part was added, and then Eddie Spence (keyboards) came up with the fast moving synth figure.",1,13,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Edwards and Hand recorded Eddie at half speed, then played it back at normal speed to get the desired effect.",2,13,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713

"Whilst Visionary had evolved from acoustic compositions adapted for a bigger band, Perilous Journey was composed with a bigger band sound in mind.",0,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
It appeared occasionally to be more keyboard dominated but Giltrap was unperturbed by this as the pieces were his own compositions and he was pleased with the arrangements which he had worked on with Rod Edwards and Roger Hand.,1,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
In those days albums had to flow from artists at consistent rates and few acts dared to allow time for the public to forget them.,2,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Such was the case with Giltrap who released his next album, Fear of the Dark, in 1978.",3,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"At this stage, after the success of his previous two albums, Giltrap was riding on a high.",4,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
Material for Fear of the Dark was relatively swiftly assembled.,5,14,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"The title track, in shortened form, was released as a single but failed to achieve the success of ""Heartsong"".",0,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
It reached number 48 in the singles charts and the band appeared on Top of the Pops.,1,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Another song on the album, ""Fast Approaching"", was a reworked track, vastly different from the original which had appeared on Giltrap's first album.",2,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
It was extended to five minutes and featured Giltrap on both acoustic and electric guitars.,3,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
He was now becoming far more familiar with the latter instrument and at this stage really enjoyed playing his Gibson Les Paul.,4,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
Giltrap's electric guitar playing is a feature on this album but he was always first and foremost an acoustic guitarist and before too long the electric guitar featured less and less in his work.,5,15,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"In 1979 Giltrap toured the 'Fear of the Dark' album with a band that consisted of the late John Gustafson on bass, a legend of the early Mersey Scene, and a top session player, Ian Mosely on drums who went on to work with Steve Hackett and latterly became a full time member of Marillion.",0,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Old stalwarts, Rod Edwards and Eddy Spence, shared keyboard duties.",1,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Singer, Shirlie Roden, made a guest appearance on 'Innerdream'.",2,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
One of the dates on the tour was at the Oxford Polytechnic where the subsequent 'Live at Oxford' album was recorded.,3,16,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
By this stage in Giltrap's career he was beginning to be concerned about becoming too predictable.,0,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
He decided to move away from playing with a band and move back towards solo work.,1,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"Giltrap's next album 'The Peacock Party' which was released in 1979, was inspired by a book of the same name.",2,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
This was in part illustrated by Alan Aldridge who also painted the colourful cover of the Giltrap album.,3,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
A previous book entitled 'The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast' had inspired an album by Roger Glover of Deep Purple which featured a host of stars.,4,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
The Triumvirate team had also been working on an album inspired by the book featuring the voices of Judi Dench and Michael Hordern and it also featured celebrated musicians including Gerry Conway and Bruce Lynch both of whom had previously worked extensively with Cat Stevens.,5,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
Aldridge appeared to prefer Triumvirates's version and it was he who brought his next book 'The Peacock Party'  to the Triumvirate team to see if they were interested in another project.,6,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
Triumvirate felt this was a good project for Giltrap to pursue.,7,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
Giltrap's pieces on this album are less complicated but still feature a full band sound.,8,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
The whole feel of the album is more upbeat than his previous three.,9,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"The tracks are shorter in length and, ironically, feature Giltrap playing more electric guitar than previous albums.",10,17,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"As previously mentioned, Giltrap had decided at this stage to move away from more commercial music and concentrate solely upon self-penned intricate guitar pieces.",0,18,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"However, whilst working on 'The Peacock Party' he decided to retain the big band sound and incorporated many musicians within his pieces with whom he felt comfortable working.",1,18,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"For example, the album featured the first of Giltrap's several collaborations with violinist Ric Sanders of Fairport Convention and John Etheridge of Soft Machine also features.",2,18,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"This album showcases a wide range of Giltrap's talents from his strident electric guitar work on the opening track, 'Headwind' to the intricacy of second acoustic track 'Magpie Rag'.",0,19,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"This track incorporates a complex, oft-repeated riff around which the whole piece is based.",1,19,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"The final track, ""Dodo's Dream"" has become a standard feature of his live performances in which he uses a looper and overdubbing to build up the piece.",2,19,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
When he finished recording he embarked on a small tour in his favoured trio format which featured Ric Sanders on violin and long-term ally Eddie Spence on keyboards.,0,20,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"This diversion concluded at a tricky time in his life when his first marriage broke up and his mother, with whom he was very close, passed away having contracted cancer at age 58.",1,20,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
"The tour to promote the album comprised Giltrap, Clive Bunker on drums, Rod Edwards on keyboards and 'Bimbo' Acock on saxophone, flute and additional keyboards.",2,20,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713
The tour was a success and boosted Giltrap at a time when he was feeling really low.,3,20,== Career == | === 1970s ===,274713

"Giltrap's next album, Airwaves, released in 1981, evolved from the lineup of the band with whom Giltrap was performing.",0,22,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
This was a different album to any previously produced as Giltrap did not compose every piece.,1,22,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"Initially planned as music for TV, radio, film or other non-commercial use the recordings gradually morphed into an album which was eventually released.",2,22,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
It didn't sell as well as previous Giltrap recordings and Giltrap himself felt somewhat detached from it as he was going through a difficult time in his life.,3,22,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
There were to be no more Giltrap albums released for five years.,4,22,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"Performing gigs, however, did not stop as income still needed to be earned and Giltrap was pleased that he had learnt his craft as a solo performer thus not requiring the backing of a large band.",0,23,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
During this time he honed his skills of engaging with an audience.,1,23,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"Giltrap's life during this time went through a turbulent stage with the loss of his father at age 66, the fact he had two children to bring up and meeting his future wife, Hilary.",2,23,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
He gradually began to get his life back to some sort of order.,3,23,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"He was also gigging through this entire time and had joined up with Ric Sanders, currently best known as the violinist of Fairport Convention.",4,23,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
Ric had already appeared as a guest on Giltrap's' album Peacock Party.,5,23,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"The title track, the longest on the album, was based upon a poem written by Elizabeth Barker, Giltrap's mother in law.",0,24,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
Giltrap found the poem emotionally moving.,1,24,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
On this track the sound effects generated by the electric guitar are much in evidence.,2,24,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"""Sallie's Song"" was inspired by a commission Giltrap had for the TV series Hold the Back Page starring David Warner and directed by Adrian Shergold.",0,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
Shergold subsequently commissioned Giltrap to write music for several others of his productions.,1,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
These compositions were never released on album because Giltrap felt they were too intrinsically linked to the plot of the films to work as stand-alone pieces.,2,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"Later in 1987, Giltrap released A Midnight Clear, featuring instrumental renditions of well-known and lesser-known Christmas carols.",3,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
Giltrap enlisted the support of Ric Sanders and his old friend Bimbo Acock.,4,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"The resultant album, whilst not hugely commercial, became quite popular.",5,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"The following year Giltrap began gigging with Ric and, because they were such a successful pairing, they began working on an album together.",6,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
"Entitled One to One, it was released in 1989.",7,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
Both artists felt differently about it but both accept there was an instrumental imbalance which could be substantially improved with a remix.,8,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713
The remix never happened and the album remains rather violin top heavy.,9,25,== Career == | === 1980s ===,274713

"In 1992 Giltrap performed at the Warwick Folk Festival when he performed, arguably, his finest live session.",0,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
Unbeknownst to Giltrap this was recorded and later released as an album.,1,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"It was this album which caught the attention of Ritchie Blackmore, who had become a self-professed admirer of Giltrap's work.1993 brought with it the fulfillment of a project which Giltrap had contemplated for some time.",2,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"He had a vision of re-recording ""Heartsong"" with many of his well-known friends.",3,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"These friends were Brian May, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, Midge Ure and Neil Murray.",4,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"When completed, despite the quality of the recording, there was surprisingly little interest from record companies and it was two years before the track surfaced on an album.",5,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
Later that year Giltrap joined Midge Ure on his Out Alone solo tour.,6,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"Giltrap co-wrote a song with him entitled ""Feel So Good"" which was eventually released on the 2001 album Little Orphans.",7,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"He also undertook a tour with a guitarist he greatly admired, Albert Lee, along with his band Hogan's Heroes.",8,27,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
1994 saw him on tour with ELO Part II.,0,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"ELO were performing without their front man, Jeff Lynne.",1,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
Giltrap was disappointed that his name did not appear on any advertising poster nor was he actually remunerated for his performances.,2,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"These were, however, very well received and resulted in good CD sales.",3,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"Giltrap had used a Fylde guitar on ""Heartsong'""which had been greatly admired by Cliff Richard.",4,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
This guitar is the one he played on BBC's Top of the Pops.,5,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"Whilst interviewing many celebrities for Guitarist magazine, Giltrap met Cliff Richard for the first time since the 1970s when he had originally loaned Cliff the Fylde.",6,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
It had an intricately designed inlay of the 'Tree of Life' on the fretboard and Cliff loved it.,7,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
Giltrap decided to present it to him as a gift.,8,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
In 1995 Giltrap released the album Music for the Small Screen.,9,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
In past years he had been employed to compose several theme tunes for various television programmes following the success of 'Heartsong' on BBC's Holiday programme.,10,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
Not many of these pieces had appeared on his albums.,11,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"The album featured the all-star reworking of 'Heartsong' and also a track entitled 'Last of England', later to be the title of a highly regarded album, which had been used in the Adrian Shergold drama Will You Love Me Tomorrow.",12,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
This play was loosely based on the child killer Mary Bell and featured Giltrap in a cameo role as a newspaper seller strumming a guitar.,13,28,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"This album also featured a track entitled ""The Lord's Seat"" which had been written for a television documentary.",0,29,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
It remains a staple of Giltrap's gigs to this day.,1,29,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
"The track was written in a Renaissance style and required a special, lute-like baby guitar made by luthier Rob Armstrong.",2,29,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713

"Giltrap's next album, Troubadour, was named after his character in Heathcliff. '",0,31,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713
Troubadour' gave Giltrap the chance to approach his old friend Del Newman to work on the string arrangements for the album.,1,31,== Career == | === 1990s ===,274713

"For some time, Giltrap had been considering creating a tribute album to Bert Jansch whom he greatly admired.",0,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
The result was a short album comprising six pieces.,1,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
One of these tracks required vocals which Giltrap himself performed.,2,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The track, entitled 'Running From Home', was the first time Giltrap had sung on an album in 17 years.",3,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"During this album Giltrap attempted to demonstrate Jansch's great versatility of skills in the selection of pieces he chose for the album, performing each in Janch's unique style.",4,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"This is amply demonstrated by Ewan MacColl's 'The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face', a track which Jansch had played in his unique style and which Giltrap followed faithfully in his interpretation of the song.",5,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Another notable track on the album was another piece previously interpreted by Jansch: Davey Graham's 'Anji'.,6,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713

"The album concluded with a version of ""Roots"", Giltrap's own composition which had first appeared on his 'Fear of the Dark' album.",8,36,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713

"Giltrap decided to include his version of George Harrison's ""Here Comes the Sun"".",0,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"He used a baby Armstrong guitar for this piece and, although he never met George Harrison, he was indirectly the person who introduced him to that guitar.",1,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"This happened via his friend, Joe Brown, who was so impressed with the instrument when Giltrap demonstrated it to him, that he sent one to Harrison as a Christmas present.",2,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Harrison loved it too and purchased two more as gifts for his close friends.,3,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Another track revisited on this album was the Troubadour piece ""The Picnic"".",4,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
This piece became enlivened by Ashe-Roy's skills on the flute and Giltrap was delighted with the result.,5,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The flautist's skills were also in evidence on another track, ""Crossing the Border"", on which the duo were joined by a second guitarist, Kevin Dempsey, with whom Giltrap had toured as a duo several years earlier.",6,38,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713

Two of Giltrap’s original tracks featured accompaniment by Rick Wakeman as these had previously been recorded for a radio programme.,1,40,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
In 2001 Giltrap met the classical guitarist Raymond Burley.,0,41,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Burley listened to Giltrap‘s work and, liking what he heard, realised that they might be able to make music together.",1,41,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"This resulted in a collaborative album called Double Vision, which was released in 1982.",2,41,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The album was recorded live at Holy Trinity church in Weston, East Hampshire.",3,41,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
This was the beginning of a collaboration between the two friends which would last several years.,4,41,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713

This violin Giltrap had picked up at a boot fair for £20.,4,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
He asked somebody to look at it to see if it was any good.,5,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"It turned out to be a violin made by Giuseppe Pedrazzini who was a celebrated early 20th century violin maker, and was worth £30,000, This instrument was used on three tracks on the album.",6,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Giltrap eventually parted with the violin for £23,000.",7,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The violin features on the opening track of the album, ""Mrs Singer's Waltz"".",8,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"This is followed by another track, a regular piece in Giltrap's current live performances, entitled ""Maddie Goes West"".",9,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"It features banjo player Madelyn Martyn who was just about to take a trip to America, hence the title.",10,42,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The title track, ""Drifter"", was, interestingly, also recorded on another guitar purchased cheaply at a boot fair.",0,43,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Giltrap's wife, Hilary, helped out with the vocals on this track.",1,43,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Giltrap had previously received a call from somebody who worked for music publishing company wondering if he could write a piece in the style of Django Reinhardt.,0,44,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Giltrap duly created a piece entitled ""Deco Echo"".",1,44,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
This piece was later to be used on television program about the Poirot series which starred David Suchet.,2,44,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
The album had a sleeve with the lone silhouetted figure of Giltrap looking like a drifter.,0,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
The photo had been taken by his wife Hilary and they were both delighted with it particularly when they realised that it suited the title of the album perfectly.,1,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
No further original Giltrap albums were to be forthcoming for several years but in 2006 a concert at the Symphony Hall Birmingham was filmed.,2,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
In 2007 Giltrap released the album Secret Valentine.,3,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
This album re-visited some of his favourite romantic pieces.,4,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
It was basically created to feature the sound of a Rob Armstrong guitar which had been designed as part of a research project and was made entirely out of a plastic polymer.,5,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Giltrap released this and amply demonstrated the versatility of that instrument.,6,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"A live album, As It Happens..., was released later in 2007, with which Giltrap himself was very pleased.",7,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
The following year saw the launch of a venture entitled Three Parts Guitar.,8,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Double Vision had not been as successful as hoped due to a perceived clash in styles between Burley and Giltrap.,9,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The pair, however, convinced their collaboration had a future, enlisted the talented jazz-based guitarist John Etheridge to join them in a tour.",10,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
This proved extremely successful.,11,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"In concert, they each played a solo session before the finale where they joined together to play some of Gordon's pieces.",12,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
The show in the Symphony Hall in Birmingham in September 2008 was performed to capacity crowd with special guest Rick Wakeman.,13,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
John Etheridge could not totally commit to the tour as he was also working with classical guitar star John Williams.,14,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Clive Carrol was approached to see if he would step in if required.,15,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Having seen Carrol play guitar Festival, it was John Renbourn who recommended him.",16,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Giltrap too was also hugely impressed with his talent.,17,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Etheridge, however, then committed to the project and Carrol was asked to join the group which then became Four Parts Guitar, thus forming a collaboration which worked well for several more years.",18,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
For some time Giltrap and Rick Wakeman had been planning to make an album together.,19,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
They decided that the time had now arrived.,20,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
Giltrap's love of Renaissance art contrasting with Wakeman‘s love of sculpture resulted in the album's title From Brush and Stone.,21,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"The album, divided in two by composer, featured tracks with each adding accompaniment to each other's compositions.",22,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"Giltrap's pieces were mainly a reworking of his Brotherhood Suite and these were complemented by versions of the aforementioned ""Maddie Goes West"" and a piece entitled ""By Angle Tarn"".",23,45,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
The duo's collaboration continued when Wakeman undertook a solo tour entitled Grumpy Old Picture Show.,0,46,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
"It included a previously recorded video conversation with Giltrap, which was worked so that Wakeman appeared to be conversing live with Giltrap on stage.",1,46,== Career == | === 2000s ===,274713
=== 2010s,0,47,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713

"The flautist Hilary Ash-Roy appears once again on ""Joy Ride"" and ""Prayer for Philippa"".",2,48,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"Another track, ""Forever Gold"", was written to celebrate Cliff Richard's 50 years in show business.",3,48,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
Several older compositions are revisited on the album.,4,48,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713

"Another, ""The Passing Of A Queen"", had originally appeared on the 1973 Giltrap album.",6,48,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"Shining Morn also features a new version of ""Dodo's Dream"", which had become a staple of Giltrap’s concerts.",7,48,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
This version with overdubbing tries to replicate the feeling given during live performances of the piece.,8,48,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"In 2012 Giltrap, reflecting upon the work he had done since Elegy, decided to change tack and produce a completely different type of album.",0,49,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"To this end, he teamed up with Oliver Wakeman, one of Rick's sons, who had recently departed from the band",1,49,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
Yes.,2,49,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"The pair of them produced together the prog rock album Ravens and Lullabies, which was released the following year.",3,49,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
Giltrap decided that this collaboration was to involve both their writing skills.,0,50,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"Wakeman arranged Esoteric as the record label, found recording studios and located a suitable vocalist in the form of Paul Manzi.",1,50,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
This album reacquainted Giltrap with the electric guitar.,0,51,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"Despite on many previous occasions revealing considerable skills with this instrument, he still lacked faith in his own abilities.",1,51,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"However, the results he achieved even surprised himself.",2,51,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"The track ""From the Turn of a Card"" featured the vocals of Benoit David with whom Wakeman had worked during his time with the band",3,51,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
Yes.,4,51,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
The album was well received and sold well.,5,51,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
The album was supported by a tour complete with a full band.,0,52,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
Giltrap felt uncomfortable attempting to play all the necessary guitar parts himself which would have involved frequent changes of instrument.,1,52,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"For this reason, they drafted in guitarist Nick Kendall.",2,52,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"The band headlined the Summer's End prog rock festival to great acclaim and, their live show proved to be an enormous success.",3,52,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713

"He was referred eventually to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham,.",11,52,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
Surgery took place on 6 May 2016 and was considerably more invasive than they had hoped it would be.,0,53,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"During this time he was supported by his friend, singer / songwriter Carrie Martin, who helped both himself and Hilary through a very traumatic period of their lives.",1,53,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"After surgery, which was to prove to be twice as long as expected, Giltrap was very weak and there initially was concern for his future.",2,53,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"However, he gradually regained his strength, returning home just a fortnight later.",3,53,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713

"This would prove to be another collaboration, this time with keyboard player / arranger Paul Ward.",1,54,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"One of Giltrap's main targets on this album was to finally do justice to his ""Brotherhood Suite"".",2,54,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"Giltrap recorded all his contributions at home and, once completed, sent them to Ward to add keyboards and arrange the pieces.",3,54,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"They were both delighted with the resultant pieces, and Giltrap believed them to be amongst the best work he had ever produced.",4,54,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
The album was released in 2015 to critical acclaim.,5,54,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713

Whilst Giltrap continued gigging he also began to run workshops teaching his guitar pieces to groups of students.,2,55,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
"These events have proved popular and have became regular, most, recently, taking place at a large scout hall near his home in Sutton Coldfield.",3,55,== Career == | === 2010s ===,274713
