"Nightnoise gave Mícheál the opportunity to expand his musical vocabulary as well as his audience, while retaining the spirit of Irish traditional music that was so much a part of him.",11,20,== Nightnoise ==,5905280
"In an interview with Echoes, Ó Domhnaill spoke of the prevailing influence of his Irish heritage in the new music he was creating:",12,20,== Nightnoise ==,5905280
"We were pretty handcuffed and anchored by the tradition so we could still write music outside of the strictures of 6/8 time or 4/4 time, but they couldn't but sound Celtic because I'm Irish and whatever I write would have elements of the sum total of the listener experience I've had throughout my life.",0,21,== Nightnoise ==,5905280
"So the Celtic music is still there, the structure of the music is just different.",1,21,== Nightnoise ==,5905280
