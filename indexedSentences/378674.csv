"Described as a ""stage-action""—Nono explicitly forbade the title of ""opera""—it utilizes an array of resources from large orchestra, chorus, tape, and loudspeakers to the ""magic lantern"" technique drawn from Meyerhold and Mayakovsky theatre practices of the 1920s to form a rich expressionist drama.",2,18,== Biography == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,378674
"Angelo Ripellino's libretto consisting of political slogans, poems, and quotations from Brecht and Sartre (including moments of Brechtian alienation), together with Nono's strident, anguished music, fully accords with the anti-capitalist fulmination the composer intended to communicate.",3,18,== Biography == | === 1960s and 1970s ===,378674
