His contribution to I'll Take My Stand is his essay Reconstructed but Unregenerate which starts the book and lays out the Southern Agrarians' basic argument.,11,4,== Career ==,297308
"In various essays influenced by his Agrarian beliefs, Ransom defended the manifesto's assertion that modern industrial capitalism was a dehumanizing force that the South should reject in favor of an agrarian economic model.",12,4,== Career ==,297308
"However, by the late 1930s he began to distance himself from the movement, and in 1945, he publicly criticized it.",13,4,== Career ==,297308

"In 1963, the poet/critic and former Ransom student Randall Jarrell published an essay in which he highly praised Ransom's poetry:  In John Crowe Ransom's best poems every part is subordinated to the whole, and the whole is accomplished with astonishing exactness and thoroughness.",4,6,== Career ==,297308
"Their economy, precision, and restraint gives the poems, sometimes, an original yet impersonal perfection . . .",5,6,== Career ==,297308
"And sometimes their phrasing is magical—light as air, soft as dew, the real old-fashioned enchantment.",6,6,== Career ==,297308
"The poems satisfy our nostalgia for the past, yet themselves have none.",7,6,== Career ==,297308
They are reports . . .,8,6,== Career ==,297308
"of our world's old war between power and love, between those who efficiently and practically know and those who are ""content to feel/ What others understand.""",9,6,== Career ==,297308
"And these reports of battles are, somehow, bewitching . . .",10,6,== Career ==,297308
"Ransom's poems profess their limitations so candidly, almost as a principle of style, that it is hardly necessary to say they are not poems of the largest scope or the greatest intensity.",11,6,== Career ==,297308
"But they are some of the most original poems ever written, just as Ransom is one of the best, most original, and most sympathetic poets alive; it is easy to see that his poetry will always be cared for, since he has written poems that are perfectly realized and occasionally almost perfect.""",12,6,== Career ==,297308

He also occasionally employed archaic diction.,18,6,== Career ==,297308
"Ellman and O'Clair note that ""[Ransom] defends formalism because he sees in it a check on bluntness, on brutality.",19,6,== Career ==,297308

"He was a leading figure of the school of literary criticism known as the New Criticism, which gained its name from his 1941 volume of essays The New Criticism.",0,7,== Career ==,297308
"The New Critical theory, which dominated American literary thought throughout the middle 20th century, emphasized close reading, and criticism based on the texts themselves rather than on non-textual bias or non-textual history.",1,7,== Career ==,297308
"In his seminal 1937 essay, ""Criticism, Inc."" Ransom laid out his ideal form of literary criticism stating that, ""criticism  must become more scientific, or precise and systematic.""",2,7,== Career ==,297308
"To this end, he argued that personal responses to literature, historical scholarship, linguistic scholarship, and what he termed ""moral studies"" should not influence literary criticism.",3,7,== Career ==,297308
He also argued that literary critics should regard a poem as an aesthetic object.,4,7,== Career ==,297308
Many of the ideas he explained in this essay would become very important in the development of The New Criticism.,5,7,== Career ==,297308
"""Criticism, Inc."" and a number of Ransom's other theoretical essays set forth some of the guiding principles that the New Critics would build upon.",6,7,== Career ==,297308
