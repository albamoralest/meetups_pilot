"Vasyl Oleksandrovych Barvinsky (Ukrainian: Василь Олександрович Барвінський) (20 February 1888 – 9 June 1963) was a Ukrainian composer, pianist, conductor, teacher, musicologist, and music related social figure. Barvinsky was one of the first Ukrainian composers to gain worldwide recognition.  His pieces were published not only in the Soviet Union, but also in Vienna, Leipzig, New York (Universal Edition), and Japan. Barvinsky directed a post-secondary musical institution in the city of Lviv (1915-1948) the Lysenko Higher Institute of Music, and was considered to be the head of musical life at the time. Currently there is a College of Music named after Barvinsky in Drohobych city of Ukraine.

"Vasyl Barvinsky was born in Ternopil, on 20 February 1888. Barvinsky descended from an older aristocratic family. Barvinsky's father, Oleksander Barvinsky, was famous Russian pedagogue, politician, and public figure. In 1917 he was appointed a member of the Austrian upper chamber. Vasyl's mother, singer and pianist, became his first music teacher. In 1939 he founded Lviv Secondary Specialized Music Boarding School named after Solomiya Krushelnytska. In 1948 Barvinsky was denounced and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. His works were suppressed. After his release and rehabilitation in 1958 he attempted to reconstruct works that had been destroyed by the authorities but many of the lost works were not rediscovered until after his death in 1963.
