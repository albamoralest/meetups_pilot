"Born in Montreal, Quebec, Doucette's family moved to Hamilton, Ontario, when he was four. He received his first guitar when he was six. Doucette joined numerous bands prior to his solo career, starting with The Reefers, at the age of 11. He migrated to Toronto, Ontario, and played in the final incarnation of Brutus. Doucette moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1972 and joined the Seeds of Time, and worked with Lindsay Mitchell and Rocket Norton, both of whom later joined Prism, and Alexis Radlin. After the Seeds of Time, Doucette joined Rocket Norton in The Rocket Norton Band along with Rick Enns and John Hall. He contributed one song on the band's first single, titled Donkey Chain. He subsequently signed a solo recording deal with Mushroom Records, and commenced recording under his surname only.

"""Mama Let Him Play"", the single from the first Doucette album release of the same name in the fall of 1977, earned platinum status (sales of 100,000 units) in Canada, plus substantial publicity and tour promotion.  The single and record were not successful to the same degree in the United States, though the single charted in the Billboard Top 100 and the album in the Billboard 200. The recording band for the single and album was composed of Duris Maxwell on drums, Brent Shindell on guitar, Don Cummings on bass and Robbie King on keyboards. The following year's release, The Douce is Loose, was less successful, although it earned gold status (50,000 units sold) in Canada, and produced the popular single ""Nobody"" co-written with Maxwell.

"Mushroom Records eventually succumbed to financial problems, leaving Doucette to find a new label for his third album, Coming up Roses. This, plus the emergence of new wave music, were blamed for Doucette's lack of follow-up success in the music industry.

"Both of Doucette's Mushroom Records albums, Mama Let Him Play and The Douce Is Loose, were re-released on compact disc and digital formats for the first time in 2013 through Hamilton, Ontario-based independent record label Linus Entertainment.
