"In mid- to late-2004 Dallas re-emerged with a new band, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster. They released an album, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster on October 25, 2005, and signed with Mono Vs Stereo. After the release, Maylene and the Sons of Disaster signed to Ferret Records. Dallas has been quoted as saying, ""I am so fed up with people acting like cowards, and so tired of the many things I've lived for in the past. I feel like it's time to get back to where I was when I was young.  This band is proud of who we are as people, what we believe, and where we come from. I feel like so much of music today, especially those who come from a Christian background, spend so much time hiding who they really are, or being ashamed of their beliefs, trying to be 'scene' or to sell records.  I want every kid to know I am not going to change who I really am to sell records. I mean, I absolutely hate shoving things down people's throats, but hiding who you are is just as bad.""Dallas was part of a two-person piano-based side project, The Everett, with his long-time friend Patrick Copeland from The Glorious Unseen. The Everett recorded a four song EP, Destination, that is no longer available.
