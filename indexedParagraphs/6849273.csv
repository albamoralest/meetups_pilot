"Jel is primarily a producer. He is known for his use of SP-1200 and MPC2000XL to create drum beats with little or no sequencing like playing the drums live via the sampler pads. He has produced numerous tracks for underground hip hop artists such as Deep Puddle Dynamics, Atmosphere, Sole, Sage Francis, and Serengeti. Jel is also a rapper. He provided vocals on Soft Money and Late Pass. In a 2006 interview with The Skinny, he said: ""What inspires me lyrically is television conversations and dope MCs.""
