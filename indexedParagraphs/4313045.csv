"Resto's career in recorded music began in the early 1980s in Detroit, with Michael Henderson and Was (Not Was). He continued playing keyboards and co-writing songs for a wide variety of artists (including many produced by Don Was), ranging from Anita Baker to Patti Smith to The Highwaymen to Vertical Horizon to Fuel, before beginning a prolific and lengthy collaboration with Eminem in 2001. He has played the keyboard for several Eminem-produced tracks and is credited for additional production on most Eminem-produced tracks on Encore. Resto released his own solo LP titled ""Combo De Momento"", and was released under his own imprint Resto World Music on May 18, 2010. He co-produced the Oscar-winning song, ""Lose Yourself"", featured in the movie 8 Mile with Jeff Bass and Eminem.
