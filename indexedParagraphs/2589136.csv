"In 2004, Matsuura was the subject of some controversy when he considered leaving Avex Music Group due to a feud with Tom Yoda. Many artists, including Ayumi Hamasaki, said that they would also move in the event that he did so. Thus, stocks for Avex Trax plunged and Yoda ended up resigning, ending the feud. In March 2009, Matsuura helped Tetsuya Komuro in the latter's fraud case. Matsuura paid the plaintiff ¥648,000,000 (¥500,000,000 for the exact amount, ¥100,000,000 for compensations and ¥48,000,000 for delay damages).
