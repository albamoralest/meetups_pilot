"While she was dating Thee Headcoats' drummer Bruce Brand she had an impromptu singing performance with his band. Billy Childish, founder of the Headcoats, added her to the line up of The Delmonas and changed the name to Thee Headcoatees. Thee Headcoatees were primarily a garage band that backed up the Thee Headcoats. In 1995 she started her solo career but continued to be an active member of Thee Headcoatees until they disbanded in 1999. For her solo career, she draws from rhythm and blues, rockabilly, and sounds of the 1960s or earlier. She has released 13 albums of her own and has collaborated with other musicians, such as Billy Childish, Rocket from the Crypt and The White Stripes. She performed two songs on the soundtrack of the film Broken Flowers: ""There Is an End (featuring Holly Golightly)"" by The Greenhornes & Holly Golightly (which can also be found on the Greenhornes' album Dual Mono), and ""Tell Me Now So I Know"" by Holly Golightly (found on the album Truly She Is None Other), which is a song originally written by Ray Davies. She is a collector of rare old songs which she often covers.

"Golightly formed a duo in the mid-2000s, recording and touring extensively with her longtime bandmate Lawyer Dave. As Holly Golightly and The Brokeoffs, they released five albums and one EP between 2007 and 2012.  Their first album, You Can't Buy A Gun When You're Crying, is a reference to comedian Lord Carrett's joke ""I learned a lot from my second marriage... I learned they won't sell you a handgun if you're crying..."" Holly Golightly & The Brokeoffs were winners of the ninth annual Independent Music Awards for the best Americana album, Dirt Don't Hurt. In 2003, she sang with The White Stripes on the track ""It's True That We Love One Another"" on their fourth album, Elephant. Time Out New York described her as an ""English garage rock doyenne."" In 2012, they released Sunday Run Me Over, their first album recorded entirely at their home in rural Georgia.
