"Vito Lucente resided in Belgium in his teen years. In 1995, he abandoned Eurodance and adopted the name ""Mr. Jack"" (which would later morph into Junior Jack), dabbling in house music. He entered the UK Top 40 with the singles ""My Feeling"", ""Thrill Me (Such A Thrill)"", ""E Samba"", ""Dare Me (Stupidisco)"" and ""Da Hype"", the latter featuring vocals by Robert Smith from The Cure and uses samples from ""I'm So Hot For You"" by Bobby Orlando. His album Trust It was released to critical acclaim. ""My Feeling"" and ""Stupidisco"" were built around vocal samples from, respectively, ""Saturday Love"" by Alexander O'Neal and Cherrelle, and ""Dare Me"" by The Pointer Sisters. His latest single was a remake of ""Dare Me (Stupidisco)"", with vocals from Shena, which reached #20 in the UK Singles Chart on 25 February 2007
