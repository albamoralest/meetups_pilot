"He collaborated with S. Janaki for many films, including Edakallu Guddada Mele (""Sanyasi Sanyasi"") directed by Puttanna Kanagal. Ranga Rao composed memorable duets sung by Dr. Rajkumar and S. Janaki for ""Vasanta Geeta"", ""Hosabelaku"" and ""Samayada Gombe"".
",196,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === M. Ranga Rao ===
"For Hosabelaku, Ranga Rao composed a melodious tune for a poem by Rashtrakavi Kuvempu ""Teredide Mane O Baa Atithi"" and S. Janaki sung this along with another legendary singer Vani Jayaram.

"Ilaiyaraaja knew about Janaki's vocal range and versatility when he worked with G. K. Venkatesh. When he got a chance to compose music for his debut film Annakkili (1976) he made Janaki sing 3 songs which became immensely popular thus beginning an era in Tamil cinema. This combination churned out hits after hits pushing S Janaki to the numero uno position for at least the next 2 decades. S Janaki won 4 state awards in Tamil in his compositions. He explored her voice in wide variety of songs and she became the first choice for songs with village background.
",199,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Ilaiyaraaja ===
"She sang maximum duets with Balasubramanium, Malaysia Vasudevan, Mano, Yesudas, Jayachandran. Ilayaraaja himself sang around 200 duets with Janaki; most were chart busters. After IR started giving more songs to SJ, even other music composers followed by making her sing their top hits.
",200,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Ilaiyaraaja ===
"SPB-IR-SJ created some of the finest duets of Tamil cinemas. 1980s saw the meteoric rise of Janaki with a strong back up from Ilayaraja, as she sang his songs in all four South Indian languages.

"The earliest recognised collaboration of S Janaki's was with the Malayalam composer MS Baburaj, who specialised in Hindustani music. Under his direction, Janaki was able to give voice to some of Kerala's best loved film songs of all time during the 1960s and early 1970s. The songs they've worked on have been known for their outward expressions, both in voice and the composition by itself. Some of Janaki's best known solos come from this collaboration, including Vasantha Panchami Naalil (Bhargavi Nilayam), Anjana Kannezhuthi (Thacholi Othenan), and Thaane Thirinjum Marinjum (Ambalapravu).

"Rajan and Nagendra have a unique place in the hearts of Kannada music lovers.
",205,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Rajan–Nagendra ===
"S Janaki was a part of almost all their albums. During the initial days, RN gave many duets to PBS-SJ. Later their main singers were SPB and S Janaki.  Almost all of their songs remain etched as the unforgettable melodies of Kannada Cinema. The romantic duets that came out from the SPB-S Janaki-Rajan–Nagendra combination are considered to be heavenly and evergreen. Radios called the pair of SPB and S Janaki as ""Love Birds"" and are termed to be the ""Best singing pair"" in Kannada cinema, owing mainly to their romantic duets composed by Rajan–Nagendra in the 1970s and 80s
",206,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Rajan–Nagendra ===
"In terms of numbers, it was Rajan–Nagendra who gave maximum songs to Janaki after Ilaiyaraaja. 
",207,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Rajan–Nagendra ===
"The solos and duets that S Janaki rendered under these music composers can never be erased from the minds of the Kannada audience. Some top hit songs came from movies such as Eradu Kanasu, Hombisilu,  Gaali Maathu, Pavana Ganga, Avala Hejje, Chandana Gombe,  Naa Ninna Bidalare and the list continues.

"By the end of 80s Hamsalekha established himself as the top music composer in Kannada cinema pushing all the veteran composers to the background. His strong association with actor Ravichandran resulted in so many hit songs. S Janaki was his first choice during the initial days of his career. SPB-SJ-HL created some of the evergreen duets in movies like Premaloka and Ranadheera.
",210,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Hamsalekha ===
"S Janaki worked in more than 40 films with Hamsalekha and sang all-time hit solos and duets.

",212,== Collaboration with Music Directors == | === Vijaya Bhaskar ===
"Kannada cinema offered SJ real gems of her singing career and Vijaya Bhaskar is no exception. Though his main singers were P Susheela in 60s and Vani Jayaram and Chitra in 70s and 80s, he gave some of his best compositions to S Janaki in movies like Gejje Pooje, Bellimoda, Upasane, Seetha (1970 film); he chose her whenever the song needed some special singing. ""Gaganavu ello bhoomiyu ello"" remains one of the most memorable songs of S Janaki. If we take the top 10 songs of S Janaki in Kannada cinema there would definitely be at least 2 songs composed by Bhaskar.

"Janaki and voice modulation is synonymous. She has done a wide range of voice modulation according to the age of the character in all four South Indian languages.

"She is perhaps the only singer who won state awards for the same. Tamil Nadu state award for ""Poda poda pokka"" song from Uthiripookkal (1978) and Andhra Pradesh State award for ""Govullu tellana"" song from Saptapadi (1981 film). Songs she sang in kids-voice in 70s in Kannada too were popular, one such song is ""Thayiya thandeya"" from the film Madhura Sangama(1978).
