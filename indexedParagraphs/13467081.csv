"Holland was born Milton Olshansky in Chicago, Illinois, where he attended Theodore Roosevelt High School. His first instrument was the violin. He pursued a passion for percussion, playing in clubs and shows and on CBS Radio in Chicago. By the age of twelve, he was playing at speakeasies for the likes of Al Capone.

"He studied tabla at UCLA and with Ramnad Easwaran.  In India, Holland studied with tabla master Chatur Lal beginning in 1963.
