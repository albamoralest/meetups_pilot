"Between 1987 and 1995, Bill produced a series of promotional mixtapes under the name ""Street DJ Promotions."" These tapes were distributed out of Bill's car to local Chicago area record shops, flea markets, and DJ gigs. These mixes included: Hot Mix #1–17, Non-Stop Hip-Hop, Flashbacks Vol. 1 & 2, Classics Vol. 1–3, Street Style 1 & 2, and Gettin' Wicked.
",7,== History == | === Street DJ Promotions era (1987–1995) ===
"Bill has been credited with the idea of mass-producing mix tapes unlike before, and was apparently inspired by Andre Lopez, owner of the Hot Jams record store. This caught the attention of the Recording Industry Association of America and music publishing houses who were not paid any royalties from the use of copyrighted music on the vast number of mixtapes being produced and sold throughout Chicago by these many DJs. Bill then became a part of the licensed-mix movement and started Mix Connection Multimedia (MCM). He has been generally credited with being the first Chicago DJ to produce legally licensed mixes.
