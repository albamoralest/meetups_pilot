"Born in Santa Monica, California in 1962 and raised in Redding, California, Joss learned to play fiddle from Jana Jae, the one-time wife and fiddle player for Buck Owens and his Buckaroos.  Praised as ""the heir to the Bakersfield throne"" because of his early association with Bakersfield Sound musicians, Joss' playing has been key to hit tunes scored by Merle Haggard & The Strangers and Dwight Yoakam.
