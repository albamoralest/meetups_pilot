"The son of Broadway performers and musicians, he began playing piano and drums at just 5 or 6. He became ""obsessed"" with Jimi Hendrix and began collecting Hendrix recordings after starting guitar at age 11. He listened a great deal to the Hendrix recordings, and by 14 had learned to play in the style of Hendrix. It was at this time that he was exposed to the music of Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Wes Montgomery and began to study Jazz music. His jazz guitar teachers have included John Scofield and Barry Galbraith.
