"Radio Slave began in 2000 as a duo remixing project with Serge Santiago. As a pair Matt and Serge produced bootleg club remixes of songs by Busta Rhymes, Kylie Minogue, Limp Bizkit, Nancy Sinatra and many more pop artists. Around 2002, Serge left to pursue his own musical path leaving Edwards in control of the Radio Slave guise. He continued to produce a string of remixes for well-established artists, before finally releasing his own original material in 2006. From this point onwards, Edwards continued to release his own music, mostly through his own label Rekids, as well as remixing more underground electronic artists. In recent years, he has also released a number of different mix CDs including Fabric 48 and Strictly Rhythm Vol. 5.

"As Radio Slave, Edwards is yet to release a full-length LP. However he has released albums of original material as The Machine, REKID and Quiet Village (with Joel Martin). The Machine is a multi-media venture combining music and visuals. The aural aspect features 6 tracks of experimental soundscapes – using found sounds and taking influence from contemporary electro-acoustic composition. The visual aspect comprises a short film by UK artists Lovely Jon & Mike Keelin, and each track has a corresponding image designed by Australian pop artist Misha Hollenbach. The music is available on CD and vinyl as The Machine's LP 'RedHead' and was released in 2010. The second track Opening Ceremony (Fuse) also appeared on Berlin imprint Innervisions in 2009 remixed by Ame and Dixon.

"As Quiet Village, Edwards released full-length LP 'Silent Movie' on Studio !K7 in 2008. The album was released on both vinyl and CD and focusses on more downtempo, left field music with balearic influences. As REKID, Matt released 14-track album 'Made in Menorca' in 2006 on Soul Jazz Records. The album was released on vinyl as well as CD and takes influence from disco music and deep house.
",5,== Career ==
"In 2011 he collaborated with Japanese toy maker Devilrobots to create a Rekids-themed toy 'No Sleep No Tofu'. The toy is a Japanese Kubrick figure produced by MediCom – a small, limited edition collector's item with a block-style human form similar to Playmobil or Lego. The head of the figure is a detachable block which features the sleeve design for REKIDS036 – Radio Slave – No Sleep (Part Six).
",6,== Career ==
"In May 2012, Edwards released a sample pack with label Sample Magic. The pack features 500MB of percussive and musical loops, hits and effects, designed to be used as tools for electronic music producers. 2012 also saw the launch the 'Pyramids of Mars' label – a multimedia project that incorporates various strands of artistic disciplines. The 2010 album RedHead (under his 'Machine' pseudonym) was re-issued on Pyramids of Mars as part of a deluxe package, including a re-interpretation of the full album by Joe Claussell. The boxset was limited to 50 copies, each hand-painted by Misha Hollenbach, and included triple-vinyl pressings of both Claussell's and Edwards' versions. The release was available exclusively at London's LN-CC store.
