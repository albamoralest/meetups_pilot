Speaking in May 2010 to UK soul writer Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, she stated: ""With this album I wanted to make sure that I showed all sides of me - in terms of variety in the music and in my vocal range - while at the same time making it clear that every song deeply came from my soul. Plus I also wanted to incorporate a little more hip hop this time, and infuse it with my traditional R&B - because I felt that. By making my beats edgier and harder-hitting, I'd show there was more to me than just doing ballads and things of that sort.""On July 8, 2014, Leela James released her fifth studio album, Fall For You. The album's first two singles, ""Say That"" feat. Anthony Hamilton and ""Fall For You"" both reached Top 15 on the Billboard Urban AC charts, with ""Fall For You"" reaching No. 12.
