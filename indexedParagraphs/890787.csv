"David Raksin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, to Jewish parents (of Russian heritage). His father was an orchestra conductor. Raksin played professionally in dance bands while attending Central High School of Philadelphia. He went on to study composition with Harl McDonald at the University of Pennsylvania, and later with Isadore Freed in New York and Arnold Schoenberg in Los Angeles. In New York, Raksin worked as an arranger for Harms/Chappell. One of his earliest film assignments was as assistant to Charlie Chaplin in the composition of the score to Modern Times (1936). He is perhaps best remembered for his score for the film Laura (1944). The theme music for the film, ""Laura"", with the addition of lyrics by Johnny Mercer, became a major hit. During Raksin's lifetime, ""Laura"" was said to be the second most-recorded song in history following ""Stardust"" by Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish.

"Raksin's theme song ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (also called ""Love is For the Very Young"")  for the 1953 film The Bad and the Beautiful (1953) was also a hit, although not as popular as ""Laura"". Raksin insisted that the song be released as an instrumental, because he had resented having to split the proceeds from ""Laura"" with a lyricist. Raksin's theme for ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" was initially disliked by the film's director Vincente Minnelli and producer John Houseman, but was saved from rejection by the intervention of Adolph Green and Betty Comden, who both liked it. The theme has since been praised by Stephen Sondheim, Leonard Rosenman, Richard Rodney Bennett, and Alexander Courage. Sondheim reportedly called it ""one of the best themes ever written in films"".

"Raksin also scored the 1958 film Separate Tables, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award.

Later in life, Raksin taught at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.
