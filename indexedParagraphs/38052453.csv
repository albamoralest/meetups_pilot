"Max Barskih rose to fame in Ukraine and other post-Soviet countries in 2008 as participant of the Ukrainian talent show ""Fabrika Zirok 2"" (Star Factory 2). In 2010, Max Barskih won his first big prize with being awarded ""Best Ukrainian Act"" at the MTV Europe Music Awards. Max Barskih also had his acting debut in 2010, when he starred in Lara Fabian's  musical feature film Mademoiselle Zhivago (that was published in 2013). In 2012, Barskih entered the Eurovision Song Contest Auditions for Ukraine with the English version of his song ""Dance"", but narrowly lost to Gaitana who represented Ukraine in Baku with her song ""Be My Guest"". Max Barskih has won numerous awards, including ""Singer of the Year"" Awards at the Baltic Music Awards 2011, the ""Crystal Microphone"" Awards 2011, the M1 Music Awards 2017, the GQ Men of the Year Awards 2018, the New Radio Awards 2019, the Love Radio Awards 2019 and at the Top Hit Music Awards 2020. Forbes Magazine USA and Vogue Ukraine called Barskih ""the internationally most successful Russian language singer"". Throughout his career, Barskih has worked closely with Alan Badoev, who is his producer and has also directed most of his music videos. Barskih's videos have gained popularity in the CIS nations. The director likes to use a variety of visual effects for many of his videos, such as in the music videos for ""Теряю тебя"" (""Lost in Love"") which was released in 3D format in the CIS nations. Barskih composes the music and writes the lyrics of his songs himself (and was e.g. nominated at the 2019 Russian National Music Awards for ""Lyricist of the Year""), and partly also does the producing. Most of his songs are in Russian, but he has also sung in Ukrainian (e.g. ""Небо"" and ""Двоє"") and in English (e.g. ""Z. Dance"" (partly in English) and ""Silence"" (entirely in English)).
