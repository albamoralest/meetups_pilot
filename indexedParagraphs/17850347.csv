"Neil Stephen Cicierega was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on August 23, 1986. His father was a programmer, which meant he was surrounded by computers while growing up. He has a brother and two sisters. His sister, Emmy, went on to become a storyboard artist for animated series such as Gravity Falls, The Owl House, and the reboot of DuckTales. At a young age, Cicierega started using a simplistic game developing program named Klik & Play. Beginning in the fourth grade, his parents homeschooled him and his siblings. He continued making amateur games, and even began creating digital music to feature in them; he soon shared his music online through MP3.com under the name Trapezoid, which was later renamed to the anagram ""Deporitaz"" at the behest of another band already named Trapezoid. He also began composing MIDI music fragments that were referenced in his later works.

"Cicierega was first known for a series of dadaist or surrealist Flash animations he termed ""Animutation"". Animutations feature arbitrary, nonsensical scenes and pop culture imagery and are typically set to novelty or foreign music, often from the Japanese version of Pokémon.

"Cicierega's Potter Puppet Pals is a comedy series which parodies the book series Harry Potter. It originated as a pair of Flash animations on Newgrounds in 2003, and later resurfaced in the form of a series of live action puppet shows released onto YouTube and PotterPuppetPals.com, starting in 2006. The central characters of the Harry Potter series are portrayed simply by puppets. The most successful Potter Puppet Pals video, The Mysterious Ticking Noise, currently has over 198 million views (as of December 2021). Cicierega has done puppetry live at Harry Potter-themed events.

"Cicierega has also created mashup music under his own name. He released two mashup albums, Mouth Sounds and Mouth Silence, as free downloads in 2014, and a third, Mouth Moods, in 2017.

"In October 2012, Cicierega created the darkly satirical ""Windows 95 Tips, Tricks, and Tweaks"" blog, located at windows95tips.com. In the blog's telling, Windows 95 is a brooding, evil presence bent on dominating humanity. Most of the posts are faked error messages, with disturbing messages like ""Windows needs a lock of your hair to continue,"" but presented in the exact graphical style of Windows 95. The blog has received favorable press attention.

"In February 2019, Cicierega created Endless Jeopardy, a Twitter account that automatically posts a bot-generated Jeopardy! prompt every hour and awards points to the most-liked responses within 15 minutes. In March 2019, he created ""Bot Pops"" (@BotPops), a Twitter account that writes setups for jokes on popsicle sticks, then finishes them with a punchline from the replies. In April 2019 he created ""4:3"" (@FullscreenDream), a Twitter account that randomly makes GIFs from old commercials and CGI shorts. Cicierega was commissioned to make three songs for the TV series Gravity Falls: a theme song, a musical number for Bill Cipher titled ""It's Gonna Get Weird"", and the song ""Goat and a Pig"" (a parody of Natalie Cole's ""This Will Be""). Both of Cicierega's theme songs and ""It's Gonna Get Weird"" were unused, but ""Goat and Pig"" appeared during the credits sequence of season 2 episode ""The Love God"". One of the two unused openings appeared as a bonus track on the 2016 Lemon Demon album Spirit Phone, titled ""Gravitron"".
