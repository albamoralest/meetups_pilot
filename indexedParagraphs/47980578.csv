"After training as a classical pianist, Dikker became a jazz musician after seeing a 1959 televised performance by Horace Silver and Sonny Rollins. He gave his first jazz performance in 1960, in a jazz and poetry concert with Godfried Bomans. He later performed in the bands of Hans Dulfer and Theo Loevendie, and with American instrumentalists Oliver Nelson, Cannonball Adderley, and Don Byas. In the mid-1970s, he founded his Waterland Ensemble. He wrote his first film score in 1981, and has scored over sixty films. Dikker is the founder and chairman of Muziekinstituut MultiMedia, an organization founded in 2006 to promote and encourage collaboration among multimedia composers. He is also a board member of FFACE, the Federation of Film and Audiovisual Composers of Europe. Dikker's sister, Marianne Dikker, is a screenwriter and director.
