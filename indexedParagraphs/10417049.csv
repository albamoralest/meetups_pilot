"Quaye spent several years as a member of Long John Baldry's backing band, Bluesology, which also featured a keyboard player named Reg Dwight, who would soon become known as Elton John. When Bluesology disbanded in 1967, Quaye released a single under the name Caleb called ""Baby Your Phrasing is Bad"" b/w ""Woman of Distinction"" (1967, Philips Records). In 1969 he served as guitarist for the one-off ""flower power"" pop band Argosy (which also included Dwight, Roger Hodgson, and Nigel Olsson) on their single, ""Mr. Boyd"" b/w ""Imagine"". Starting in 1969, Quaye played guitar supporting Elton John at live concerts around the local London area, with what eventually became the nucleus of Hookfoot for sporadic shows.  The live support work continued until Elton formed his original touring band in the spring of 1970, the trio featuring Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson.

"In April 1970, Quaye formed the band Hookfoot with Ian Duck, Roger Pope and David Glover, all of whom were DJM Records house musicians and had backed Elton's earliest live performances. The group's self-titled debut album was a mix of rock and jazz and included songs by Quaye and Duck, in addition to Stephen Stills and Neil Young covers. Quaye played guitar and keyboards on this album. The group's follow-up record Good Times a-Comin'  was a more straight-ahead rock album. A third album was Communication and the last album titled Roarin' . A live album called Hookfoot Live in Memphis, recorded in 1973 was released later.  The group disbanded in 1974 and Quaye stayed in the United States to work as a session musician. He is credited as a guitarist on Bill Quateman's 1973 debut album, Bill Quateman, and toured with Quateman in support of the album.

"Quaye first met Elton John in 1965, and in 1967 helped him to get studio time to record demos at Dick James' studio, where he worked as an engineer. They played together in the Bread and Beer Band, and Quaye produced John's first solo single. Quaye played off and on for more than 10 years with John, both as a session player and later full band member, appearing on all of his earliest recordings and albums as a session player until the beginning of 1972, as well as being a member of Bluesology during 1967/68. He finally fully joined the Elton John Band in May 1975 for the Rock of the Westies and Blue Moves albums, as well as subsequent 1975/76 Elton tours.
