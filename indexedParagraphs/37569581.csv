"Toki Wright stated that ""A Different Mirror"", the title track from his 2009 album, was inspired by Ronald Takaki's A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America, saying: ""Unless we look into a different mirror we will only see our own reflection. American history for example might be all apple pies and American flags for many, but the history of people of color in America is filled with poverty [and] hatred"".
