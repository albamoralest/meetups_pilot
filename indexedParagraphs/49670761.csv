"After studying philosophy at King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia, she went on a road trip across Canada, the United States and Mexico, and documented her travels. She returned to her home in Prince Edward Island with 60–70 hours of footage and taught herself Final Cut Pro at the Island Media Arts Cooperative. Stalking Love (2005) was shown in five film festivals and aired more than 20 times on CBC's documentary channel from 2006 to 2009. According to Clarkes, her experimental documentary is not so much about love as about the people talking about love. She said ""If you ask people about love, their answer is very telling about who they are as a person. You can’t lie about love—or, if you do [...] that still tells something about who you essentially are"".

"What led Mille Clarkes to filmmaking was ""happenstance and serendipity"" While studying at King's College, she made a super-8 experimental film, and unveiled a passion for observing that had been present since she was a child. ""I was [...] a great lover of other people’s worlds. As a child I used to stay with friends and their families for days on end, absorbing their familial culture, smelling their smells, feeling their rhythms… I always loved entering in and out of worlds. I think these two factors (and a million more) have drawn me to documentary as a form of expression.""Place is a recurring theme in her work and her style has often been described as lyrical. In the analysis of place in Clarkes' first feature documentary Stalking Love, Darrell Varga said""The images of the landscape punctuating the film are not to provide a stable sense of place but are linked with the idea of journey and process. Local is mitigated by an idea of the universal in a journey across Canada, through the US, and into Mexico, and includes rich and poor characters, young and old, prostitutes, street people, and priests.""Clarkes is an independent filmmaker and despite the constraints working with a small budget brings, she said: ""There is a great communicative strength in attempting to convey something within the limitations you are given. I think meaning comes from the tension between elements. Many of the amazing new technological tools at our disposal today actually detract, rather than add to a filmic expression. Some of the best moments on film come from what is left out, what is suggested rather than revealed.""She highly values post-production and the editor's role in piecing the work together: ""When a person says they're a director, that can mean so many things, [...] it can mean you direct actors or come up with scripts. But for me, the real creative magic happens in the editing suite.""
