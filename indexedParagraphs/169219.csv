"Alejandra Guzman grew up in the entertainment world having two superstars as her parents.  She had her fair share of being bullied but managed to pull through.  At age 14, the death of her older sister Viridiana Alatriste, who died in a car crash, was one of the saddest moments in her life.  After her sister's passing she became quite rebellious and enjoyed life to the fullest.  She routinely sneaked out of her house to join the vibrant night life of Mexico City.  During those times, Alejandra met Kenny Aviles from the band Kenny y Los Electricos who became her rock mother/mentor.  It was then that she came to realize she belonged on the stage.  Alejandra Guzmán has had several relationships throughout her life. Her first public relationship was with Erik Rubin which did not last long due to conflict with Mexican singer Paulina Rubio over him. She later started a relationship with Pablo Moctezuma, a businessman with whom Guzmán has a daughter, Frída Sofía, born March 1992. She and Moctezuma later separated.

"Guzmán married American businessman Farrell Goodman in 1998. The marriage was destroyed right after, when Goodman was arrested due to carrying narcotics in an airport in Germany. Her last public relationship to date was a little after her divorce from Goodman, with Gerardo Gómez de la Borbolla. They initially had a great relationship but things ended after she suffered a miscarriage and fell into a deep depression, during which time he also wanted to be part of her work team as well as launching a singing career of his own.  Alejandra revealed years later that she ended up having an abortion from a second pregnancy with him.
