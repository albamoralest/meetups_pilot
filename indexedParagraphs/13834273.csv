"Nawal studied at the Music Institute in Kuwait. Nawal's first album was released in 1984. The majority of her albums are not titled, but rather are referred to by number (e.g. Nawal 98, Nawal 99). She has also filmed many music videos (mainly in Lebanon) and was one of the first Khaliji artists to do so. After retiring from her singing career for personal reasons, Nawal returned after five years with a duet performed with Abdullah Rashad, ""Kan Widdi Niltiki"" (""I Wished We Could Have Met"").
