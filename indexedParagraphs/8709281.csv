"Born to actor and musician Katsuhiko Nakagawa, a celebrity in Japan in the 1980s, she was raised in Nakano by her mother after her father's death from leukemia in 1994. Nakagawa found escape from bullies by connecting with Pokémon when she was in 5th grade. ""When I was a kid, I didn't have friends, but I did have Pokémon.""In the 2006 book Shokotan Manual (しょこ☆まにゅ, Shoko Manyu), she wrote that her legal name was Shiyōko (しようこ) rather than Shōko (しょうこ), which she had been using for most of her life. At the time of her birth, she and her mother had to remain in the hospital, and her maternal aunt was left with registering her in the koseki. When her mother's intended name of ""Shōko"" (薔子) was declined due to 薔 being forbidden due to Japanese law, the aunt wrote the name down in hiragana and recorded her name with a large yo rather than its smaller combining form. She made her entertainment debut in 2001, winning the Grand Prix award at the Popolo Girl Audition and representing the Jackie Chan talent agency.
