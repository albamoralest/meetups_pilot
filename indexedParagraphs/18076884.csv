"Nadal was born into an academic family in Buenos Aires, his mother was an anthropologist and visual artist and his father, Enrique Nadal, a film director and a leading fighter for the recognition of the rights of black Argentines. According to his own recollection, he was heavily influenced by the music listened to by his parents, mainly blues and jazz. His ideology involves deep Rastafarian culture from countries like Jamaica and Haiti; one of his inspirations, as with many reggae groups, is Bob Marley. His main influences are related to reggae rhythms and Afro-Argentine culture. Nadal is descendant of Angolan slaves brought to Buenos Aires in the 17th century. He is fluent in Spanish, English and Jamaican Patois.

"In 1984 he played for the first time as a singer in a band. A year later he founded the band Todos Tus Muertos, which blended together reggae with punk influences and hip hop. With this mix, the group was very successful and recorded their first album in 1988 followed by a record deal with Universal Music. Influenced by reggae rhythms and the music of the Afro Argentine community, Nadal is best known for his work with Todos Tus Muertos. Created in the 1980s and separated in 2000, the band produced six albums before its dissolution. In the 1990s, Nadal formed Lumumba, a reggae band, along with his friend, Pablo Molina (also from Todos Tus Muertos) and his brother, Amilcar Nadal. In its short but productive history, it released four albums which met with approval by followers of reggae, but then it was dissolved. In the last albums of Todos Tus Muertos and Lumumba, Fidel felt the need to play more reggae and leave the hard music behind, but when both projects disappeared, he decided to go on by himself.

"In 2001, this new project was born, with a completely rastafarian image and style. The same year, he launched three albums, Selassie I Dios Todopoderoso, with much reggae and pure rasta-vibe lyrics, including a cover of Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, Cuando gime la raza, and Cabeza negra, with numerous guest musicians (which gave more variety to the album and made it different from the first one). Finally, Repatriación appeared, with a number of collaborators, and with another cover of a Tigres del Norte tune, La Puerta Negra. In 2008 he released the hit single International Love, off the album of the same name, whose dreamier/electronic sound has made it a hit on many Latino radio stations and attracted newer non-reggae listeners.
