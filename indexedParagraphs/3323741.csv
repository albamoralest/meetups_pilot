"Elina Avramovna Bystritskaya was born on April 4, 1928 in Kiev into a Jewish family. During World War II, she was evacuated to Astrakhan, where she studied at nursing courses. From the age of 13, worked as a nurse and laboratory assistant in front-line mobile evacuation hospital No. 3261, first in Aktyubinsk, then in Stalino and Odessa, where she lived with her mother (who worked in the same hospital). One of her earliest roles was in Sergei Bondarchuk's and Fridrikh Ermler's Unfinished Story, an archetypal Socialist Realist film. Bystritskaya was personally chosen by Soviet writer Mikhail Sholokhov to play the role of Aksinya in the film adaptation And Quiet Flows the Don, over several other distinguished candidates, notably Nonna Mordyukova. In the 1960s, Bystritskaya turned to theatre work in the Maly Theatre and her appearances on screen grew sporadic. She was named People's Artist of the USSR in 1978. She was President of the USSR and Russian rhythmic gymnastics Federation from 1975 to 1992. She died on 26 April 2019 after a long illness.
