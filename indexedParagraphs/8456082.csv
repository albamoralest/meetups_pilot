"Later in 1981, Lockie went to the United States to join Public Image Ltd (PiL) in New York City, New York, in 1981 in preparation for recording in Chicago, Illinois, in November of that year.  His contributions to PiL stemmed back to PiL's album Metal Box (1979) where he contributed and co-wrote ""Radio 4"" (although not officially credited).

"Due to complications with Virgin and funding, recording in 1981 was delayed.  PiL entered into various recording sessions in New York City during this period until finally entering into Park South Studios to record what became Commercial Zone (1984) in 1982 and 1983.  At this point, Lockie was no longer a contributor to PiL.
