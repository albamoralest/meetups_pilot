"In 2012 Rasmus Nøhr created the festival called Danmark Dejligst. He wanted to get around the country and play his music in smaller places and cities, that normally wouldn't have the opportunity to host music events. So he started playing for free in people's backyards all across the country, and the support from the local communities was huge. The year after - in 2013 - he toured the country again with the Danmark Dejligst concept, now adding more locations. In 2015 the festival grew to 28 events.
