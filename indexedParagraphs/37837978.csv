"Early musical connections for Davidson were in Melbourne when he began working with Stu Thomas, Nique Needles, in Doghouse, and Brass Bed. He also got a taste for macabre performance with Ewan Cameron in Theatre of Hell, and took part in Premeditated Depredation, a freak performance art piece.  After six years in Melbourne, he started to turn his attention to country music and solo performance.

"No Depression described the sound of Davidson's 2010 album Decapitation as ""altogether dirty, lonesome, restless and wildly engrossing.""Anthony Healey, Australasian Performing Right Association's (APRA) Director of NZ Operations, said of the song 'You're a Loser"" from Davidson's album Bad Luck Man: ""There is an honesty and integrity to all Delaney's songs and is evidenced in spades in 'You're a Loser'. This song is anything but a loser and we are immensely proud of the reputation Delaney has achieved both internationally and at home."" The song won Best Song at the New Zealand Country Music Awards. Davidson's 2011 album Bad Luck Man featured the track 'Little Heart', which threw him into the spotlight as a finalist in the 2011 APRA Silver Scroll Awards. Although he didn't win, he was thought of as the people's favourite. In 2013, Davidson collaborated with fellow New Zealand musician Marlon Williams (of the Unfaithful Ways) for the album Sad But True – The Secret History of Country Music Songwriting Volume 1. It was received positive reviews in mainstream publications, with The New Zealand Herald dubbing the collaboration ""seamless"" and a ""heady concoction of truth-seeking"". It was also praised for seamlessly harmonising the young ""clean"" voice of Williams with the ""darker"" vocals of Davidson. The album later won Davidson and Williams won the New Zealand Music Awards' Country Music Album of the Year. RIANZ managing director, Chris Caddick, congratulated Davidson and Williams on their win. ""Well done to Delaney and Marlon on their richly deserved Tui for the album Sad But True. Their take on a classic American art form is brilliantly executed and a real joy to listen to.""Davidson followed up the first volume of Sad But True with two more instalments, the second self-released on The Grand Ole Hayride tour. The third volume, Juke-Box B-Sides, reached number 12 on the New Zealand Albums Chart in February 2014. Davidson was also the winner of the APRA New Zealand Country Music Song of the Year three years in a row.
