"Giménez was the daughter of María Luisa Sanders, of Irish descent, and Augusto Giménez Aubert, of Spanish descent. She had a hard childhood, tainted by her parents' separation. She studied in Quilmes, and graduated from La Anunciata Collegiate as a primary school teacher, a profession she never practised. Before becoming famous, for a couple of years Giménez worked as an executive secretary for a large factory.
