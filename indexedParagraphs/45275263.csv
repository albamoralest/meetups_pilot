"Prum was born in Fullerton, California, attended Troy High School's technology magnet, and later studied sound for film & video as an undergraduate student at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in the 1990s under John Payne, Craig Smith, and Doug Loveid. While studying at CalArts, Prum worked on many student films, some of which were screened at festivals, such as Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation. One such film, a parody of Schoolhouse Rock! titled Political Correction, was a collaboration between Prum and fellow student Steven Fonti. Another was Adam Lane's Sea Slugs, a stop-motion animation about pirate slugs on the open seas, which was also featured as part of MTV's Cartoon Sushi. After graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, Prum worked as an Electron at Jim Henson's Creature Shop and then briefly at Disney Online. After being let go, he inquired during a CalArts job fair about employment opportunities in the sound department of LucasArts Entertainment Company. He joined the LucasArts sound team in January 1999 and was involved with all of the Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace release titles and most of the other games published by both LucasArts and Lucas Learning between early 1999 and the beginning of 2001.
