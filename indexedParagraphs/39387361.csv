"Veselin started his involvement with music when he was in the 7th grade. He started to play and sing in a school group. During the compulsory military service Veselin Marinov realized that the music is his destiny and he applied in National Academy of Music (Bulgaria). In 1981, at the beginning of his studies, he was invited to become the lead singer of Bulgarian rock band Impuls. His first stage appearance was on 2 December 1982 in Vidin, Bulgaria. The band produced progressive rock music, and their first song with Marinov on vocals was Midnight music. The first song which was composed by Marinov himself was You came. In 1983, he graduated the Pop Music Department of Bulgarian Music Academy in the class of Petar Dimitrov.

"In 1987, his first solo album, ""From love"", was released. After releasing his second album (""About Love""- 1990), Veselin Marinov relocated to Germany due to financial problems and very low sales of his plate. He has been working in Germany for four years and has released two albums there. Marinov returned to Bulgaria in 1994 because of a tooth inflammation. After the surgery he started working with the leading authors in Bulgaria, Toncho Rusev and Evtim Evtimov, and recorded three of his most popular songs - ""You are the love"" (bulg. ""Ти си любовта""), ""Bitter wine"" (bulg. ""Горчиво вино"") and ""For you, Bulgaria"" (bulg. ""За теб, Българийо""). These songs bring him great success and make him one of the most beloved and popular names in Bulgarian pop music.
