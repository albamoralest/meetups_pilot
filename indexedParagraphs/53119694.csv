"On March 30, 2013, at Seoul Gangnam Renaissance Hotel, Horan married an IT technician who she had dated in college. Fluxus announced that the couple had divorced in July 2016 after three years of marriage. On September 29, 2016, at around 6 am, Horan rammed a cleaning truck on Seongsu Bridge in Seoul while on her way to host her daily morning radio show on SBS Power FM. The driver of the truck was taken to hospital for minor injuries, while Horan was booked by Seoul Gangnam Police without arrest on a DUI charge. Horan's blood-alcohol level was found to be 0.106 percent, high enough to have her driving license revoked. Horan had previously been booked for DUI charges in 2004 and 2007 making this her third. The case was sent to the Prosecutor in October. Fluxus released an official statement regarding the charge, apologising and halting all of Horan's activities. On January 9, 2017, Horan was fined ₩7 million ($5,800), taking into account Horan's out-of-court settlement with the injured truck driver.
