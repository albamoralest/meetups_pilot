"Al Mohandis was born 25, October 1971 in Baghdad, Iraq. He studied Engineering in Baghdad, hence the nickname ""Al Mohandis (المهندس),"" which means ""the engineer"" in Arabic. He was raised in a large Muslim family, where he was diligent about work. Upon finishing his university studies, he maintained an interest in arts. Al Mohandis had always aspired to become a musician, despite his family's opposition and anger in the matter; he opposed his parent's desire, however, and finished his higher education besides his lifelong passion: Music. Majid even worked as a tailor for several years while chasing his artistic ambitions. It was then when he had bought himself his first 'oud to practice and evolve as a musician.
