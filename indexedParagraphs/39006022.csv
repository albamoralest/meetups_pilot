"In 1977, Remote established Aura Sonic to handle a variety of his recording duties: live albums, live television and radio broadcasts, and film and video concert remotes.  Not content with operating a conventional recording studio, he decided to create a studio on wheels so he could go to the client instead of the client going to him.  Most of what he learned about audio did not come through formal training but through hands on experience. Selected artists recorded, engineered, mixed and/or produced by Remote include Aerosmith, Allman Brothers Band, Beck, The Beach Boys, The Black Crowes, Blink 182, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Carlos Santana, Chick Corea, Coldplay, Donald Harrison with Ron Carter & Billy Cobham, Eddie Palmieri, Frank Zappa, Green Day, Hall & Oates, Herbie Hancock, James Blunt, Jane’s Addiction, Jeff Buckley, Jim James, Joshua Redman Quartet, Lenny Kravitz, Marcus Miller, Radiohead, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Stevie Wonder, Stone Temple Pilots, The Avett Brothers, The Police, Trombone Shorty and Orleans Avenue and Wayne Shorter.
