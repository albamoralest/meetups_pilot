"Michalitsianos was born in Wimbledon, England and grew up in Australia and Greece. After studying piano and cello, she studied contemporary composition and orchestra at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. At the age of 23, Michalitsianos moved to the United States at the invitation of Mark Linkous, where she performed on the albums Good Morning Spider and It's a Wonderful Life by his indie rock band Sparklehorse. After her time with Sparklehorse, Michalitsianos moved to Upstate New York, where she set up her own studio.  Though the studio and almost all her compositions were destroyed in an explosion, Michalitsianos herself was not harmed. On April 10, 2006, she released her debut album The Bells of 1 2 on Grönland Records/Rough Trade. Michalitsianos wrote, sang, played and produced all 12 tracks on the album herself. The track ""Enter One"" was featured in several films and TV shows: Son of a Gun, Dark (season 1, episode 6), Final Space (season 1, episode 6) and Ideal (season 4, episode 8).
