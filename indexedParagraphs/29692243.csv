"The Southernaires, organized in 1929, were an American popular vocal group, popular in radio broadcasting of the 1930s and 1940s. They were known for their renditions of spirituals and work songs. In 1942, they won a widely publicized case of hotel discrimination. Their best known recording, ""Nobody Knows De Trouble I've Seen"", was released by Decca (2859-B) in 1939. Pianist-arranger Spencer Odom replaced their previous accompanist, Clarence M. Jones, the same year. In 1948-49, they hosted a 30-minute show, The Southernaires Quartet, on Sundays on the American Broadcasting Company television network.
