",1,== History ==
"Growing up in a music-oriented family, Wasscass' life was filled with sounds of Kiss, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard or Judas Priest at a very early age already.
",2,== History ==
"He became familiar with the world of EBM and Techno with records from Tommi Stumpff, Nitzer Ebb, Front Line Assembly and cubic22 from Berlin.
",3,== History ==
"Buying his first turntables in 1992, he started his DJ career with his first gig as ""al cutter"" at club Cinderella in Tübingen in 1993.
",4,== History ==
"He started the set with a 15-minute intro, followed by a solid gabba and hardcore set. Although this might have been the starting point, he was still missing a direction.
",5,== History ==
"During those days, DJ Sven Väth fascinated all revelers with ingenious hardfloor from Frankfurt. Wasscass' encounter with Väth at Southern Germany's number 1 club ""Oz"" gave him the greencard for 1994's Futuresonic Party in Stuttgart, playing a set with four decks with flying colours.
",6,== History ==
"Taking a break from DJing in 2001, he came back even bigger in 2007. Mainly being booked for industrial high-class rooftop parties always far from the mainstream, he also played all kinds of styles in clubs and radio stations, finding its peak at the Kazantip festival.
",7,== History ==
"Nowadays, he only returns to the decks for the virtual community, despite not being the biggest supporter of social media.
",8,== History ==
"In 1999 he opened his own club, ""Alte Stilfabrik"" (Nox Club), closing in 2002 due to conceptual deviations.
",9,== History ==
"Wasscass started producing own tracks in 1996, never sticking to a certain style or genre.
",10,== History ==
"Since then, he is producing several projects of different kinds of styles, with slaxory being the first sub-project evolving from the idea of a T-shirt label in 2008.
",11,== History ==
"All of his projects have one thing in common - representing underground, aiming to establish a new genre, far from the norm. The latest release ""Airport"" is the best example.
",12,== History ==
"He never reached for the limelight, avoiding commercial publicity wherever possible.
