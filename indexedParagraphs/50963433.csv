"Bryce Ross-Johnson was born on June 16, 1988, in New York City, New York to Tracey Ross and Brad Johnson. In 1989, when Ross-Johnson was one, his mother moved them both to Los Angeles, California so she could pursue a career as an actress. 11 years later, she got a part on the hit soap opera Passions, which allowed Ross-Johnson to spend the majority of his youth in Westlake Village. When his father introduced him to '90s R&B, he convinced his mother to buy him a guitar at the age of 13. He taught himself how to play the guitar.
