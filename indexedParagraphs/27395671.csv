"Jensen was a native Hawaiian athletic song stylist whose ""white hot soul"" electrified audiences. He was of Hawaiian, French, Danish, English and Irish descent. A graduate of Farrington High School, he first used the stage name Lance Curtis.  He was a main showroom caliber draw who filled rooms at the Outrigger Waikiki, the Oceania Floating Restaurant, Hilton Hawaiian Dome, Reef Towers Polynesian Palace and the Hula Hut. By 1968, this one-time opening act for the Rolling Stones had become an international performer, signing with Don Costa Productions and began performing at the El Quid in Mexico City.  He often divided his career between the islands and Las Vegas, Nevada. Jensen earned the sobriquet ""The Giant"" because of his tall stature, but he had a talent to match that nickname.  His vocal stylings came deep from his Hawaiian soul, as he danced around the stage.  Some have compared seeing his physicality on stage to watching the seemingly effortless glide of a  professional ice skater. In 1970, he was appearing at the Century Plaza in New York City,  in his debut of that city.  In 1970, 1971, 1972  and 1973, he appeared at the Copacabana in New York,  aptly being compared to James Brown, the superstar most analogous to Jensen's onstage style.
