"Aina Suzuki had hoped to work in anime since her elementary school days, but thought her voice might not be good enough. A turning point came when, in her 3rd year of high school, she became a finalist (and one of the best 3 in the nationals) of the 7th All-Japan Anisong Grand Prix. At that time, her desire to become an anisong singer intensified and she made it her goal. She moved to Tokyo as soon as she had graduated from high school. She later revealed that, if she would have won the Anisong Grand Prix, she would have had her major debut the next year (2014) and would have been able to participate in a tournament to be held at the Yokohama Arena; this was revealed in February 2017, after the success of Aqours 1st LoveLive which incidentally had a leg performed in Yokohama Arena.

However, after some encouragement from Ryo Horikawa (chief director of the institute) she started to have more confidence. This reignited her desire to become an anisong singer and voice actress after arriving in Tokyo.
