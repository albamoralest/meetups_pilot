"Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, Michael grew up in a mixed-race family.  His father is African-American and his mother is bi-racial.  This had quite an effect on him as a child growing up and would serve as one of his main messages in later musical work.  He is a self-taught vocalist with a five octave range. Kevin cites artists like Prince, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder as some of his biggest musical influences.  At the age of 16 he wrote his first song, and has continued writing his own material throughout the years.  Kevin says he loves writing music just as much as singing it.

"Michael received attention from Virgin Records and Columbia Records while still a teenager, but ultimately signed with Atlantic Records and their Downtown Records imprint. His first EP Ya Dig? was featured only on iTunes and the buzz single ""We All Want The Same Thing"" was highlighted on iTunes Store as the Single of the Week for May 8, 2007. ""We All Want The Same Thing"" featured rapper Lupe Fiasco and was featured in a Verizon Wireless V CAST Song ID commercial. Kevin Michael's first official single from his full-length LP was ""It Don't Make Any Difference"", both produced by and featuring Wyclef Jean.  In the song Kevin talks about interracial relationships and the product of being a bi-racial adult himself.  A video for the song was shot in Brooklyn, NY in May 2007 directed by video collective Syndrome (James Larese).  The video and song was received well by both MTV and VH1 Soul.
