"Manoukian's education history is unusual for a musician. She did not go to a music school and trained privately as a violinist with Dorothy DeLay in New York as well as with her parents in Toronto. She also received independent lessons in core musical subjects like harmony and chamber music. This gave her the time to also pursue a non-musical education. She has an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto (with high distinction) and has done graduate-level work in philosophy (focusing on areas like epistemology and the philosophy of mind). She is now on sabbatical from the PhD programme in philosophy at the University of Toronto.
",8,== Biography == | === Education ===
"Manoukian attributes her interest in philosophy to a desire since childhood to understand what musicians do, from a wider perspective than just playing allows. This has recently grown into a project to apply her philosophical thinking to theories about teaching and developing professional artists. She credits Dorothy DeLay for instilling this interest in her.
