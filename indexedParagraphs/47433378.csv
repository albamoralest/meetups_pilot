"Dada Life is named after the Dada art movement in 20th century Europe. Dada was a form of artistic anarchy fighting against the cultural, political, and social values of the time. In the same way, Dada Life and rave culture as a whole is a protest to return to the experience of the body and away from the capitalistic and rationalist dogma of today's society.

"Bacterial Orchestra was released in 2006 as a ""self-organizing evolutionary musical organism"". The installation consists of several audio cells, with every cell listening to its surroundings and picking up sounds, trying to play together in a musical way. The musical material comes from the background noise, people talking or sounds played by other cells. One installation (Public Epidemic No 1) received an honorary mention at File Prix Lux 2010 (Interactive Art) Released in 2008, Chambertronica is the meeting of three chamber musicians and three electronica-artists, initiated by Håkan Lidbo, George Kentros, Olle Cornéer, Anna Petrini, Mika Takehara, and Lisa Nordström. In 2011 Olle released ""New Flesh Network""  a musical performance for traditional choir, controlled via a network by the artists in real-time. Every person in the choir wears a pair of ear muffs canceling out all sounds, making them hear only the instructions that they individually receive in their in-ear headphones.
