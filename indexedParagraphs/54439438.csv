"Scrojo was born in Oceanside, California, and began his career as a professional artist in the late 1980s while he was an employee of the San Diego-based Pannikin coffeehouse chain, where he decorated chalkboards with his whimsical and sometimes disturbing art. His efforts proved very popular and led to his designing chalkboard art, T-shirts and logos for 25 to 30 San Diego cafes. It was also at this time that his work was noticed by Grammy winning producer Chris Goldsmith who hired him to create a poster for a gig at the Belly Up in Solana Beach. The club loved the poster and a decades spanning association began.

"Scrojo's poster and chalkboard work grabbed the attention of the multitude of surf and skateboard companies based in coastal So-Cal in the 1990s. Scrojo designed T-shirts, skateboard decks, advertising and other merchandise for dozens of action sports companies based between Del Mar and Costa Mesa.  These companies include Quiksilver, O'Neill, Nectar, Tum Yeto, DGK Skateboards and Tracker Trucks. The most notable of this work was an early design, the original label for Sticky Bumps Surfwax for Wax Research. Illustrated freehand with a pen on a scrap piece of paper, the logo helped propel the brand to become the top selling surf wax in the world selling millions of bars.
