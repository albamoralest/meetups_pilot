"Carolina Márquez (born 22 September 1975), is a Colombian-Italian singer, songwriter, dancer and record producer who resides in Rome. Márquez left Colombia in 1986 for Spain to study drama at the Escuela de Arte Dramático in Barcelona. In 1991, she moved with her family to Venice, Italy where she studied modern languages and literature. Her first notable musical success was with ""S.E.X.O."", a song she had written, after performing it in Milan in front of 80,000 spectators. The song became a pan-European club hit. Capitalizing on this success, she released her first dance album Más Música on Do It Yourself and on Virgin Italy record labels. The album comprised fifteen tracks that she had written, performed and produced.
