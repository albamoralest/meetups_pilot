"Gaber began to play as rehabilitation for an injury to his hand which required constant but not strenuous activity to recover his motor skill.  Since his health as a child was not the best and his older brother Marcello played guitar, he was encouraged to play as well.  The outcome was good both in terms of his health and artistically, and at only fourteen years of age he was engaged to play at a New Eve's party and earned his first paycheck of 1,000 lire.

He then played with the Rocky Mountains Old Time Stompers (replacing Tony Dallara who had left to pursue a solo career) and with Rolling Crew.
