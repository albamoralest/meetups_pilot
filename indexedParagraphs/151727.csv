"In the earliest known record of his musical career, David Marley performed as part of a singing group called The Seven Do Bees, made up of him and his classmates, and wherein he was given the stage name ""Freddie Dic"". The name never stuck, however, and instead, David went on to become known as ""Ziggy"", a nickname often reported to have been given to him by his father Bob Marley, meaning ""little spliff"". However, Ziggy stated the following to Melody Maker magazine in 1988: ""Me name David but me big Bowie fan. So at the time of the Ziggy Stardust album, me call meself Ziggy and now everyone do.""During the late 1970s, Ziggy could also be seen alongside his brother Stephen at some of their father's larger concerts around Jamaica and abroad. In 1978, the duo appeared on stage at the One Love Peace Concert in Kingston, and the following year at Reggae Sunsplash II in Montego Bay.

"In 1979, Ziggy and his siblings Sharon, Cedella and Stephen formed the Melody Makers (named after the British weekly pop/rock music newspaper, Melody Maker) and made their recording debut with ""Children Playing in the Streets"". The track was written for them by their father, who had composed the song for them four years earlier. All royalties from the single were pledged to the United Nations, to aid its efforts during the International Year of the Child. The Melody Makers made their onstage debut as a group on 23 September 1979, performing on the same bill as their father for the first and only time at the ""Roots Rock Reggae"" two-day concert series in Kingston's National Arena. Ziggy was 11 years old at the time. Notable other early moments in Ziggy's musical history include a performance with Stephen at their father's funeral in 1981, and later that year the Melody Makers released their second single, ""What A Plot"", under the family's Tuff Gong record label. The Melody Makers recorded an unreleased album titled Children Playing in 1979.

Cryptic Rock gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, stating ""Politically and socially relevant, Rebellion Rises is a war of music, creating peace with a purpose."". Island Stage called the album ""a 10-track masterpiece that continues his father’s tradition of promoting emancipation from mental slavery through education, social activism, and healthy living."" Reggaeville said the album ""is not an angry record. It is not a bitter record. But, it is not a record of hope, either. The time of hoping for change is a notion Marley considers past due. This is a record of action, and for Ziggy Marley, the time for action is now.""
