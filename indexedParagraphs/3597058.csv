",1,== Musical career ==
"Maximo Antonio del Rosario is best known for his Merengue numbers. As a member of Los Hermanos Rosario, Rosario has been a key figure in popularizing Merengue music, with hits reaching the top of the Billboard Latin charts and the top of charts in Europe. Rosario is the top selling Merengue artist of all time. The three-time Grammy nominee has sold more than 100 million albums worldwide. He is best known for his Romantic Merengue renditions.
",2,== Musical career ==
"Toño Rosario and his brothers were always interested in music. From young, they recall finding whatever instruments they could in household items since they were born in poverty and could not afford real musical instruments. The group in which Toño started his musical career was formed in 1978 and its name is ""Los Hermanos Rosario"": it consisted of himself, his brothers Pepe and Rafa (as the lead singers) and brothers Luis, Tony, and Francis (as the instrument players). They used to play in their neighbors houses and this is how they eventually got to be known and discovered. After the death of their brother Pepe, Toño and Rafa took the lead in the band with Toño as the main singer due to his unique and highly recognized voice.
",3,== Musical career ==
"In the late 1980s, after 12 years of being with his brothers, Toño was removed from the group and began his own solo career. He debuted on April 14, 1990, in the ""Roberto Clemente"" Coliseum of Puerto Rico. He went on to become the most popular merengue singer with some of his albums reaching diamond status. Toño's song ""Alegría"" was played at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan whenever former Detroit Tigers utility infielder Omar Infante came to bat. Toño Rosario has the best selling merengue album of all time, Quiero Volver a Empezar, which was his debut on WEA International in 1996.
",4,== Musical career ==
"Rosario is a minority owner/limited partner of the Miami Dolphins NFL team. Rosario was the first solo merengue act to ever sell out Madison Square Garden.
",5,== Musical career ==
"In 2018, his song ""Kulikitaka"" became an internet sensation in the southern Indian Member State of Kerala. It became very famous and was used in numerous stage shows, video albums and even in the most famous Malayalam web series Karikku's Thera Para [1]. In Kerala it  became famous as an African song and not as a Latin song because of a video that circulated in Whatsapp. Even small restaurants started getting named after the song in Kerala. Tono Rosario married Marilyn Brenes in 1983, at Marriage Palace, in New York City.
