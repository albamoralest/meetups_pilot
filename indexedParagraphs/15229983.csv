",5,N/A
"In the mid-1940s, songs were performed as ballads that had Arabic themes and were mostly needles and gloomy. The course was attended by singers Qasim Jebeli, Manouchehr Shafiee, Alfred Lazarian and Houshang Shokati. Some poets and translators translated the lyrics of the European song ""Wow to Wow"". Hamid Ghanbari and Jamshid Sheibani were among the first to perform the translated lyrics with the same original song. This style was pop, but it was not Iranian. In the early 1950s, love songs were performed with Western orchestration and Persian theology. This style of songs was presented to the public by Mohammad Noori, Vigen and Manouchehr Sakhaei.

",8,N/A
"Love Songs Aref had suffered many hardships in his life, so there was a ""disdain"" in his voice. His loneliness also made the songs he sang more palpable to the listener, and the sense of the song conveyed well. This was lost by performing the song ""Lake of Light (= Daryache ye Noor)"",  and he had to use his thoughts to create it in his songs to create sense. (Aref never used smoke or alcohol) Shahbal Shab-pareh wrote in  ""The Pop Fader song"" about Aref: ""The Sultan(=King) of Hearts was Aref, reading it was for the heart of love. Everything he read smelled of love , promising , friendship and compromise""

"New Persian Songs : In the early 1970s, great songwriters such as Shahyar Ghanbari, Ardalan Sarfaraz and Iraj Jannati-Ataei began to change the course of songs and used heavy Persian literature. These types of poets were like unknown 2-3 equations that led the listener astray. Aref sought to perform simple poets that would be tangible to the listener. Like the song ""I Don't Believe (=delam bavar nadareh)"" with a poem by Shahyar Ghanbari that was performed in the mid-1960s : [ I know, like everyone else, you'll be fed up with me, and you'll be saddened by my grief / These two white hands in my hand, I know, will eventually put my hand back / I know, but I don't believe it's enough that it's simple, it brings me bad back ]

"Song ""Music"": The song was recorded in collaboration with 24 Iranian artists produced by Tapesh-TV in 2006. The songwriter was Paksima Zakipour and her composer and arranger by Ramon. Featured Songs : 1. Burning and Instrument (=sooro-saze): The song is the result of Arif's collaboration with Parviz Maqsadi, which marked a turning point in his fame. Aref says: ""Early on, I sang every song I was offered, but later I decided not to play a song that didn't sit in my heart. That's why I tried my best to sing my favorite songs, and the beginning of these songs was ""Burning and Instrument"", which was welcomed by everyone. Elusive shadow (=Saaye-gorizan): The song was released in 1967 and topped the best-selling songs for weeks. The elusive shadow is based on a song by ""I saw her standing there"" , whose rhythm has been transformed from two-fourth to six-eighth, and is played in the style of the ""Beatles"" with three guitars. The song's composer was Parviz Khatibi, who helped Aref and Zaven Ohanian (the arranger of the work) to transform the rhythm. ""Lake of Light (=Daryache-Noor)"": The song was performed and released in 1968 with a beautiful melody by Parviz Maqsadi. ""Daryache-Noor"" was ranked second in the best song of 1968 by the singers of ""Majale-Javanan"" ( famous Iranian journal ), which made Aref more popular. Aref's sense of satisfaction was so much that he forgot about his sadly-voice. Aref says: ""When the song ""Daryache-Noor"" was very muddy, Vigen also went to a destination to compose a song at this level, and he wrote ""Gole-sorkh"", which was highly regarded.
