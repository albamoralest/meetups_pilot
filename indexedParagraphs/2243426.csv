"Blue Magic was formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1972 when former member of The Delfonics, Randy Cain, brought in singer-songwriter Ted Mills to do some writing with the Philly-based WMOT production company to create a new band. A short time later the group Shades of Love, featuring Keith Beaton, Richard Pratt, Vernon Sawyer and his brother Wendell, came in to audition. (According to Marc Taylor in his book A Touch of Classic Soul of the Early 1970s, ""although the group performed admirably, they lacked a standout lead singer"".) The execs decided to replace the Toppicks, the act Mills recorded with. They inserted Shades of Love (which they owned contractually) with Ted Mills and retitled the group Blue Magic. They were signed with Atco Records through WMOT in the same year.

"The group was one of the earliest acts produced by Norman Harris, a Philadelphia recording veteran. The group's harmonies were supported by the MFSB studio house band. Their first early song release in 1973 was ""Spell"" which went onto the US Billboard R&B chart peaking at No. 30 (it was written and co-produced by Mills). They were known for making dreamy ballads and their choreographed stage moves. Their second release was the uptempo ""Look Me Up""; which reached number 36, stayed on the R&B chart for 11 weeks, and was popular on the early disco scene. Their next single was the ballad ""Stop to Start"". This hit was even more successful, reaching number 14 on the Billboard R&B chart and number 74 on the pop chart. The next single release became their first Billboard US Top 10 R&B and Pop hit, ""Sideshow"". It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on August 16, 1974. It climbed to number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the R&B chart. The Blue Magic album also went gold. In addition to the four hit singles, it also included another Richard Dickson inspired creation, the hit ballad ""What's Come Over Me"", a seven-minute rendition of the Main Ingredient million seller ""Just Don't Want To Be Lonely"", the solid album closer ""Tear It Down"", and the uptempo ""Welcome to the Club"". The first single from their 1975 follow-up album The Magic of the Blue, entitled ""Three Ring Circus"", also sold well, reaching number 36 in the pop chart and number 5 R&B. MFSB guitarist Bobby Eli and Vinnie Barrett co-wrote both ""Sideshow"" and ""Three Ring Circus"". Because their biggest hits were slower songs, the group became known mostly for their ballads.

"The album Thirteen Blue Magic Lane in 1975 maintained the group's popularity, and spawned their version of the popular dance number ""We're On The Right Track"", as well as the ballad ""Chasing Rainbows"". The song ""What's Come Over Me"" from their debut album was re-worked as a duet with Margie Joseph dubbed in alongside Mills' original lead vocals. The new approach saw the song climb to number 11 on the R&B chart again in 1975. In total, the group had two R&B chart singles in 1975 and four in 1976.

"By 1977, the group's popularity had faded with the rise of disco and changing music styles, and despite the group continuing to record consistently they failed to chart. Subsequent label moves to Capitol Records for a reunion with Norman Harris (who had left two years earlier) and then the smaller label Mirage resulted in some smaller R&B charting, but no major success.
