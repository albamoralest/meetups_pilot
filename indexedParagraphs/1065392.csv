"Barrett was born in Penarth, near Cardiff, and grew up more interested in films and film soundtracks than rock or pop music; he cites Wendy Carlos's A Clockwork Orange soundtrack album and the Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner as defining musical influences. Whilst studying film making in Newport, he heard J Majik's Arabian Nights which turned the then 17-year-old Barrett on to drum and bass music. Barrett used to work in Cardiff's only electronic record shop, Catapult. A short time after he began to make music, he was given a DJ residency at Cardiff's drum and bass night, named Silent Running. During his residency at Silent Running, Barrett played alongside artists such as Grooverider and London Elektricity.

In 2007, he delivered his second effort, selected as 'Essential Mix of the Year' by Pete Tong. His third album Tough Guys Don't Dance was released in October 2007. The second single from the album, ""If We Ever"", was supported on Radio 1 by Annie Mac, Zane Lowe and Jo Whiley helping it to reach number 1 in the DnB chart, number 1 in the dance chart and number 4 in the Indie chart. In 2008, High Contrast remixed the #1 single ""No Way to Say"" for Japanese pop singer Ayumi Hamasaki's remix album, Ayu-mi-x 6: Silver. He also made successful remixes of ""Hometown Glory"" by Adele and ""Pjanoo"" by Eric Prydz, which were later included on the album, Confidential. He played them during his take over for the Rob Da Bank show on BBC Radio 1 in January 2009.
