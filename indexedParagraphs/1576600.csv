"Treach was arrested in Union City, New Jersey on April 10, 2014. He allegedly passed traffic police in his Cadillac Escalade at 55 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone and attempted to elude law enforcement officers after being given a signal to stop, leading them on a high-speed chase for nine blocks before stopping. He then left his vehicle and ran towards the police car; the officers drew their weapons and ordered him to return to his vehicle. Treach later complied with the officers' orders and was cited for reckless driving, speeding and driving with a suspended license. Officers also found there was a warrant for his arrest out of Essex County, New Jersey for failing to appear at a hearing related to child support, and warrants out of Union City and Secaucus, New Jersey for failing to appear at hearings related to motor vehicle violations. He made his first court appearance on the charge in Jersey City, New Jersey on April 11 and spent the night in Hudson County jail in Kearny before being released after posting $15,000 bail.
