"Schneider was born on April 8, 1960, in Mount Kisco, New York, the youngest of three boys for Shirley Conklin and John ""Jack"" Schneider III, a pilot who had served in the U.S. Air Force. His mother is from Sanford, Florida. His family included an older brother Robert, an artist living in southern New York. His other brother (also called John) died of lung failure age 3, three years before John's birth. John's life as an entertainer began at the age of eight, when he put on magic shows for his peers and their families. This once got him into trouble, when he had himself chained up and tossed into a swimming pool with the intention of re-creating Harry Houdini's legendary escape act. When he was 14, he and his mother moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where his love for performing continued. He went to North Springs High School in Sandy Springs, Georgia.

"At the age of 18, he won the role of Bo Duke, working alongside another newcomer Tom Wopat and veteran actor James Best. For his audition, he ""borrowed a dilapidated pickup truck, put on a big ol' country accent and funky hat. I hadn't shaved and went in toting a beer. I don't know whether they believed it or not, but they liked it."" Schneider learned to drive the iconic Dodge Charger in the show, but to the disappointment of many fans, he admitted he never jumped the car due to the dangerous nature of the stunt. At the height of the series' popularity, he also became a recording artist and a face of merchandise. In 1982, a tangle of legal suits with the producers over the distribution of merchandising royalties sent Schneider and co-star Tom Wopat leaving the show for most of a season. They returned to their roles in February 1983, only after their claims were satisfied. The show was canceled in 1985, after seven seasons. Schneider directed the series finale, titled Opening Night at the Boar's Nest, airing originally on CBS, February 8, 1985.

On June 12, 2018, Schneider spoke to Fox News regarding his upcoming three-day jail sentence for failing to pay alimony to his estranged wife Elvira Castle. He said he has had hard financial times and he has spent his money on repairing his studio in Louisiana which was destroyed in a August 2016 flood. He was arrested at 10:29 AM and released at 3:45 PM. The short imprisonment was due to the overcrowded prison. He contrasted the warm treatment of the prison guards to the ""guilty until proven innocent"" treatment he received in the court system. However, he still has to do 240 hours of community service and pay the debt to Elvira, or else he faces an imprisonment of five years.
