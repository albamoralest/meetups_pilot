"Walker grew up in Texas and learned to play guitar in his teens in Houston.  He worked with Lonesome Sundown and Lonnie Brooks, and briefly joined Clifton Chenier's band in the 1950s. By the 1960s he was in a R&B band in Los Angeles with his wife Ina, who used the stage name Bea Bopp. His album Bottom of the Top was released by Playboy in 1973. Further albums were released on Black Top, Hightone, JSP, Joliet, and Rounder Records. Walker was also known for his variety of styles and the changes he would often make for each album. Not until 1969 did he begin to record more regularly, when he joined with the record producer, Bruce Bromberg. He appeared on show 237 of the WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour in 2002 when Live at Biscuits & Blues had just been released.
