"He began his career singing gospel music before switching to R&B.  In 1954 he won a recording contract with Savoy Records, which yielded a series of hits, including ""Don't Be Angry"" (No. 2 R&B, No. 25 pop, 1955), ""Pitter Patter"" (No. 10 R&B, 1955), ""Little By Little"" (No. 57 pop, 1956), and ""It Don't Hurt No More"" (No. 8 R&B, No. 89 pop, 1958).  Brown was among the biggest stars in R&B, frequently touring with the revues of Alan Freed. His songs, along with those of his peers and contemporaries (such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Fats Domino), were among the first wave of African-American pop music to become noticed and popular with white audiences. Elvis Presley reportedly used to see Brown perform whenever he appeared in Memphis. In addition to Brown's influence on blues music, and 1950s R&B and pop, Brown's powerful and protean voice, combined with his distinctive emotive style, is widely viewed as a key link in the development of soul music.

"In the early 1980s, a renewed interest in R&B led to some of Brown's early songs being released on European albums. At the urging of Bob Margolin, former guitarist for Muddy Waters's band and a fan of Brown, Brown returned to the music industry, beginning with a successful tour of Scandinavia in 1983. In 1984, 14 years since his last recording, Brown signed with Landslide Records and released the album Tore Up with The Heartfixers. Other recordings followed. Brown's Savoy Records hit, ""Piddly Patter"" was featured in the John Waters film, Cry-Baby, starring Johnny Depp.
