"Son of the comic comedian Pierre Desrosiers and brother of singers André Fontaine and Édouard Desrosiers, Jacques Desrosiers begins in 1956 as imitator and cabaret artist on CBC/Radio-Canada television. He soon presents his shows, mixing fanciful songs, parodies and imitations, in the cabarets of Quebec, particularly at the Montreal Casa Loma. Some of his parodies, such as La Java à Lumina, Le Peddler and La Machine à laver make the hit parade. In 1963-1964 he participates in a review called Zéro de conduite with Dominique Michel, Denise Filiatrault and Donald Lautrec, then in Clémence DesRochers's musical, Le Vol rose du flamant.
