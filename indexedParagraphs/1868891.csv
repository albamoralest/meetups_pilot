""After rehearsing for a few days we recorded our first demo in Atlanta and all agreed we had something special going on. The band was formed, almost...

Things didn't work out with Mark and we tried out a bunch of other guys."" – Erik Rogers (Stereomud vocalist), PRP.

"Chaussee's style of play featured an original and exotic heavy sound, similar to ""old-school"" heavy metal – crude and unpolished, contrasting the glam-rock influences of former guitarist John 5 and the former style of the band as a whole. Mark lent a more rigid, gloomy and aggressive sound to the band. ""I thought Mark added something great and different to the tour. We haven’t had the opportunity to write songs together"" – Marilyn Manson.
