"When he was 10 years old, Asad recorded his first song, which featured on his grandfather's debut album. He had also been interested in academics and often said if not a singer, he would love to be a pilot. He joined a private institution, however, and began singing professionally after completing his F.A. He started his musical career performing ""thumri"". One of the songs that featured in almost every concert he performed was ""Insha Ji Utho"" (originally sung by his father). Asad worked for Pakistan Television for several years. Nisar Bazmi, composer and PTV producer, who died one week before him, gave him his first break, introducing the artist to the world on television.
