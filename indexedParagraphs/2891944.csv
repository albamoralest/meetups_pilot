"""And now, since January, we are sitting in the studio, writing music, and we have like 20 songs or something like that. We don't know what it is for. It's not for Hypocrisy, it's not for Pain, it's for something else. We don't know yet, we're just writing because we really have a good time writing.""In November 2020, Tägtgren left the musical project Lindemann.

"A year before the recording of his album Dancing with the Dead (2005), Tägtgren's heart stopped beating for two minutes. This event inspired him to write the album. Tägtgren is known as ""Mayor of Pärlby"" as he owns the small village in which he resides (population c. 120 people). He has been married twice; however, neither marriage lasted. He was quoted as saying, ""And my passion for music? It's hard to be in two places at the same time, and women come and women go. Music stays.""
