"On May 4, 1958, Crosby married Pat Sheehan, a Las Vegas showgirl and model who had once dated his father shortly after his mother had died. She was also Miss San Francisco of 1950, Playmate of the month of October 1958, and a part-time actress. Within days, Crosby was sued by another woman, Marilyn Miller Scott, over the paternity of her daughter, Denise Crosby.  The sensational lawsuit lasted three years and ended with Dennis being ordered to pay Scott child support and legal fees.  This and the marriage to Sheehan and other details caused deep embarrassment for both him and his father.  Although Bing Crosby died when his granddaughter was 19, the two reportedly never met.
