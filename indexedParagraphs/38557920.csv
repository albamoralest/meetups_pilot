"His biggest success proved to be Eye Level, the theme tune to the Van der Valk TV series from the early 1970s. ITV had picked the tune, which Stoeckart had written a few years earlier, from the De Wolfe catalogue. The tune, loosely based on a German/Dutch nursery rhyme  called 'Jan Hinnerk' in German, and 'Catootje' in Dutch, from the 18th century, became an instant hit with viewers and record buyers, as the recording - made by the Simon Park Orchestra - climbed to number one on the UK singles chart in 1973. The original title of the melody was 'Amsterdam'. 'Eye Level' refers to the ever-present horizon in the Low Countries, which is always ""at eye level to the beholder"".
