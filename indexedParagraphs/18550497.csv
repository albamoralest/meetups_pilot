"Marcel Bitsch (December 29, 1921, Toulouse – September 21, 2011, Paris) was a French composer, teacher and analyst. He studied at the Conservatoire de Paris and also was professor of counterpoint there. In his latter years he concentrated on teaching and analysing the music of (mostly) J. S. Bach, producing analytic scores whose page layout was designed to convey the music's structural features. Among his students are Daniel Roth and Pierre Pincemaille.
