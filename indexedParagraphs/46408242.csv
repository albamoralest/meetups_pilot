"Root is also a voice coach, teaching at the East 15 Acting School and from her home in Highgate, London. She started that career after she transitioned from male to female and acting work became harder to find. She graduated from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama with a Master of Arts in Vocal Studies. Her thesis, ""There and Back Again: Adventures in Genderland"", has since been published in the peer reviewed journal Voice and Speech Review, and she advertises voice therapy specifically for transgender people to help them ""find a voice they feel fits their gender"". In 2015 Root starred in the BBC Radio 4 drama 1977,  about the transgender popular composer Angela Morley who had become a household name to British radio audiences as Wally Stott. Written by Sarah Wooley,  it followed the year in which Morley was enlisted to complete composition of the musical soundtrack to the film Watership Down in three weeks flat.
