"Reginald Alberto Agrati Stoneham (1879 – 11 March 1942) was an Australian composer and publisher of mostly topical songs, and a musical comedy F.F.F. He was perhaps Australia's leading exponent of jazz and ragtime piano styles in the first decades of the 20th century as both composer and performer. He was also a popular accompanist and recording artist.

"He was born in Carlton, Victoria in 1879, the fifth son of musician William (c. 1833 – 25 March 1913) and Ellen Stoneham (c. 1846 – 10 February 1889) of 210 Madeline Street Carlton. In 1900 he served in the South Australian Mounted Rifles as a private trumpeter. His trade was listed as ""wood turner"". He was wounded in action at Slobet's Nek. In 1901 he married Adelaide Minnie ""Addie"" Lyons (1880–1959). They had a daughter Val Augusta Elsa Stoneham on 10 April 1902. Described as ""one of Melbourne's leading florists"", she was employed by Harris, Scarfe, Ltd., Adelaide in 1933. Stoneham is most remembered for the song ""Sleepy Seas"" and patriotic songs during World War 1, notably the popular ""Heroes of the Dardanelles"". He lived at St Kilda, Victoria from 1918. In 1920 he composed the musical comedy, F.F.F., styled as a ""mystery musical comedy"", with a book and lyrics by C. J. De Garis, was underwritten by Hugh D. McIntosh. It starred Maggie Moore and Charles H. Workman, among others. The ""mystery"" centred on the meaning of the enigmatic title, for which solutions were solicited and a prize offered. The show played at Adelaide's Prince of Wales Theatre for a successful season, followed by a week in Perth and a fortnight in Melbourne, where the ""Argus"" critic praised the songs but lambasted the play. It has not been revived.
