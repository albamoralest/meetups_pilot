"""The basics are this. My car broke down on the side of the interstate. I pulled over, put my hazards on, and got out to call for help. When I got out of the car, another car drove off the right lane and hit me at 75 mph, pinning me between both cars, then [the other car] drove away, never hitting his breaks or stopping. The injuries were severe. My left leg was shattered open, bones littered across the interstate. The back of my head split in half, the car hit me so hard I had its part number indented into my chest. That's the accident. I was in a coma. I've been on therapy ever since, and they miraculously saved my leg, putting it back together with a bunch of titanium. Although they're not sure how much better it will get, I'm grateful to still have it. I work hard at therapy in hopes of one day getting this pain under control and walking normally again. Numerous surgeries and procedures undergone, many more to go most likely, so I say my prayers every day.""Because of the severity of his injuries, Scott was unable to move within the following years and that's what he got him more into studio work.
