"Grady Martin was born in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, United States. He grew up on a farm with his oldest sister, Lois, his older brothers, June and Bill, and his parents, Claude and Bessey; and had a horse he named Trigger. His mother played the piano and encouraged his musical talent. At age 15, Martin was invited to perform regularly on WLAC-AM in Nashville, Tennessee, and made his recording debut two years later on February 15, 1946 with Curly Fox and Texas Ruby in Chicago, Illinois. That same year, he joined Paul Howard's Western swing-oriented Arkansas Cotton Pickers as half of Howard's twin guitar ensemble with Robert ""Jabbo"" Arrington and performed on the Grand Ole Opry. When Howard left, Opry newcomer Little Jimmy Dickens hired several former Cotton Pickers, including Martin, as his original Country Boys road band. He later joined Big Jeff Bess and the Radio Playboys followed by a stint with the Bailes Brothers Band.

"By 1950, Martin was a part of the rising Nashville recording scene as a studio guitarist and fiddler, and his guitar hooks propelled Red Foley's ""Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy"" and ""Birmingham Bounce"". In 1951, he signed with Decca Records with his own country-jazz band, Grady Martin and the Slew Foot Five. In addition to backing mainstream acts like Bing Crosby and Burl Ives, they began to record in their own right, with later sessions under the name Grady Martin and his Winging Strings when he introduced his twin-neck Bigsby guitar.  The band, with Hank Garland, Bob Moore, Tommy Jackson and Bud Isaacs made regular appearances on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee in the mid-1950s.

"It was as a session musician starting in the late 1950s that Martin made his greatest mark on country and rockabilly music. As a guitarist with The Nashville A-Team, he provided the guitar on the Marty Robbins hits  ""El Paso"" (1959) and ""Don't Worry"" (1961), on Roy Orbison's ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" (1964) and Lefty Frizzell's ""Saginaw, Michigan"" (1964). His guitar work was also displayed in Johnny Horton's ""The Battle of New Orleans"" (1959) and ""Honky Tonk Man"" (1956), and especially his pure rockabilly sound on ""I'm Coming Home"" (1957). He shaped countless other classics, including Brenda Lee's ""I'm Sorry"", Willie Nelson's ""On the Road Again"", Ray Price's ""For the Good Times"" and Jeanne Pruett's ""Satin Sheets"".

"Martin is credited with accidentally stumbling onto the electric guitar ""fuzz"" effect during a recording session with Robbins; his guitar was run through a faulty channel in a mixing console, generating the fuzz sound on ""Don't Worry"". In the 1960s, he played on sessions with Joan Baez, J. J. Cale and others, and played on Sammi Smith's 1971 hit, ""Help Me Make it Through the Night"", among the most successful country singles of all time. In the early 1970s, Martin played on many records by Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty, worked with Kris Kristofferson and produced the country-rock band Brush Arbor.
