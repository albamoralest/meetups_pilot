"Stokke was TNT's live keyboardist from April 1987 to 2011 and played on every TNT album from Realized Fantasies (1992) to A Farewell to Arms (2010). However, he was never a permanent TNT member. ""I'm cool with my position in TNT,"" he said in a 2010 interview, ""Some people ask me why I'm not in the pictures and why I'm not profiled. That's just the way it is, and I'm completely laidback with that. I got to experience the rockstar existence so much in 1987 and especially in 1989 and a little bit into 1992, so that dream has been realized. If I'm not upfront, that's totally cool, because I know I've been a part of all this."" He played his last concert with TNT in Umeå, Sweden on 5 March 2011. In January 2011 he found out he had cancer. Stokke died on 27 April 2011 at the age of 44. He is survived by a son.
