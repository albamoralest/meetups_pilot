"Kumiko Ōsugi (大杉久美子, Ōsugi Kumiko, born 10 July 1951) is a J-pop artist from Tokyo. In 1964 she recorded a song with Crown Records using the pseudonym Momoko Shibayama (柴山モモコ, Shibayama Momoko). The first song to be released under her real name was Attack No. 1 (アタックNo.1, Atakku Nanbā Wan), the opening theme for the Attack No. 1 anime. She went on to perform theme songs for many other anime, including Doraemon, Aim for the Ace!, Araiguma Rascal, Flanders no Inu, and Oz no Mahōtsukai.

"She is referred to by fans and the Japanese press as the ""Queen of Anime Song"" and is considered to be one of the ""Four Heavenly Kings and Queens of Anison"" (アニソン四天王), along with Ichiro Mizuki, Isao Sasaki, and Mitsuko Horie. The opening theme to Heidi, Girl of the Alps is often mis-attributed to Ōsugi. It was actually performed by Kayo Ishū ja:伊集加代, a studio singer. Ōsugi did however perform the ending theme to the series.
