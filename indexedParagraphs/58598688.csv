"Pasha is also a vocal coach in Blues, Rock, and Metal music genres and has been present as a judge in many Iranian rock festivals and competitions. In 2008, she started a vocal contest, which has since then been held in the presence of other judges such as Farshid Arabi, Homayoun Majdzadeh and others. According to Pasha, the purpose of the contest was to provide a chance for the vocalists in rock genres, especially women, who do not enjoy an equal chance when it comes to the vocals.
