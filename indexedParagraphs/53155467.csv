"He first began releasing house music under his real name Ethan Snoreck. At the same time, Snoreck had an alternative account for his trap remixes and edits. That account was previously known as Wheathin which came from his real name ""Ethan"" and few of his friends happened to say it regularly which made the name stay until he was forced to change his name to Whethan in 2016. He started producing music by 'messing around' on Garage Band on his iPad. He first became interested in music when he began rapping with his friend Trevor in 6th and 7th grade. Since then he listened to well-known musicians such as Daft Punk, Skrillex, and Deadmau5. When he was 16 years old, he was recognized as the youngest ever producer to release a record on Australian EDM label, Future Classic.
