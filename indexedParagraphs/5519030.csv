(Where could Stephen Fry be?) was a reference to British actor Stephen Fry's flight from the stage play ""Cellmates"" in 1995, when he disappeared from the United Kingdom after bad reviews. Zeca won the 2000 Latin Grammys for ""best pop album"". In 2014, his live album Calma Aí, Coração - Ao Vivo was nominated for the same award, but in the Best Música Popular Brasileira Album category, with the title song being nominated for the Best Brazilian Song category. He currently resides in São Paulo. In 2019, he received another Latin Grammy nomination for Best MPB Album, this time for O Amor no Caos. In 2021, he received another nomination in the same category, this time for the album Canções d'Além Mar.
