"Rice was born in Long Beach, California but grew up in Florida and other locations. He began playing guitar at age six, learning from his father Herb Rice. He also played alto saxophone, bassoon, and bass in his school marching band. At age 17, Rice moved from Florida to California to be a member of his brother Tony Rice's band, the Tony Rice Unit. In 1990, Rice released his all-instrumental solo album New Market Gap on the Rounder Records label with help from Rickie Simpkins (fiddle), Sammy Shelor (banjo), Ray Legere (mandolin), and Ron Rice (bass). Rice formed his own band Santa Cruz in 1995 and in 1996, released the album Picture in a Tear. Personnel included Elmer Burchett (banjo), Ricky Riddle (mandolin), Junior Sisk (guitar), and Timmy Massey (bass). Rice joined Ronnie Bowman’s band The Committee in 2003 along with Andy Hall (resonator guitar), Jeremy Garrett (fiddle), Jessie Cobb (Mandolin) Mike Anglin (bass) and Garnet Imes Bowman (harmony vocals). In 2013, Rice began touring with fellow flatpicking guitarist Richard Bennett. In 2016, Rice and Dan Menzone released the Something Out of the Blue album on the Mountain Fever Records as the Wyatt Rice and Dan Menzone Alliance. Other artists involved include Rob Ickes (dobro), Fred Carpenter (fiddle), Adam Steffey (mandolin), and Ron Rice (bass). Donna Hughes wrote the lead-off song, ""Lonesome Highway"" which was sung by Russell Moore and Dale Ann Bradley.
