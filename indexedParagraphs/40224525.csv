"Ryoko Shiraishi (白石 涼子, Shiraishi Ryōko, born September 7, 1982) is a Japanese voice actress and singer from Kashiba, Nara. She is affiliated with Aoni Production. Possessing a husky voice, Shiraishi voices young to teenage men as well as young girls and teenage women. However, in a break from tradition, one of her most famous roles is the brash and hot-headed Asuka Kazama, who is noted for speaking with a strong Osaka accent, which is one of Shiraishi's specialist skills. She was also formerly a member of the voice acting unit Drops, along with Ai Nonaka, Akemi Kanda, Tomoko Kaneda, and Mariko Kōda. Shiraishi married on September 6, 2012, but divorced in 2013.
