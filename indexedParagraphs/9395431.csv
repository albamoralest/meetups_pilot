"Singer formed New York hardcore band Crown of Thornz in 1994 with former Breakdown guitarist Mike Dijan, Dimi on drums, Steve O'Brien and Franklin Rhi on bass. In 1995, the band released their debut EP Train Yard Blues on Equal Vision Records, a dedication to Singer's younger brother David, who had committed suicide the previous year. The following year the group released Mentally Vexed. After their hiatus from 1998 to 2013, Crown of Thornz reunited at Ieperfest in Belgium and This Is Hardcore in Philadelphia, and went on a North American tour with Rancid and The Transplants.

"After Crown of Thornz, Singer decided to set a new trend with his street blend of hardcore, metal, hip hop and punk, founding a new music genre he calls thugcore, with the band Skarhead. The band consisted of Madball's guitarists Brian ""Mitts"" Daniels and Hoya Roc, former White Trash bassist Aaron ""White Owl"" Collins, Murphy's Law's and  Misfits' drummer Eric ""Goat"" Arce, and Puerto Rican Mike from District 9. Skarhead's debut Drugs, Money & Sex EP was released in 1997. The band soon signed to Victory Records for the release of the New York hardcore record Kings at Crime, which hit stores in 1999. The band also had success with their sophomore LP Drugs, Music & Sex, released in 2009. In 2011, European label I Scream Records released the album Dreams Don't Die, Skarhead's tribute to some of Singer's favorite bands from the era between 1986 and 1989.

"In 1996, Singer collaborated with Jamey Jasta to form the metalcore band Icepick, which served as a side project of Hatebreed. Along with their bandmates Derek Kerswill, Wayne Lozinak and Frank Novinec, the group remained virtually stagnant until the song ""Born to Crush You"" appeared on UFC: Ultimate Beat Downs, Vol. 1 in August 2004. Former UFC heavyweight champion Andrei Arlovski frequently uses their song ""Onward to Victory"" as his entrance music for fights. Icepick's debut album, Violent Epiphany, was released on April 18, 2006 under Jasta's record label Stillborn Records. Singer's current band is The Wilding Incident, which also features Jimmy Williams of Nausea/Maximum Penalty.
