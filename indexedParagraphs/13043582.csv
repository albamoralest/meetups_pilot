"He was born in Budapest and began his violin studies with his father, Lajos Vecsey. At the age of 8 he entered the studio of Jenő Hubay. Two years later, aged 10, he played for Joseph Joachim in Berlin (making his début at ""Beethoven Halle"" on 17 May 1903) and subsequently became known as a stellar child prodigy virtuoso.
",2,== Early life and career ==
"He became one of the pre-eminent violinists in Europe in the 1910s and 1920s, at one point touring with Béla Bartók as his piano accompanist.  Aged only 12, he became the re-dedicatee of Jean Sibelius' Violin Concerto in D minor in 1905, when the original dedicatee, Willy Burmester, refused to play the work after he was unable to appear at the premiere of the revised version, which was premiered by Karel Halíř instead.  Vecsey championed the Sibelius concerto, first performing it when he was only 13. He was the dedicatee of Hubay's Violin Concerto No.3. He also spent time composing, and wrote a number of virtuosic salon pieces for the violin.

"From 1926 until his death, he lived with his wife in Venice, at the ""Palazzo Giustinian de'Vescovi"" on Canal Grande. His career steadily faltered after the First World War, as he grew tired of constant touring and wanted to concentrate more on conducting.

",6,== Illness and death ==
"By the 1930s, he was about to embark on that dream, but it suddenly curtailed in 1935, when he became seriously ill with a pulmonary embolism that grew through much of his life. He sought medical care in Rome, where he received surgery. The operation was unsuccessful, and Vecsey succumbed to the disease at the age of 42.
