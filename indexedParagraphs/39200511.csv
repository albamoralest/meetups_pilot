"Jennifer Lee grew up in Torrance, California. She is of Korean descent.  She was parented mostly by her mother.  Her mother owned a small business. As a child Lee had her own choice in activities and played with friends, watched the television and other self-directed pastimes. Lee graduated from University of California, Irvine with a degree in business and later worked for a video game producer. Lee was classically trained as a pianist. She first started working on electronic music while in college, when she participated in workshops by Leimert Park's Project Blowed and Low End Theory.

"Lee was diagnosed with Moyamoya disease in late 2015. After undergoing two brain surgeries, she briefly lost language and comprehension skills. Once these were regained, Lee eventually began work on her 2017 album Lune Rouge, despite not being able to fully understand music. She has noted that this album was her most personal piece of work due to the difficulties she experienced prior to making it. She discusses surmounting these challenges in Vox's Netflix series, Explained (season 1, episode 20) and the Great Big Story miniseries Soundwave.
