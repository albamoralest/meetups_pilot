"Born in Syracuse, New York, Butterfield played piano at an early age when his family moved to Newark, New Jersey, where he later studied piano. In the 1930s, he regularly appeared on radio, including WOR in New York City, and played with Noble Sissle's orchestra. He made his first sound recording and reproduction in 1937 on the Variety record label. In 1938, he signed with Decca Records, for which he recorded over forty titles between 1940 and 1942, many of which were released. Butterfield was called the ""Singing Vagabond of the Keys"" by the Chicago Defender in 1939. He ""was innovative in utilizing black and white musicians together in his combo"", which included session musicians such as Jimmy Lytell (clarinet), Carmen Mastren (guitar), and Haig Stevens (bass). In 1939, Butterfield signed with Joe Davis of Beacon Records, with whom he would maintain a long-term relationship. In 1943, Butterfield was drafted, but continued to play in a group including such musicians as Slim Furness (guitar), Eugene Brooks (drums) and Lynwood Jones (upright bass), and he cut V-Discs in 1945. In 1944, he recorded eight titles for Joe Davis under the name Erskine Butterfield and his Blue Boys.

"Butterfield's ""light swing and traditional piano phrases"" resulted in some of his songs, such as ""Lovin' Man"" and ""Because Of You,"" being used in film soundtracks. After World War II, Butterfield formed a trio and toured extensively, but his music style was less successful commercially. He recorded for a number of small labels in the late 1940s, after which his recording activity dropped off. In 1956, however, he again recorded a number of titles for Joe Davis with a reformed group, Butterfield and his Blue Boys, including musicians such as Sam ""The Man"" Taylor (saxophone) and Panama Francis (drums).
