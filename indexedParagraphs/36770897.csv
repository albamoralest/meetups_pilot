"O'Donnell's grandparents were Italian migrants, Teresa and Mario Vigano, who arrived in Melbourne from Milan in 1928 to establish 'Mario's' restaurant in Exhibition Street, Melbourne, which they ran for over thirty years.  O'Donnell, with her partner Tony Knox, opened her restaurant 'Mietta's' in Brunswick Street, North Fitzroy in June 1974.  'Mietta's' moved in 1985 to Alfred Place in central Melbourne, eventually closing in 1995.

"'Mietta's' restaurant had also become a salon of the arts, including music. In 1995, along with her partner Tony Knox, Len Vorster, Michael Easton and Lauris Elms, O'Donnell co-founded an annual art song competition which she ran herself.  In 1996 it was named the City of Melbourne Song Recital Award.  After her death in 2001, the competition was revived in 2003, as the Mietta Song Recital Award.  Since 2004 it has been held every two years.  It is now known as the Mietta Song Competition.
