"In the 1960s and 1970s, Bricusse enjoyed a fruitful partnership with Anthony Newley. They wrote the musical Stop the World – I Want to Get Off (1961), which was the basis for 1966 film version. Also in collaboration with Newley, Bricusse wrote the show The Roar of the Greasepaint – The Smell of the Crowd (1965) and music for the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), based on the children's book by Roald Dahl. For the latter, they received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song Score. When he collaborated with Newley, the two men referred to themselves as the team of ""Brickman and Newburg"", with ""Newburg"" concentrating mainly on the music and ""Brickman"" on the lyrics. Ian Fraser often did their arrangements. Working solely as a lyricist, he collaborated with composer Cyril Ornadel on Pickwick (1963), based on Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers, a successful vehicle for Harry Secombe. His later collaborators included Henry Mancini (Victor/Victoria in 1982 and Tom and Jerry: The Movie in 1992) and John Williams (Hook in 1991).

"As composer and lyricist he scored the film, Doctor Dolittle (1967), which flopped at the box-office, receiving an Academy Award for Best Original Song (""Talk to the Animals""), and  Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969). Sammy Davis Jr. had hits with two songs by Bricusse, ""What Kind of Fool Am I?"" (from Stop the World - I Want to Get Off) and ""The Candy Man"" (from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory) which became a No. 1 hit. Other recording artists who recorded successful versions of his songs include Nina Simone (""Feeling Good""), Matt Monro and Frank Sinatra (""My Kind of Girl""), Shirley Bassey (""Goldfinger""), Harry Secombe (""If I Ruled the World""), Nancy Sinatra (""You Only Live Twice""), The Turtles (""A Guide for the Married Man""), Maureen McGovern (""Can You Read My Mind""), and Diana Krall (""When I Look in Your Eyes""). Bricusse partnered with George Tipton to write the opening theme of the U.S. television sitcom It's a Living. Pure Imagination: The World of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse, devised and directed by Bruce Kimmel, opened at the Pacific Resident Theatre in Venice, California, on 7 December 2013. In 2015, it went to the St James Theatre, London. On 29 October 2001, he was awarded the OBE for services to the film industry and the theatre from Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony. In 2015, he released a memoir entitled ""Pure Imagination: A Sorta-Biography,"" with a foreword by Elton John.
