"""She taught me so much about her instrument. Still humbled in her presence - as it should be!"" Hans Zimmer
",46,== Criticism ==
"""Skaila is a world-class harpist and I feel honoured to have had the privilege of working with her, and to have had her stunning performances grace so many of my scores"" Debbie Wiseman
