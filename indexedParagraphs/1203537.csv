"Lucia Cifarelli was born on September 23, 1970 in Long Island, New York. The youngest of four children, she grew up surrounded by music and art, developing a love for singing, songwriting and performing at an early age. Luciaâ€™s first vocal coach, Tanya Travers, whom she found in the Village Voice classified ads at fourteen, introduced Lucia to her first songwriting collaborator Dan Wise, who would later go on to produce such notable artists as Run-DMC, The New York Dolls, Ani Difranco, 22 Brides, John Mayor and The Scissor Sisters. Through an extensive network of songwriting collaborators, Lucia honed her songwriting chops in New York City by night, while attending high school by day.
