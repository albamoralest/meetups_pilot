"Inheriting genes from his father who is an avid audiophile, Sezairi first discovered music at the age of 5 years old. His very first song was ""Isabella"", a Malay rock song popularised by the band Search in the 90s. He soon found himself sharing the same love for music. At the age of 14, he picked up the guitar to accompany his singing. That led him to form the band Juxtapose with him as frontman. With the band, Sezairi was first able to hone his skills as a musician, as well as a songwriter. It helped prepare him for what was to come in the Singapore Idol series, a nationwide televised singing competition in 2009.
