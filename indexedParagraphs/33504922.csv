"Caputo started Life of Agony in 1989 with guitarist Joey Z. and bassist Alan Robert. Drummer Sal Abruscato was recruited soon afterwards. After signing with Roadrunner Records, they debuted with the 1993 album, River Runs Red. Shortly after the release of a third album in 1997, Caputo claimed that her heart was no longer in the type of music they performed, and left the group. After leaving the group, Caputo formed Absolute Bloom. However, the band broke up in July 1998.

"In July 2011, Caputo came out as transgender. For a while, her legal name was Keith Mina Caputo. ""When I was Keith, I certainly wouldn't allow myself to be as flowery or as vulnerable as I do now,"" said Caputo in a 2016 interview that appeared on the music website No Echo. ""I'm a fucking sissy, get over it [laughs]! I no longer have this masculinity or this manhood to protect. This is a transformation I've been dreaming of my entire life.""
