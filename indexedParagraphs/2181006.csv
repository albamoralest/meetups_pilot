"Having moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to play with Geisha, Dee joined King Diamond in 1985. He played on the King Diamond recordings Fatal Portrait (1986), Abigail (1987) and Them (1988). King Diamond himself was becoming quite popular and the musicians backing him were taking a secondary role in the writing and decision making. After the completion of the supporting tour for Them, Dee decided to leave the band as he felt that he was becoming more of a backup musician rather than an equal contributing songwriter. However, he was rehired to play session drums for the recording of the band's follow-up album, Conspiracy (1989). After completion of the album, he was replaced by Snowy Shaw.

"While King Diamond was touring with Motörhead, frontman Lemmy repeatedly asked Dee to join his band. In 1992, Dee accepted, replacing Phil ""Philthy Animal"" Taylor. On his replacement of a longstanding member, Dee said in 2006:

"""Phil Taylor was great when he was good... so I could never have filled that space. It's like when you get married and have kids; no one can take my father's place… I could never be Phil Taylor, so I had to introduce Mikkey Dee into Motörhead.""

"Dee's first gig with the band was on 30 August 1992 at Saratoga Performing Arts Center in New York. He did not have much input on that year's March ör Die album which had been recorded with Tommy Aldridge prior to Dee joining. Dee played on the band's albums Hellraiser and Hell on Earth – the soundtrack for Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth.

"Although Aldridge recorded most of the drum tracks, Dee's photo appeared on the rear album sleeve. Aldridge said that Dee could take credit for the playing but Dee declined, citing differing styles.

"Epic Records dropped the band after the soundtrack's release and the group continued recording with German label SPV. They also started a label called ""Motörhead"" which was distributed through Warner-Chappell and ZYX. Dee's first album for this label was 1993's Bastards.

"In April 2006, King Diamond reunited with Dee at a sold-out gig at Kåren in Gothenburg, Sweden. King referred to Dee as ""one of the best [drummers] of all time and that's something that has bothered us since he left.""Dee played drums for Martin ""E-Type"" Eriksson in the Swedish pre-qualification for the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 as well as on E-Type's 2003 EuroMetal Tour.

"Dee was a contestant on series 1 of Kändisdjungeln on TV4 in 2009 but was eliminated in the 15th episode. While filming, his place was filled on tour by Matt Sorum, who commented: ""I thought either Mikkey would either die in the jungle or I would die on the Motörhead tour.""Following Lemmy's death in December 2015, Dee announced that Motörhead had disbanded.

The rumor that he was a member of a Swedish National Youth Hockey team, which began with an interview on Motörhead's Stage Fright DVD, has been rebutted by Dee himself.
