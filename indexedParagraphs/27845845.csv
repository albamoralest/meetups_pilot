"Coming from a rather 'classical' background, he met Pierre Schaeffer whom he considers his 'true and only master'; Schaeffer's teachings turned Malec into one of the most important leaders of the Groupe de recherches musicales. Since then he dedicated himself to a more radical style. He received a number of awards including the Grand Prix National de Musique in 1992. He was resident in France since 1955 and taught at the Paris Conservatoire from 1972 to 1990 where he taught composers such as Édith Canat de Chizy, Denis Dufour, Philippe Hurel, Philippe Leroux and Gerard Pesson. See: List of music students by teacher: K to M#Ivo Malec.

"Malec's approach to composition which in ways is similar to that of Denis Dufour or Xenakis is the emphasis on all aspects of sound including texture, density, movement, timbre and notably sonic character and form and the use of sound objects.
