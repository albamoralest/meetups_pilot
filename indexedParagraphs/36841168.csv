"Thomas grew up listening to music from his father, who was a music fan. Prior to his father getting a Fender Stratocaster when Kyle was seven, he played on a keyboard and drum kit. According to Thomas, the Stratocaster served as a source of inspiration. Thomas never decided what he would do with his life, therefore was hesitant to attend college. After high school, Thomas wrote songs and played with bands, saying: ""I would go on tour, but I never really took it as a serious job up until a couple years ago, when I decided to really make an effort at it. It's been a real long, slow practice.""Tuff's first release was a self-made CD-R distributed by Spirit of Orr records, the majority of which consisted of rough versions of songs later released on Was Dead, King Tuff's first 'official' album. Tuff received scant publicity following the beginning of his career as King Tuff, so he moved on to other projects such as the bands Witch and Happy Birthday. ""King Tuff"" eventually began to gain popularity, leading Thomas to revert to his former stage name of King Tuff.

"King Tuff's 2008 debut album Was Dead was originally released by Tee Pee Records sister-label The Colonel. It is now considered collectable because so few were pressed. In 2013, Burger Records re-issued a Deluxe blue edition, which charted in the No. 8 position on Billboard's Heatseeker chart dated June 6.
