Ryazanov began to create films in the early 1950s. In 1955, Ivan Pyryev, then a major force in the Soviet film industry, suggested to him to begin work on his film Carnival Night. At first, Ryazanov refused, as he wanted to make ""serious films"", but then was convinced to begin, as Pyryev believed that ""anybody could shoot a melodrama, but only a few can create good comedy."" He won instant success, and began to release more films.
