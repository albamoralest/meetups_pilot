"Jeff 'Melnyk' co-runs the independent record label Gaymonkey Records. His debut album Silence received worldwide critical acclaim and fans such as the Pet Shop Boys approached Melnyk as a result to remix their hit single I'm With Stupid. Melnyk has also collaborated extensively with UK pop band Temposhark. Melnyk has remixed a number of songs for Temposhark including their cult hit Joy. In June 2007, Melnyk released a remix album called Silence Remixed which featured a Temposhark remix of Melnyk's song Me and My Muse featuring the additional vocals of lead singer Robert Diament. In 2008, Temposhark's singer appeared on Melnyk's second album Revolutions on a track called Hurricane which was inspired by the Temposhark song Knock Me Out. Melnyk has also produced four tracks for Louie Austen's 2006 album Iguana.
