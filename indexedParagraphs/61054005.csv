"Ed Case began his music career in the illegal rave scene of the late 1980s. This was followed by a stint working in hardcore and drum & bass clubs. Case however made his name in the UK garage scene of the late 1990s. He hosted a show on pirate radio, Freek FM. He released a string of underground hits, including ""Something in Your Eyes"" featuring Shelley Nelson, which peaked at 38 in the UK top 40. This track represented a dual turning point, since it was the first time Case had had a track chart, and prior, Case had only used vocal samples, and it was the first time he had worked with a live vocalist in his studio. Ed Case achieved a greater level of mainstream pop fame with his remix of Gorillaz' ""Clint Eastwood"". He selected that track to remix because the original was 'quite slow', and he thought that his best contribution could be made in the form of a more energetic version, featuring MC Sweetie Irie.
