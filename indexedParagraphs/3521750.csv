"The Oklahoma City Zoo capitalized upon the popularity of ""I Want A Hippopotamus for Christmas"" with a fundraising campaign to ""buy a hippo for Gayla"". The fund raised $3,000 (equivalent to US$29,019 in 2020), and a baby hippopotamus named Matilda was purchased and given to Peevey, which she then donated to the zoo in 1953. Matilda spent 45 years in the Oklahoma City Zoo, and then died at age 47 from a heart attack in 1998 while being transferred to the Walt Disney World's Disney's Animal Kingdom, in Orlando, Florida. Alternative-rock band Ween released a reworking of ""Are My Ears On Straight"" titled ""I'm Dancing in the Show Tonight"" on their 1997 album The Mollusk.
