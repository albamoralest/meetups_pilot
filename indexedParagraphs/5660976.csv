"Friedlander grew up in a home filled with art and music: his father is photographer Lee Friedlander, noted for the cover photographs he took for Atlantic Records. His father's fondness for R&B and jazz helped shape Friedlander's taste in music. He graduated from Columbia University in 1982. Friedlander started playing guitar at age six and added cello two years later. Apart from his work with Zorn, Friedlander has worked with Laurie Anderson, Courtney Love and Alanis Morissette, and is a member of the jazz/fusion quartet Topaz. He created the original music for the historical documentary Kingdom of David: The Saga of the Israelites.
