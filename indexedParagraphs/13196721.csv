"Helios Creed (born Barry Johnson on November 3, 1953 in Long Beach, California, United States) is an American guitarist, singer and bandleader. He first came to prominence in the mid-1970s with the San Francisco band Chrome, who were considered an early influence on industrial rock. Chrome broke up in the mid-1980s when founding member Damon Edge moved to Paris. Helios then recruited some local hard rock musicians and launched a solo career.

"Creed was born Barry Johnson in Long Beach, California, and moved to Hawaii when he was six. His brother, two years older, introduced him to psychedelic music. When he was 12, his parents bought him his first guitar, and he became a serious student of the instrument immediately. Creed has said that he invented his trademark sound while trying to replicate the sound he heard in his head while ""listening to Black Sabbath on LSD on headphones when I was a teenager"". He moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970s, where he joined Chrome.
