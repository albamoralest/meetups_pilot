"On May 29, 1999, during an interview Mercedes discussed how she got signed to No Limit, clarifying she was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, and was in her second year at Xavier University in New Orleans when No Limit group Kane & Abel saw her perform Shirley Murdock's ""As We Lay"" in a talent show. Impressed by her performance, the No Limit group invited Mercedes to join them in the studio, where she subsequently met No Limit owner Master P. The label CEO asked her to sing ""and Iâ€™ve been with them ever since"" stated Mercedes. On June 29, 1999, Mercedes would release her debut album entitled Rear End it would be released on Master P's No Limit Records; as was typical for No Limit's releases at the time, the album featured other No Limit performing artists such as Mystikal, Mac, Mia X, Silkk the Shocker and Master P.
