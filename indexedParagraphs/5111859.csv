"McClelland's follow-up album, Thumbelina's One Night Stand was released in 2006. Reviews drew attention to the eclectic nature of the album. Exclaim! Magazine described the album as ""impossible to pin down stylistically, as it segues from roots-y rock (""Passenger 24"") to country (""Taxi Ride"") to chamber pop (""Solitary Life"") to folk (a cover of Randy Newman's ""Dayton Ohio"") and blues (""Go Down Matthew"").""
