"Noh Hong-chul's television debut came on Mnet in early 2004 when he hosted the cable TV show Dr. No's Pleasure Street (닥터 노의 KIN길거리). After the success of the show, he joined the free-to-air MBC program Come to Play (놀러와) as a joint panelist. In April 2005, he became a founding member of variety show Infinite Challenge. He was featured in a commercial for the GM Daewoo Matiz. The ad showed caricatures and photos of him inserted into the hood (bonnet) and doors of his red Matiz car (nicknamed Hong car 홍카, a play on his name and the word hong which means red). Noh Hong-chul had a brief cameo in Psy's music video ""Gangnam Style"". He was shown thrusting his pelvis in his trademark lewd dance or jeojil dance (저질댄스) while standing above Psy rapping in an elevator. His seven-second appearance in the video became a worldwide ""sensation within a sensation"" and he was, separately from Psy, invited to appear on US television. He made an appearance in Psy's video ""Gentleman"" alongside the rest of the Infinite Challenge members; and in Sistar's music video, ""Touch My Body"" alongside Jung Jun-mo.
