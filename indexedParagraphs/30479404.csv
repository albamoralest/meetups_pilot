"According to one of Marcellino's books, he recognized that music was a way to tap the inner depths of the human soul, which he was now totally fascinated with. He had been living a self-centered and materialistic lifestyle focusing on making money, having fun, following his impulses, and being successful by making it big in the world. But, this still left a certain emptiness inside. ""The hippie movement made me feel there was something more important that I needed to know,"" explains Marcellino. ""I wanted to break with convention and make truth, wisdom, peace and love – as opposed to success, money, vanity and competition – the top priorities in my life.""Along the way he attempted to fill the void with 21 different approaches to lifestyle, truth, problem solving and personal growth, including most of the major and experimental forms of psychology, eastern religion, Utopianism, experimenting with drugs and alcohol, various new-age involvements, Scientology and secular-humanism. He finally found the deep fulfillment that he was looking for in Christianity in 1982. Between 1965 and 1989, Marcellino mixed his music career with time in college. He attended seven different colleges ... obtaining credits, certificates and degrees in a range of subjects, including engineering, psychology, philosophy, theology and business.
