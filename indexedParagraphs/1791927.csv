"Fontana joined a band (originally assembled by Sam Phillips) that was without a drummer.  The band included Scotty Moore (lead guitar), Bill Black (bass), and Elvis Presley (rhythm guitar). They called themselves The Blue Moon Boys. This became the band that would perform and record the vast majority of Presley's hits of the 1950s. Along with the occasional piano and backing vocals from the Jordanaires, The Blue Moon Boys played on several Elvis hits, including ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Don't Be Cruel"", and ""Jailhouse Rock"". The band toured extensively. Throughout 1956 and 1957, the band had several television appearances, which included The Ed Sullivan Show. The band broke up in 1958 and Black never played with Fontana or Presley again afterward. He died in 1965. Although the band had officially broken up, Fontana and Elvis still regularly played and recorded together throughout the 1960s. Moore would sometimes join them. In 1968, Fontana performed on the NBC television special, often referred to as Elvis' 'Comeback' Special. Stan Lynch said of Fontana: ""Armed with accuracy, power, swing, dynamics, great time and — the biggest compliment of all — simplicity whenever it was best, D.J. rocked the greatest singer and the greatest songs ... ever. He did it year after year, record after classic record. In a world of one trick ponies and lucky ""Rock Stars,"" D.J. is the real deal.""Moore and Fontana also performed together without Presley, including a 2001 recording of ""That's All Right (Mama)"" with Paul McCartney.
