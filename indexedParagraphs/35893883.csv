"Blu's career began in her native Canada, where she became a well-known member of the electronic dance music community with shows around the country. She moved to Miami in 2010 and then Los Angeles in 2013 to pursue opportunities in the larger, more established Electronic Music community. Summer 2015 marked her return to her hometown Toronto with the release of her debut album 'Relentless'

"In 2009, Sydney Blu founded her own imprint, Blu Music, on the principle of authentic, dancefloor-rich house and techno. The label quickly became a success, producing several chart-topping singles since its creation. On top of that, Sydney has released music on some of the most recognized labels in the industry including Knee Deep in Sound, Mau5trap, VIVa Music, Desert Hearts, Kerri Chandler’s Mad  Tech Records, Kevin Saunderson’s KMS Records and more. Her release ""Give It Up For Me"" on Mau5trap Recordings was one of  Beatport’s highest selling songs, earning Sydney the rank of first female electronic music producer to have a Top 10 hit on the platform.

"Sydney’s success is largely attributed to the relentless touring schedule which she’s upheld over the years. In the spring of 2010, after leaving a long time residency at Toronto’s Guvernment nightclub, Sydney landed a residency in Miami, Florida. Partnering with Opium Group, Sydney became a resident at Mansion Miami, the hottest club in South Beach at that time. Shortly thereafter, Sydney's North American performance schedule grew, headlining such major venues as Output Brooklyn NY, Pacha NYC, Stereo Montreal, Space Miami, Avalon & Exchange Los Angeles, and Beta Denver. Then in November 2011, Sydney performed at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, for the Deadmau5 Meowingtons Hax Tour before 35,000 fans. The evening went down as the largest solo headlining dance event in Canadian history. Since then, Sydney has headlined nightclubs and been on festival lineup’s all over the globe. Last year she played main stage at Electric Island Festival with Green Velvet, The Martinez Brothers, Anna, Archie Hamilton, Danny Daze, Nicole Moudaber, Rodriguez Jr, Ellen Allien, Charlotte De Witte, DJ Tennis and more. In addition, Sydney has played main stage at festivals such as Digital Dreams Toronto, Ever After Festival Waterloo, Evolve Festival Halifax, Burning Man Festival, and Ultra Music Festival Miami. Globally, Sydney Blu has enchanted crowds with performances in Europe, Brazil, Colombia, Asia, Mexico, Tunisia, Pakistan, and Egypt. Reaching even further,  Sydney also hosts 40 radio syndications worldwide, where she connects with audiences through her live mixes and curation.
