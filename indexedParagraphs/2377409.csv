"Clark was born in Santa Cruz, California. Clark produced a prominent chart hit on Motown's subsidiary label ""V.I.P."" with ""Love's Gone Bad"", which reached #105 pop, and #41 R&B in the U.S. in 1966. In Canada, the song made it to #95 on the RPM 100. In 1967, Clark released her first album entitled Soul Sounds on the Motown label. The album featured twelve songs including a rare Motown ballad called ""If You Should Walk Away"" (Berry Gordy, Jr.) which was slated for release as a single, but never was. Another notable recording was the 1967 U.K. single ""I Want To Go Back There Again"" (Berry Gordy, Jr). She recorded one more album for Motown on its newly-created rock label Weed entitled CC Rides Again (1969). The Belgian label Marginal released a CD of ""Soul Sounds"" made from the original master tapes (with unaltered mixes) and it contains the songs from Soul Sounds, 5 songs from CC Rides Again and 3 unreleased singles. A 50-track double-CD from Universal Music was released in 2005 entitled Chris Clark: The Motown Collection includes Soul Sounds, C.C. Rides Again, and many unreleased Motown recordings. A reissue and remastered version of the Soul Sounds album was released by the Reel Music label in April 2009, the first time the album was issued on CD in the U.S. Clark became famous in England as the ""white negress"" (a nickname meant as a compliment), because the six-foot platinum blonde, blue-eyed soul singer toured with fellow Motown artists, who were predominantly black.
