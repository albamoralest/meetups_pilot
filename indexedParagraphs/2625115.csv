"Francey worked as a rail yard worker and a carpenter for 20 years.  At age 45, he began a career in folk music, finding success on the folk festival circuit, where he continues to perform. Francey's experiences in working-class life strongly influenced his 1999 debut album, Torn Screen Door, which featured the songs ""Gypsy Boys"", ""Hard Steel Mill"", ""Working Poor"", and ""Torn Screen Door"", an a cappella folk harmony sung with Jenn Cianca. Other musical themes include admiration of the natural beauty of the Canadian landscape and traditional folk themes of love and loss.
