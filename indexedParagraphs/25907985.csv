"William introduced Verbeke to Damen and Aerts, and suggested they participate in the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest. They then entered the preselections with the song ""Heyah Mama"". The intention was to  make the group the Flemish version of the British all-female group ""Spice Girls"". Thus, K3 was composed of all females in their twenties, and like the Spice Girls, women in their twenties where originally the target audience. This is noticeable in their early lyrics including their first single, ""Wat ik wil"" (What I want), whose release was not very successful. Eventually, the group achieved great success with adults, but especially with children. K3 achieved success after the release of ""Heyah Mama"", and in 2002 William sold the band to Studio 100. The production company made them an even bigger success, with merchandising, film, TV series and books also being released. Aerts left the band in 2009, while Verbeke and Damen kept on. On 27, 28 and 29 May 2011, Verbeke, with K3, was a guest at De Toppers in the Johan Cruyff Arena (then known as Amsterdam ArenA). Verbeke and Damen participated to a talent show airing on VTM. Thereafter they made Josje Huisman join the band. Later it was announced that also Verbeke and Damen would leave the band. After K3's label announced that they would look for new members in late 2015, Verbeke herself helped to choose her successor in a televised competition to determine the new K3. The competition started airing in the Netherlands and Belgium in August 2015. Klaasje Meijer, Hanne Verbruggen and Marthe De Pillecyn were designated as the new K3. Verbeke was then appointed the new manager of K3 by Studio 100. After two years in this position, in June 2017 she announced that she was stepping down as manager of K3 to make more time for her family and focus on other projects.
