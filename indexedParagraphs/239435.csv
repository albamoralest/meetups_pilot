"Sweat started his musical career as a member of a Harlem band called Jamilah in 1975. With the help of Jamilah, Sweat was able to hone his craft as a lead singer by performing regionally throughout the tri-State area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The group was started by bassist Larry Peoples, guitarist Michael Samuels, and drummer Walter Bradley. After leaving the group in 1984 to begin a solo career, he sang at nightclubs throughout New York City and landed a chance to record for the independent label, Stadium Records. Sweat recorded only two tunes for Stadium, ""Lucky Seven"", and ""My Mind Is Made Up"", which was their third and fourth ever release, but on Stadium's first release, he is credited as co-writer and co-producer of ""You Are the One for Me"", the last recording ever made by the group GQ. One of GQ's original members is his uncle, Keith ""Sabu"" Crier.
