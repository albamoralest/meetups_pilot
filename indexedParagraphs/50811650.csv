"Glaspy was born in Sacramento on January 22, 1989, and grew up in Red Bluff, California. She took up the fiddle in third grade and began playing guitar and trombone in high school. At sixteen, she decided to focus exclusively on the guitar. She later received an educational grant and attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She was only able to afford to attend college for one semester, but continued to sneak into workshops and masterclasses on the campus. Glaspy eventually dropped out of college and began performing around Boston.
