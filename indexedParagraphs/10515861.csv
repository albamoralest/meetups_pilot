"A day before her death, she was in Libya where she performed a concert and she met al-Gaddafi. The same night, she sang a song based a poem written by Ali Al Keilani, and at a time where there were large tensions between Saudi and Libya. The poem had words where it criticised the corruption of the Saudi government and how they shouldn’t be in charge of Hajj in Mecca which was a large attack on the Al Saud family.
",46,== Death ==
"On November 28, 2003, the same 4 people with her in Libya were found dead. She was murdered by an unknown despite many people believing it was her husband. A team of doctors, who examined her body, released a medical report after an autopsy was complete stating that she was shot with 26 bullets all over her body and had remained alive for only 15 minutes afterward. The other three victims of the crime, Thekra's secretary was shot 22 times and her business manager received 18 bullets before passing away alongside her husband receiving 3 bullets in the mouth. Despite the medical examiner ruling the incident to be suicide, one bullet to the mouth would do the job where as it is questionable why there were three.
",47,== Death ==
"When her death was reported, her body was transported by Al-Walid Bin Talal's (Saudi prince) private plane to avoid suspicion and show “solidarity”.

"After her death, many celebrities from the Arab world flew to Tunisia and Egypt to attend her funeral. Singers who performed Thekra's songs in their concerts included Assala, Sherine, Ghada Rajab, Elissa, and Samira Said.

"Latifa did not perform any of Thekra's songs, but instead recorded a Tunisian folk song called ""Fi Al Ghorba"" and dedicated it to her; she also dedicated her Murex d'Or award for best female singer in 2003 to her, and asked them to play a tribute to Thekra instead of her.
