"From October 2012 to October 2013, Bivona was heavily involved in the Tim Timebomb project, in which Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong released a song a day for a year via his website. During the summer of 2013, the Transplants toured the US and Canada, opening for Rancid. The Rancid headlining tour was split into three legs, with the Transplants on the first two legs of the tour. For the third and final leg of the Rancid tour, the Tim Timebomb project took the Transplants' direct support spot. While Bivona played bass in Transplants, and organ, piano and guitar in Tim Timebomb, he also played organ/piano for a few Rancid songs for the extent of the tour. His band The Interrupters were opening support for the second and third legs of the tour.
