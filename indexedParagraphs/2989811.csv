"Caitlin Cary is the youngest of seven siblings (all older brothers). Her entire family was involved in music to some degree, with her parents' love for singing and her father's interest in building instruments. She had begun to play the violin at age five, but put it aside as a teenager. In addition to the violin, she also played her father's harpsichords, where she wrote some of her own songs. Cary went to college at the College of Wooster in Ohio. She began working on a degree in English. During her college time, she picked up playing the violin again, and she formed a small 'jokey' band called Garden Weasels. After graduating from the College of Wooster, she enrolled in the graduate program in creative  at North Carolina State.
