"Geoff Moore (born November 17, 1970, in Pasadena, California) is an American photographer and director based in Los Angeles, California. He has become known for creating classic cinematic imagery with contemporary innovation. He has directed and photographed ad campaigns for Coach, T-Mobile, Facebook, Diesel, among many others. He has photographed for magazines such as GQ Magazine, Elle Magazine, and Playboy, and shot such celebrities as Norman Reedus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Heidi Klum, Aaron Paul, and fellow Los Angeles artist Alex Prager. He has also directed numerous music videos for such artists as Jewel and The Cardigans. His iconic campaign for T Mobile had his work being shown on billboards in Times Square, to sides of Hollywood buildings, and everywhere in between. The TV spots were constantly on the air, from the Super Bowl to between every hit show on air.

"Moore's latest fine art show ""California Dreamin' "" took place at House Of Fangs Gallery on Melrose St. in Los Angeles and featured 55 black and white images. His last show ""Endoresement"" at KM Fine Arts in West Hollywood was called a ""Best in the Art World"" by Artnet, with worldwide press from magazines such as Esquire, Another, I-D, Interview, Vice, and others.  Moore's fine art work was also recently featured amongst the likes of Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, William Eggleston, Jeff Koons, Ed Ruscha, and others in a show curated by Flea, the Gagosian Gallery, and DLK at a show benefiting Flea's (The Red Hot Chili Peppers) music foundation the Silverlake Conservatory Of Music (2014 thru 2019). Early 2015 his work was showcased at Art CoIogne by Kaune Sposnik Gallery (Germany). Moore's work has three times been chosen by American Photo as a ""Photo of the Year"" to be a part of their prestigious permanent archive (Alex Prager/2012 , Val Keil for Playboy/2013, Sara Cummings/Serengeti Eyewear 2019). In 2011, Moore was featured in a massive outdoor art show in Hollywood with artist Alex Prager, curated by the Lucie Foundation, called ""Facing West- Fashion in the Land of Celluloid."" Qvest Magazine of Germany recently did a 16-page spread and ""conversation"" with Moore and Prager.
