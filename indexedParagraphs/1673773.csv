"In 1974, Wallace began his career as a chief engineer in his own studio in Los Angeles. After a few years of moderate success, he returned to New York City during the emergence of hip-hop in the early 1980s. Following the breakout success of the 1986 production of the Run-DMC–Aerosmith collaboration on ""Walk This Way"" with Rick Rubin, Wallace went on to work with The Cult, Slayer, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Sepultura, Nirvana, Jeff Buckley, Sonic Youth, Rage Against the Machine, Guns N' Roses, Linkin Park, Paul McCartney, and many others. In February 1999, Wallace shared a Grammy Award for  Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical with Tchad Blake and Trina Shoemaker, for their work on Sheryl Crow's album The Globe Sessions. As of May 2021, over 120 million album units had been sold worldwide that contained a credit to Wallace.
