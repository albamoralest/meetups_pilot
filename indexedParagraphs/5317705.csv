"Rose was born Richard Dean Feller in Bronaugh, Missouri, United States. On her twelfth birthday, she got her first guitar from her grandfather that was bought at a garage sale. Although it only had one string, she immediately started to tune it. Some time later, she started taking guitar lessons by hitching rides with the local mailman to a neighboring town, and, at fifteen, was playing for dances with a local band. Graduating from high school, she played lead guitar in various rock and blues groups including The Sliders in Pittsburg, Kansas, and surrounding areas. In early 1964, she went to Los Angeles to play in a band and hone her songwriting skills. Having had no particular luck, she returned home to Missouri to continue playing with local bands.
