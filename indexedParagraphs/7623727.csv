",1,== Biography and music career ==
"Mitchel Forman began studying classical piano at the age of seven. At 17 he entered the Manhattan School of Music (MSM) for three years of study and began working with bands in New York. Shortly after graduating from MSM he began touring and recording with Gerry Mulligan, playing in both Mulligan's big band and quartet, and work with Stan Getz followed. In 1980 Forman's solo career began with a piano performance at the Newport Jazz Festival. This recording became his first album, Live at Newport. In subsequent years he worked on the road with Phil Woods, Carla Bley, Mel Torm√©, and Astrud Gilberto. Forman also recorded two solo piano albums for Soul Note and toured in Europe regularly. He joined guitarist John McLaughlin for a year and a half on the road, recording and contributing to two of the band's recordings - the seminal Mahavishnu and Adventures in Radioland. Forman then joined ex-Weather Report saxophonist Wayne Shorter, touring, recording and contributing to Shorter's Phantom Navigator.
",2,== Biography and music career ==
"In 1985, Forman began leading his own band and recorded his group debut for Magenta Records (a division of Windham Hill), Train of Thought. At the same time he continued to work with other well-known jazz and music figures, including guitarist John Scofield (""Blue Matter""), Mike Stern (""Upside Downside""), Janis Siegel of The Manhattan Transfer, Dave Samuels, Diane Schuur, Gary Burton (""Reunion""), Pat Metheny, Simon Phillips, Jimmy Earl, Freddie Hubbard, saxophonist Bill Evans and Rickie Lee Jones. Forman's 1992 tribute to the late pianist Bill Evans, Now & Then, was particularly well regarded.  Most of Forman's recordings are of the fusion or jazz genre, however, 1998's Harvest Song features 15 solo piano tracks. Forman started the record label Marsis Jazz. He has led the band Metro with guitarist Chuck Loeb, has toured in a quartet with Wolfgang Haffner, been a member of the Rick Braun band, a member of BWB band, and has been featured on albums by Jeff Golub.
