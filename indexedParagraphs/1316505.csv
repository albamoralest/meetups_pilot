"Jacob was born in Metz, Lorraine on 8 May 1958. A pianist by age four, he was immersed in studying the French classics. Something of a child prodigy, Jacob had perfect pitch and natural talent. He did not discover jazz until age 10, but when he did, its improvised nature appealed to him immediately. Early influences were Dave Brubeck and Oscar Peterson. As a teen, Jacob studied under Pierre Sancan at the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris. Later, he would teach piano at the Conservatoire National de Region in Metz.
",2,== Early years ==
"In January 1983, Jacob entered Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, and won many awards as a student, including the Joe Zawinul Jazz Masters Award, Oscar Peterson Jazz Masters Award, and Down Beat ""Top Collegiate Jazz Soloist"" before graduating magna cum laude in 1985. Jacob then took a teaching position at Berklee.
",3,== Early years ==
"During his years in Boston, he formed ""Bostonian Friends"", a musical partnership with Swiss saxophonist Fritz Renold, which produced jazz recordings (""Starlight"" 1996) and classical commissions (""The 6 Cycles"" with the Thai Symphony Orchestra 1999, and ""Helvetic Suite"" 1998). Although having renounced the classical performing circuit for jazz, Jacob has maintained ties with the classical world through projects such as these commissioned works. Renold introduced Jacob to the Swiss Youth Jazz Orchestra, for which he was an arranger and educator throughout the 1990s. From 1992 to 1994, Jacob also served as Director in Residence of the ""Orchestre Regional Jazz de Lorraine"" in Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, and composed their inaugural commission.

"While still at Berklee, Jacob worked with vibraphonist Gary Burton, but left Boston to tour with Maynard Ferguson through 1992. Jacob served as performer, writer, and arranger with Ferguson's band. This led to Ferguson producing Jacob's first piano trio record, featuring John Patitucci and Peter Erskine. Sidemen for his follow-up trio project ""Time Lines"" were Steve Swallow and Adam Nussbaum. Jacob developed material with a third trio featuring Miroslav Vitouš and Bill Stewart. The first two recordings were released on Concord Records, but the later is yet to be released.

"Jacob has extensive credits as a sideman, including Phil Woods, Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Flora Purim, Airto Moreira, Terje Gewelt, Carl Saunders and others, but his most visible association has been as co-leader and pianist for Telarc recording artist Tierney Sutton.

"Initially Jacob was hired to perform on one recording with Tierney, but the group bonded musically and gave up their leader/sidemen statuses. Sutton, Trey Henry, Ray Brinker, Kevin Axt and Jacob became co-leaders of The Tierney Sutton Band. As co-leaders, they recorded eight CDs. Unsung Heroes, Blue in Green, Something Cool, Dancing in the Dark, I'm with the Band, On the Other Side, Desire and American Road. The latter four were each nominated for a Grammy Award. In 2012 Christian and The Tierney Sutton Band received two Grammy nominations for American Road, Best Jazz Vocal Album and Best Arrangement Accompanying a Vocalist.

"Jacob released three trio recordings on his own independent label WilderJazz.  The 2004 release, Styne & Mine, is a tribute to the music of Jule Styne, and reached No. 3 in the jazz radio charts. The trio then recorded Contradictions in 2006. The recording pays homage and offers another look at the original compositions of pianist Michel Petrucciani. Jacob's next trio  recording was a joint venture with Japanese label SSJ, titled Live in Japan. It was recorded live at Tokyo Tuc Jazz Club in 2008.

"In 2011 Jacob became music director for the Broadway singer Betty Buckley. His introduction to her world of Broadway was a week of sold out performances at Feinstein's nightclub in New York.
