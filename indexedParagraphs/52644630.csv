"Soon after her graduation, the young singer started attracting the interest of some publishers. In 2010 she signed a contract with the Beijing-based record label; Dongjia Entertainment, in which she would release her first album entitled ""The more lonely I am, the more I sing"" (越唱越寂寞), an album characterized by a Teen pop and R&B sound combined with some Rock and mainstream pop songs. This album featured her first hit song, ""All your wrong"" (錯錯錯) which she sang as a duo with Liù zhé, a male singer who was also signed to the same company.

After that, she increased her musical activity and released many single releases, music videos, a new studio album entitled ""Coldness"" (低溫交流) and two EPs.
