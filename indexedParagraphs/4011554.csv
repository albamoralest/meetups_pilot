"From 1950 to 1975, Méndez was a full-time soloist. At his peak he performed about 125 concerts per year. He was also very active as a recording artist. By 1940, he was in Hollywood, leading the brass section of M-G-M's studio orchestra.  He contributed to the films Flying Down to Rio and Hondo, among others.

"Méndez was legendary for his tone, range, technique and unparalleled double tonguing. His playing was characterized by a brilliant tone, wide vibrato and clean, rapid articulation. His repertoire was a mixture of classical, popular, jazz, and Mexican folk music. He contributed many arrangements and original compositions to the trumpet repertoire. His Scherzo in D minor is often heard in recitals, and has been recorded by David Hickman.

"He is regarded as the popularizer of ""La Virgen de la Macarena"", commonly known as ""the bullfighter's song"", to US audiences. Perhaps his most significant if not famous single recording, ""Moto Perpetuo"", was written in the nineteenth century by Niccolò Paganini for violin and features Mendez double-tonguing continuously for over 4 minutes while circular breathing to give the illusion that he is not taking a natural breath while playing.

"Rafael Méndez married Amor Rodriguez after meeting her in Detroit. They had twin sons, both now surgeons; Dr. Rafael G. Méndez, Jr. and Dr. Robert Méndez, and five grandchildren. Méndez suffered from serious asthma-related problems by the late 1950s which caused increasing difficulty performing at his level of performance. After an injury at a baseball game in Mexico in 1967 caused additional deterioration, he retired from performing in 1975, but continued to compose and arrange. He died at his home in Encino, California on September 15, 1981.

"Arizona State University's music building houses the 1,400 sq ft (130 m2) Rafael Méndez Library which was dedicated and opened on June 11, 1993. The library holds 300 manuscripts and almost 700 compositions and arrangements by Méndez, as well as hundreds of images, articles and recordings. It also has an online counterpart. In 2006, the Los Angeles Opera paid tribute to Rafael Mendez by performing a work based on his life. A reviewer in The Los Angeles Times believed that Mendez ""has been called the greatest trumpet player of all time.""
