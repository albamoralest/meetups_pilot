"Hiroshi Kitadani began his singing career in 1994 as a member of the musical trio called Stagger. After the band released an album through Warner Music Japan, he released a self-titled album in 1999. Shortly after, he became globally recognized for singing One Piece's popular opening theme song, ""We Are!"" Soon, he paired up with fellow musicians in the musical act Lapis Lazuli in December of the same year. The group released a mini-album before Kitadani left. In 2003, his big break came when he joined JAM Project. He debuted during the group's second live concert, but did not participate in the group's studio recording until the single ""Nageki no Rozario"" was released. From then on, Kitadani became a prominent figure in the anison industry, but he was not singing many theme songs regularly like his peers in the group. By the time of JAM Project's first world tour, his popularity rose dramatically, and he became known to fans across the globe.

In the accompanying documentary, he worked on the tracks with his friends in a small recording studio. While in the process of writing songs, he demonstrated his cooking skills, preparing meals for himself in his own apartment.
