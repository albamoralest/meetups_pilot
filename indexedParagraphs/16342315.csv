"The Hives were formed in 1993 and rose to prominence in the early 2000s as a leading group of the garage rock revival, playing garage rock influenced rock music. Dr. Matt typically plays a 1970s Fender Telecaster Bass which differs from the earlier late 1960s Telecaster bass and 1950s Precision Bass (which the Telecaster bass was basically a reissue of) in that the bass has a humbucker rather than a single coil pickup. His bass is in the band's signature white/black color combo along with a white Hiwatt amplifier; he almost always uses bass distortion and a pick. He also occasionally plays a Rickenbacker bass, as seen in the ""Hate to Say I Told You So"" music video.
