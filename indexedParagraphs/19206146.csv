"Daigo was born April 8, 1978, in Nakano, Tokyo. He lived in Ichikawa, Chiba from age 3 to the summer of third grade. He moved back to Tokyo after his grandfather, Noboru Takeshita became the Prime minister of Japan. He attended Tamagawa Gakuen. He attended Tamagawa University Department of Arts, but dropped out. He developed a love of music at a young age when he listened to the Japanese rock band Boøwy and tried to learn the classical guitar, which he immediately quit to self study the electric guitar instead. He was also a fan of B'z, a major group under Daigo's current label. He formed a cover band for them in high school. He began voice training during his third year in high school, and formed the band JZEIL, and performed at his high school festival before graduating. At that time, various visual bands were active, and blond hair, flashy makeup, and sexy costumes were trademarks. JZEIL grew in popularity and was expected to make a professional debut, but that did not occur and the band was dissolved on September 25, 2001.
