"Jackson was born on June 16, 1965, in Carthage, Missouri, and brought up in Denver. Growing up, his parents both were fans of jazz, exposing him to the music of Ahmad Jamal, Sonny Stitt, Dexter Gordon, and Charlie Parker. Javon first wanted to play drums but his father thought those were too loud after trying out the trumpet Jackson finally selected the alto saxophone at age 10. At the age of 16, he changed to tenor saxophone and in his teens, he was taught by pianist Billy Wallace. He was briefly enrolled at the University of Denver, before spending part of 1985–86 at the Berklee College of Music, which he abandoned to join drummer Art Blakey's band in which he played alongside pianist Benny Green, trumpeter Philip Harper, trombonist Robin Eubanks, and bassist Peter Washington. Jackson was the Jazz Messenger saxophonist until Blakey's death in 1990.
