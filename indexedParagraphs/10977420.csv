"Argüelles was born in Crowborough, East Sussex and raised in Birmingham. From the age of 16, when he became the house drummer at Ronnie Scott's, through his seminal work as a founder of the 1980s group Loose Tubes, and his work with Django Bates in the early Human Chain, he has shown an innovation beyond the usual role of the drummer. Argüelles has collaborated with folk singer Corin Curschellas and John Wolf Brennan of Switzerland and with Nguyên Lê. He also plays in a trio with Benoît Delbecq and Noël Akchoté : The Recyclers. With Benoit Delbecq and electric bassist Christophe Minck, he also played with the French male pop singer Katerine on two albums; Les Créatures (1999) and Huitième Ciel (2002), and a lot of concerts in Europe.
