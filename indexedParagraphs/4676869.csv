Nordström is one of the leading melodic death metal and power metal producers in Sweden, and has worked with some of said genres' top acts, including At the Gates, Arch Enemy, Nightrage, Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, Soilwork, Opeth,  and Powerwolf. Fascinated by technology from a young age, Nordström opened a small recording studio in Gothenburg, Sweden, mainly to record his own music. The studio evolved into Studio Fredman, one of the leading Swedish recording studios where he works with his employee Henrik Udd.
