"On her latest album Rocks And Straws (2015) we are given the home reversion of a journey that began in 1986 with Bel Canto. During the journey, it became increasingly clearer to Drecker where she comes from, and the music she creates is the result of this Nordic arctic acoustic landscape, with influences of music from all around the world. She has composed the music with lyrics based on poems by the Northern Norwegian poet Arvid Hanssen. At the Vossajazz festival 2015, Drecker performed the tune ""Little Tree"" from this album, with her daughter Luna (b. 2006).
