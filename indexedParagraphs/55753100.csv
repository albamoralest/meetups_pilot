"The sisters first published CD recording, Fantasy, was described by the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs as ""delightful and generous, ...plenty of virtuosity and, ... especially enjoyable transcriptions; both the Sleeping Beauty Suite and the Polovtsian Dances are sparkling examples"". The second recording, Reflections was the Classic FM Critic's Choice. It was described as catching ""... the shimmering tone colours of Ravel's Introduction and Allegro to perfection. No less impressive was Fauré's Dolly Suite"". Their third recording, La Danse, was selected in HMV's Top 49 CDs. Gramophone Magazine described it as ""a delightful record, ... scintillating in their two-piano and piano-duet format, ... totally winning without any preciosity or self-consciousness.""
