"Hawkes's most notable involvement is with The Cars. Hawkes pushed the limits of available technology and sequencing helping to forge the sound of the 1980s. While The Cars were known commercially as a rock and new wave band, he had the biggest impact on the synth-pop and new wave sound of the Cars hits such as ""Drive."" His signature sounds include the Prophet-5 ""sync"" sound heard on ""Let's Go"" and ""Hello Again"" as well as arpeggiated and syncopated synth lines such as on ""Shake it Up"" and ""Heartbeat City.""
