"This is really a continuation of all of the things I have been doing with music for the past 25 years. It was finally time to open my own shop and set up a mastering room that catered to the music business as it exists today. Cost conscious Major labels and the growing trend of independently produced mass-market music - that's where the next generation of music will emerge.

Hull also said that he planned ""an enthusiastic re-dedication to the 'excellent customer service, spread around multiple rooms' that characterized Masterdisk in the 1970s and 80s.""Other albums Scott Hull has mastered:
