"Born John Dadzie, he grew up in South Los Angeles, the youngest of four children. He was first introduced to the electronic music scene in high school. After forming Imperial Recordings with DJ Lith, he launched his production skills on his own terms, originally producing drum and bass under the alias Infiltrata. In 2006, he decided that he was going to make dubstep. It was then that his new alias 12th Planet was created, in reference to Zecharia Sitchin's book, 12th Planet. All production under the name 12th Planet is original. As one of the first individuals to bring the dubstep culture to America (in one of the USA's electronic meccas, Los Angeles) 12th Planet has frequently been cited as the General of the Riddim Gang.12th Planet worked frequently with Orange County producer Flinch and LA Local Skrillex (on tracks ""Needed Change"" And ""Burst"" Along with Kill The Noise). He has also collaborated with various dubstep producers including Datsik, Doctor P, Plastician, Virtual Riot and Skream. Many well-known dubstep DJs (such as Rusko, Skream, Skrillex and more) use 12th Planet's productions and remixes in their live DJ sets. As a DJ, 12th Planet has toured globally in London, Sydney, Auckland, and across the US. He has also played at many American dance festivals such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Together As One, SXSW, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Ultra Music Festival, Nocturnal, and Beyond Wonderland. He is represented by AM Only, one of the largest agencies in the electronic music industry. In 2007, 12th Planet helped in the re-launch and re-branding of SMOG Records, which was previously an event production company, and has since been its head. In 2009, 12th Planet was listed as one of URB.com's ""Next 100"", and had a special feature in their 25 Now! supplemental issue. 2010 marked the release of his music video for ""Reasons"", presented by Scion A/V, which was premiered and cycled on MTV 2. Diplo's label Mad Decent included 12th Planet's remix of Little Jinder's ""Youth Blood"" on their dubstep compilation ""Blow Your Head"", released in November. 12th Planet has also been described by Skrillex as Skrillex's Mentor at a show at Ultra Music
