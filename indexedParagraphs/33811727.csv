"Prior to his work in the film and television sound industry, Pritchett played drums, but eventually opened a recording studio with a friend. This work allowed him to transition to freelance sound engineering. His place in the field of film sound was best solidified by his early collaborations with director Robert Altman. Pritchett worked on a total of seven projects with Altman, prior to the latter's death in 2006.
