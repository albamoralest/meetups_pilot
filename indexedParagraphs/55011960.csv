"Wilborn was raised in Austin, Texas. He first played banjo, but because so many of his friends also preferred the banjo, Wilborn learned to play the bass. In 1981, Wilborn met Lynn Morris at a jam session in Austin. In 1982, when the bassist position opened in Morris's Pennsylvania band Whetstone Run, Wilborn took the job. Besides Morris and Wilborn, the band included Lee Olsen (mandolin) and Mike Gorrell (guitar). Wilborn stayed with Whetstone Run until 1986. In 1986, Wilborn spent several months playing in Jimmy Martin's Sunny Mountain Boys. Then he received an invitation to join the Johnson Mountain Boys, replacing bassist Larry Robbins.
