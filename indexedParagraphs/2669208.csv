"John Rich was born in Amarillo, Texas; the son of Jim, a Baptist preacher, and Judy Overton Rich.  John graduated from Dickson County Senior High in Dickson, Tennessee and after graduation moved to Nashville where he worked as a singer at Opryland USA. He wanted to be a professional team roper. Not long after, he met up with the group Texasee, which eventually changed its name to Lonestar.

"In 2020, Rich made headlines when he accused the Lipscomb Academy Dean of Intercultural Development Brittany Paschall  of racist ""indoctrination"". Students at the school were assigned to read the essay ""Whose Story Is It?"" which mentions white privilege. This essay was written by Laurie Halse Anderson, a white woman. Rich, a white man, claimed the essay could harm white children and claimed ""racism does not exist at this school based on my experience there.""
