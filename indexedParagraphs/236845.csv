"The veteran Marxist leader N. Sankaraiah, has described Sevasadanam as an ""unusual film"" for choosing the subject of marriages between young girls and old men (which had social sanction). According to him, the film successfully broughtout the ""sufferings of the girl"" (acted by M.S.) and the ""mental agony of the aged husband"".(acted by F.G. Natesa Iyer). Tamil film critic and historian Aranthai Narayanan observes in his bookThamizh Cinemavin Kathai (The Story of Tamil Cinema) that ""Seva Sadhanam proved a turning point in the history of Tamil cinema. In the climax, the aged husband, now a totally changed man, was shown as casting aside with utter contempt his 'sacred thread', which symbolises his Brahmin superiority. It came as a stunning blow to the then Brahmin orthodoxy.""MS Subbulakshmi also played the male role of Narada in Savitri (1941) to raise money for launching Kalki, her husband's nationalist Tamil weekly. Her title role of the Rajasthani saint-poetess Meera in the eponymous 1945 film gave her national prominence. This movie was re-made in Hindi in 1947.
