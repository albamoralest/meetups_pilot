"Dave was born in Amsterdam. His father was Jewish and an English teacher by trade; his mother was a classical dancer. He has two brothers, Marteen and Lucas, and a sister, Elsbeth. He learned how to play guitar at 14 years of age. He became a very spiritual person who prayed frequently and even planned to study theology; however, he eventually chose to study law.

"Among other things, he was inspired by Jack Kerouac's  On the Road , a revolutionary novel which incited the young people of the world to leave to learn the life on the roads, and to communicate with others. Passionate about the sea and rivers (a love which he owes to his grandfather), he left the Netherlands by boat with 1,000 guilders in his pocket (about two months' living expenses).

"In the 1980s, his popularity waned following the advent of FM radio in France. He still had an audience due to live performances and his classic hits.

He later recorded a new album entitled Toujours le même bleu, which included a title single from which enables him to hit the charts once again.
