"De Souza was born in Rio de Janeiro. American producer, composer and pianist George Duke was brought in to produce de Souza's first and second album releases for Capitol in the mid-1970s, Sweet Lucy and Don't Ask My Neighbors.  In 1979, de Souza released 'Til Tomorrow Comes, an Arthur Wright production with many of the top soul session players in Los Angeles. This recording was devoid of any jazz and was an effort to jump aboard the disco/funk bandwagon. Colors, his earlier album for Milestone, is available on CD as part of the Original Jazz Classics series from Fantasy Records.
