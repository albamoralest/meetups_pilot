"Colin Cameron Allrich (born 1982, Plymouth, Massachusetts, United States) is an American self-taught Los Angeles-based musician, remixer, audio engineer and record producer. His career began when he became part of the first wave of musicians releasing music digitally with MP3.com's launch in 1998. During these early years he was known for experimenting with meshing analog sampling and computer sequencing using Jeskola Buzz. Since then Allrich has forged a multi-genre approach to music, working out of his ""Cell Studio"" creating original compositions and remixes as heard on: FOX's Bones, MTV's The People's Choice Awards and HBO's True Blood. He has also branched out into film work, supplying a song (as his Slighter moniker) to Lionsgate Films soundtrack to Blood Out and his own scores to independent films. Allrich has worked as a remixer and producer for numerous music labels worldwide, most notably his remixes for UK labels Lost Language (Space Manoeuvers' ""Stage One"") and Adjust Recordings (Dan Welton's ""Lisopain""). His remix of ""Lisopain"" was well received by DJ Hern치n Catt치neo who included it in his ""Sequential"" mixed compilation for Renaissance Records which was distributed stateside by Thrive Records and worldwide with BMG Records.
