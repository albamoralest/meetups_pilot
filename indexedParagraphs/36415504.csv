"Mollo's first band was Crossbones, which he joined in 1981 and found some degree of success in their native Italy.  In 1986, Mollo met English producer Kit Woolven, who produced his first album in 1989, followed by a tour across Europe.  After leaving Crossbones to pursue other projects, Mollo opened his own recording studio (Damage, Inc), in Ventimiglia, Italy, where he has worked with numerous artists as a producer and engineer, including Aldo Giuntini and Lacuna Coil. During this time, Mollo continued to write and record his own music and, after being introduced to Tony Martin in 1998, released The Cage with him in 1999.  Well received by critics and the public, Mollo and Martin released two follow-up albums: The Cage 2 in 2002 and The Third Cage in 2012.  In between working with Martin, Mollo also released two albums with Glenn Hughes under the name Voodoo Hill: their self-titled debut in 2000 and Wild Seed of Mother Earth in 2004. Mollo is currently involved in Tony Martin's live band, Headless Cross. The new Headless Cross line-up played their first ever show on 27 July 2012, at The Asylum nightclub in Birmingham. The set included material from the pair's Cage albums together.
