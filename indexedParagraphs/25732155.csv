"Little Bruce began rapping in 1989 and had a feud with Mac Dre from then until 1991, where the two rappers made several diss tracks towards each other. He was signed to Sick Wid' It in 1990 and released his debut album in 1994. Before releasing it Little Bruce appeared on several Sick Wid It Records releases, including: Tryin' to Get a Buck, Federal and Down and Dirty. His debut album was released October 11, 1994 on Sick Wid It and Jive Records, titled: XXXtra Manish. The album was produced by Mike Mosley, Sam Bostic and Studio Ton, and executive produced by B-Legit and E-40. It peaked at number 60 on the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album features guest performances by Kaveo, Levitti, P-Dub and Funk Mobb (G-Note, K-1 & Mac Shawn). To promote the album, a single and a music video were released for the song, ""Mobbin' In My Old School"". After releasing his debut album, he was dropped from the label because of tensions between fellow label-mates, in 1995. Little Bruce then left the music business to pursue pimping, although he occasionally made guest appearances on other Bay Area rappers albums, including: The Hogg in Me, It Ain't 4 Play, The Hemp Museum, Mash Confusion, Rapper Gone Bad and Hempin' Ain't Easy. In 2000 he returned to the music business with his second studio album, Give It to Me Baby!. The album features guest appearances by B-Legit, Big Syke, Outlawz, Mac Shawn, Lil Italy and Miami.
