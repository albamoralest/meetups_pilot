"Lange was born in Halden. He was the second concertmaster of the Oslo Philharmonic from its beginning in 1919, and for a time he served as first concertmaster at the Christiania Theatre and National Theatre. With Ole Olsen and Edvard Grieg, he created music for Henrik Ibsen's comedy The League of Youth (premiere at the Swedish Theatre, 1901). Like Ole Olsen, Lange was a Freemason and worked as a conductor and arranger for the Freemasons Orchestra (1921–1936). In Halden he was a member of a chamber quartet together with Oscar Borg (his violin teacher in his youth), Markus Boberg, and the cellist Dupery Hamilton. Together with Peter Brynie Lindeman, Lange edited the periodical Orkestertidende—blad for musikere og musikervenner (The Orchestra Times: A Paper for Musicians and Their Friends; 1892–1894). Lange was a cofounder of the Oslo Music Teachers Association, the Norwegian Music Teachers' National Federation, and the National Federation of Norwegian Musical Artists (Norwegian: Norsk Tonekunstnersamfund). He also taught violin, theory, and harmony at the Oslo Conservatory of Music (1889–1937).
