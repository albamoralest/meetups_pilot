"Signing to Island Records through Haqq Islam's University Records imprint, the group released two successful albums, Dru Hill and Enter the Dru, before separating for a period from late 1999 to 2002, during which time Sisqó and Woody released solo albums. While Woody's Soul Music LP was a moderate success in the gospel music industry, Sisqó's debut album, Unleash the Dragon, and its hit singles, ""Thong Song"" and ""Incomplete"", were major pop successes, and established Sisqó as a household name outside Dru Hill. Sisqó's second album, Return of Dragon, did not perform as well.

"The members of Dru Hill are natives of Baltimore. The group became known getting jobs at The Fudgery, a local fudge factory at Harborplace at Baltimore's Inner Harbor, beginning a store tradition of singing and performing to entertain guests while making fudge. The group's name comes from Baltimore's Druid Hill Park, which is commonly shortened in the local vernacular to ""Dru Hill"".
",5,== History == | === Early career ===
"Between their first and second albums, Dru Hill contributed ""We're Not Making Love No More"", a number 2 R&B and number 13 pop hit, to the Soul Food soundtrack. ""We're Not Making Love No More"" was written and produced by producer Babyface. Dru Hill and rapper Foxy Brown recorded ""Big Bad Mama"", a remake of Carl Carlton's 1981 hit ""She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)"", which was the main single for the soundtrack to the 1997 Bill Bellamy film Def Jam's How to Be a Player. The group was also instrumental in writing and producing for new University artist Mýa, whose first two singles ""It's All About Me"" and ""Movin' On"", were co-written by Sisqó, who also performs guest vocals on ""It's All About Me"". In 1997, Dru Hill filed a lawsuit against Island Records, seeking a release from its contract, after an Island employee hit one of the group's managers, Keith Ingram, over the head with a pool cue. It was discovered that the employee in question had a criminal record. At an October 1997 deposition hearing, Eric Kronfeld, president and chief operating officer of Island's parent company PolyGram, was asked why he had hired such an individual. His response was that if he were not to hire African-Americans with criminal records, then ""there would be virtually no African-Americans employees in our society or in our industry.""Kronfield's remarks set off a wave of controversy when word of them reached the media in November. The Reverend Jesse Jackson became personally involved, publicly stating that the Dutch-based PolyGram had ""a pattern of race and sex exclusion."" Jackson met with PolyGram chairman Alain Levy and several other executives, who issued a public apology for Kronfield's statement, and replaced Kronfield as president with Motown Records' chairman Clarence Avant. By the end of the month, Dru Hill had settled with Island Records, with the agreement that they would remain on the label.
