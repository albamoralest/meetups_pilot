"Danny Chan Pak-keung (7 September 1958 – 25 October 1993) was a Hong Kong singer, songwriter, and actor. He was among the first generation of pop idols in Hong Kong, gaining fame alongside performers Alan Tam, Anita Mui, and Leslie Cheung, who were collectively known as ""Tam Cheung Mui Chan"" (譚張梅陳) in the 1980s, predating and laying the foundation for the fame of the ""Four Heavenly Kings"" (四大天王) in the 1990s. His most renowned works include ""Tears Dropping for You"" (眼淚為你流) (1979), ""Ripples"" (漣漪) (1982), ""Just Loving You"" (偏偏喜歡你) (1983), and ""Wait"" (等) (1985), and is best remembered for his Cantopop romance ballads and high quality compositions.

"Chan subsequently signed a music contract with HK EMI, WEA, DMI, and finally moved back to Warner Music. He started singing Cantopop songs, some of which are still popular such as ""Ripples"" (漣漪), ""Just Loving You"" (偏偏喜歡你) and ""Life Expectations"" (一生何求). The song, ""Remembrance on Parents' Love"" (1981) (念親恩), is often played on radio stations and frequently chosen for karaoke.

"In 1984, he sang an English duet with American country music singer Crystal Gayle, titled ""Tell Me What Can I Do"". It was produced in US and released in US/Japan but was largely unknown due to lack of promotional budget. In the early 1980s, Chan was a host in the TV show Bang Bang. His co-operation with Leslie Cheung and Paul Chung in the films Encore (1980) (喝采) and On Trial (1981) (失業生), received positive reception from the public and media. He is the main character in HK TVB TV series Breakthrough (1982) (突破) together with his favorite female partner Mary Jean Reimer. His only comedy film Merry Christmas (1984) (聖誕快樂) was a huge box office success. He was also a main character in the film An Autumn's Tale (秋天的童話) in 1987, as Vincent (Jennifer's ex-boyfriend), with Chow Yun-fat (as Samuel Pang) and Cherie Chung (as Jennifer).

"During the span of his music career, Chan held many music concerts in Hong Kong, China, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Thailand, Canada and the United States. Chan also participated and represented Hong Kong in various music festivals such as the Nagasaki Asia Music Festival 1988 in Japan, Peace Music Concert 1988 in Singapore, Tokyo Music Festival 1989 and the Shanghai Music Festival 1991 in China. He was also invited to perform at the Seoul Korea Summer Olympics Games 1988 opening ceremony. In 1986, he performed in the presence of the Royal Thai Princess in a Thai Charity Show. In 1991, Chan announced of his decision to leave the Hong Kong music industry. He held his first farewell concert in Shanghai in Jan/Feb 1992. He has planned to hold a few more farewell concerts in US/Canada and Hong Kong but his sudden fall into coma in May 1992 halted the plan.

"Chan suffered from mild depression, which worsened during the late 1980s，and was first admitted to hospital in 1985 for anxiety. His single life led to allegations of homosexuality, which had only been decriminalized in Hong Kong in 1991. On 18 May 1992, Chan was found unconscious and he was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. It was speculated that this was due to an accidental mixing of alcohol with medicine. Chan had suffered from advanced brain damage. He went into a coma for 17 months and died on 25 October 1993 at the age of 35.
