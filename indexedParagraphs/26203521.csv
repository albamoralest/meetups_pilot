"== Biography ==
",1,== Biography ==
"A versatile musician, Josephine van Lier is equally at ease on a baroque cello or a 5 string violoncello piccolo as on their contemporary counterparts, using instruments and bows whose designs, construction and material span over 400 years in origin; from the gut strings of her baroque cello to her 1870 cello and the space-age material of her carbon fiber cello. She therefore covers a wide variety of repertoire utilizing the endless possibilities that this range of instruments, string set-ups and bows allow her. In 2010 she released a 4-CD set featuring all six suites for unaccompanied cello by Bach played on four different cellos. This unique recording sets side by side the different sounds of historic and new instruments and compares their strengths and weaknesses. Josephine van Lier appears on the concert stages in Canada, the United States and Europe as a soloist and chamber musician.
