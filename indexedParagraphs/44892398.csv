"The musical career of Brideoake began in Adelaide, South Australia, as a rhythm guitarist and vocalist in the popular Australian pop group the Twilights (1964 - 1969) which reached the peak of their success in 1966. The Twilights consisted of Frank Barnard (drums 1964-65), Brideoake (rhythm guitar, vocals), Terry Britten (lead guitar, vocals), John Bywaters (bass, vocals), Clem ""Paddy"" McCartney (lead vocals), Laurie Pryor (drums 1965-69) and Glenn Shorrock (lead vocals). The Twilights earned acclaim for their body of recorded work, coupled with their status as arguably the most polished and accomplished Australian live act of the era. Glenn Shorrock himself remembers ""Twilight Time"" as the happiest and most fulfilling experience in his long musical career. He told an online group of Little River Band fans in 1997 ""my first band, The Twilights, is the band I remember most fondly; we were very close then in a very exciting period of pop"".

"From 1975, Brideoake was a career lecturer at the Elder Conservatorium of Music in Adelaide for the next 27 years. As well as teaching in composition studies, he introduced a course in Chinese music as the result of an interest in the music, theatre and language of China. A special interest in an ancient Chinese zither (ch'in or guqin) meant that after several periods of study in China, he became a proficient performer on this instrument. In 1978, he was awarded the John Bishop Memorial Commission; other commissioned works have been composed for the Sydney String Quartet, the Australian Chamber Orchestra, the Seymour Group, the Victorian String Quartet and, more recently, by percussionist Ryszard Pusz.
