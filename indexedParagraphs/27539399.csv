"Vlahović was born in Belgrade in 1949. He graduated at the Second Belgrade Highschool and later at the Academy of Applied Arts in Belgrade. In 1968 Vlahović formed acoustic rock band Porodična Manufaktura Crnog Hleba with his sister Maja de Rado. The band released several 7-inch singles and one studio album, Stvaranje, before disbanding in 1975. During this period Vlahović also appeared in rock musical Hair performed at Atelje 212. Vlahović refused an invitation from Bora Đorđević to join Suncokret due to his army obligations. In 1976 Vlahović started working as an illustrator and cartoonist for NIN and retired from music. At the end of the 1970s he started designing album covers. In 1978 he designed a logo of the hard rock band Riblja Čorba, and in 1979 he designed a cover of their debut album Kost u grlu. The cooperation between Vlahović and Riblja Čorba continues to present day, as Vlahović designed all Riblja Čorba studio album covers, except Osmi nervni slom and Koza nostra album covers.
