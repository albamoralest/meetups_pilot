"Perkins is the son of actor Anthony Perkins (1932–1992), and photographer and actress Berry Berenson (1948–2001). He was raised in Los Angeles and Manhattan with his older brother, actor and director Oz Perkins. Perkins is a great-grandson of the fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who was a great-niece of Giovanni Schiaparelli, the Italian astronomer who believed he had discovered the supposed canals of Mars, and a nephew of the actress Marisa Berenson, Berry's sister. His paternal grandfather Osgood Perkins, was also an actor. His maternal great-grandfather was Wilhelm de Wendt de Kerlor, a theosophist and psychic medium. His mother was a great-grandniece of art expert Bernard Berenson (1865–1959), whose sister Senda (1868–1954) was an athlete and educator and one of the first two women elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame. Perkins was named after Elvis Presley, of whom his father was a fan. Perkins attended Brown University, in Providence, Rhode Island, after graduating from high school at the Harvard-Westlake School in 1994.

"Perkins took to music at an early age, briefly learning the saxophone before picking up the guitar in high school and taking lessons with Prescott Niles, one-time bassist for The Knack. While he played in rock bands, Perkins developed an interest in the classical guitar, and began to compose music in both idioms.

"In 2009, he worked with the Yellow Bird Project to create a T-shirt to raise money for the World Wildlife Fund. In the same year, on September 2, he performed an acoustic benefit concert in New York City at the Housing Works Bookstore Café to help promote the project's first publication. On February 24, 2015, Perkins released his third full-length album, I Aubade, on his newly established label MIR. It was manufactured and distributed by the music division of Isolation Network, INGrooves, and available outside the US on April 20, 2015. He toured in support of I Aubade in 2015. French indie label Microcultures released a session in October 2016 that was recorded for France Musique Radio's Label Pop, hosted by music journalist Vincent Theval. The album featured the first incarnation of his I Aubade touring band, multi-instrumentalists Mitchell Robe and Danielle Aykroyd, a songwriter who goes by the pseudonym Vera Sola. Sola credits the launch of her career to Elvis' support and encouragement. In recent years, Perkins has been collaborating with his brother, Osgood, on scores for the latter's films. The critically acclaimed score to ""Blackcoat's Daughter"" was released on DeathWaltz Recordings in March 2017. The New York Times writes: ""'The Blackcoat's Daughter' bewitches with silky-smooth camera movements and a rolling, reverberating musical score (by Elvis Perkins, the director's brother)."" Matt Fagerholm wrote of it that the score set the perfect atmospheric tone for the film.
