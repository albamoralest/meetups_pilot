"Richard Bernard Halligan (August 29, 1943 â€“ January 18, 2022) was an American musician and composer, best known as a founding member of the jazz-rock band Blood, Sweat & Tears. Halligan was born in Troy, New York.  He was BS&T's trombonist on their first album, Child Is Father to the Man, but when Al Kooper left the band after that first album, Halligan switched to keyboards and began playing flute as well. He received a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance for ""Variations On A Theme By Erik Satie"" from the album Blood, Sweat & Tears. Halligan also arranged many of the band's charts during this time period, and he wrote several songs including ""Redemption"" and ""Lisa Listen To Me."" Halligan left BS&T in 1971 after recording their fourth album, when the band began to shift to more rock-oriented music.
