"Kevin Smith (May 16, 1960 â€“ February 8, 2018), best known by his stage name Lovebug Starski, was an American MC, musician, and record producer. He began his career as a record boy in 1971 as hip-hop first appeared in the Bronx, and he eventually became a DJ at the Disco Fever club in 1978. He is one of two people who may have come up with the term ""hip-hop"". Starski claimed that he coined the phrase, while trading the two words back and forth, while improvising lines with Keef Cowboy of the Furious Five, at a farewell party for a friend who was headed into the Army.

"Starski recorded his first single, ""Positive Life,"" on the Tayster record label in 1981. (The British Group MARRS would sample this in 1987 with the No. 1 single ""Pump Up the Volume"".) Later, he recorded a song for the soundtrack of the 1986 film Rappin', which was released on Atlantic Records, before recording his first album, House Rocker, on Epic/CBS Records. This featured his most successful chart single, ""Amityville (The House on the Hill),"" a parody song named in reference to the film The Amityville Horror (itself based on alleged supernatural activities surrounding the DeFeo murder case). It was a No. 12 hit on the UK Singles Chart in 1986.  Lovebug Starski sank into cocaine dependency and was imprisoned for possession of illegal substances in 1987.
