"Cossom grew up in Orlando, Florida. An only child to a single mother - an educator and founder of a performing arts academy.  She encouraged him to perform his first solo at the age of three.  While his exposure to secular music was limited, Cossom was able to hone his skills singing in his gospel church choir.  At six, he joined his first group, a gospel act assembled by his mother and at 14, formed a short-lived singing group with friends.  From 1999-2002, Kevin fronted the Orlando-based r+b group, Nu Ground, along with Andrew (Drew) Seeley and toured all over the country.  They released an album featuring the song ""My Girl, My Boo"".  Three years later, he began to build a reputation as a songwriter and singer.

"In 2004, after a meeting with 50 Cent at his Connecticut mansion, Cossom was asked to write and record a hook for a song that G-Unit member Lloyd Banks was working on.  This resulted in ""Karma"" – a hit single on Banks’ debut album, The Hunger for More.  Though Cossom was replaced by Avant on the video and radio versions of the single, through this encounter, he received his first songwriting credit.

"After returning home, Cossom met Orlando-based hip-hop production duo, The Runners, through a mutual DJ friend.  Within a year, they asked Cossom to assist with a song they were producing for Young Jeezy's album, The Inspiration: Thug Motivation 102.  He went on to pen the hook for Jeezy's hit single ""Go Getta"" featuring R. Kelly which ultimately led to Cossom securing a publishing deal with Warner/Chappell.  Through this deal, Cossom was introduced to Grammy Award-winning producer, Danja, to write for a girl group that he was producing for.  The two developed a chemistry that led to Cossom being the first artist signed to the producer's N.A.R.S. record label.
