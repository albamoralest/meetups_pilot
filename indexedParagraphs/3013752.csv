Tino's material is released through their independent label, Tino Corp.  Another collaboration called Loop Finder General was announced at one time, but the only recording that has surfaced under this name is a track on ¡Hello Friends!, a Jack Dangers DJ mix album primarily featuring Tino material. In 1999, Dangers worked with guitarist and producer Danny Saber of Black Grape to form a project named Spontaneous Human Combustion. The project was unusual in that it was among the earliest to make and release music entirely online for free without the involvement of a music label. As a remixer and producer, Dangers has collaborated with and reworked material for David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, David Byrne, DJ Spooky, Merzbow, Depeche Mode, Coil, dubLoner, and many others. In 2021 he contributed drum programming to ""Girl Is A Gun"" by Halsey.
