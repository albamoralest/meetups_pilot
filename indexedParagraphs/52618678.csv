",2,== Career ==
"In 2015, he released his debut studio album titled 9999 in 1 via his own label Magic Trooper. He described it as a 'concept album'. He was approached by Mau5trap and was subsequently signed to the label. He debuted on Mau5trap with an extended play titled ""Murmurs"". In a tweet and Facebook post in May 2021, Mord Fustang stated that he is not affiliated with Plasmapool, citing misrepresentation. He asked fans to not buy or stream from the label due to them being ""abusive, manipulative, [lying] to their artists and [using] dirty tricks"" to keep artists with them, and stating they had been ""dragging classic tracks through the mud for years, using outdated artwork, pushing un-approved releases"", and encouraged listeners to pirate his music to get around the label. A track list was posted on in June 2021 detailing the songs he wished were no longer affiliated with Plasmapool.
