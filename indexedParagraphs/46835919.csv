"She began her career as a concert pianist but eventually moved on to jazz. She founded the Pat Moran Quartet, which later became the Pat Moran Trio, and played New York's Hickory House, the Birdland and the Blue Note concerts in Chicago. In subsequent iterations of her band, Moran performed with singer Beverly Kelly, bassist John Doling, and drummer John Whited. In the mid-1950s, she released two albums for Bethlehem Records. In April 1957, Moran's quartet performed at Birdland, accompanied by a brass section, with arrangements by Nat Pierce. Moran later released two more albums for the Audio Fidelity label: Beverly Kelly Sings with the Pat Moran Trio and the Trio album This Is Pat Moran with Scott LaFaro on bass and Gene Gammage on drums. She also performed with Mel Torm√©, Oscar Pettiford, and the Terry Gibbs Dream Band from 1959 through 1961. McCoy was featured in a book by Ray Avery (photographer) called Stars of Jazz (1998).
