"Frank Allen played bass guitar with Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers and The Searchers (since 1964 when he replaced original bass guitarist Tony Jackson), and remained with  them until they played their final gig in 2019. Allen joined Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers as rhythm guitarist in 1961, and changed over to bass guitar in early 1962, following the departure of Ben Jordan. When Tony Jackson left the Searchers in August 1964 after a string of hits (including ""Sweets for My Sweet"", ""Sugar and Spice"" and ""Needles and Pins""), Allen was asked to join the group. They then recorded ""When You Walk in the Room"",  with Mike Pender and Frank Allen singing a dual lead line. Allen wrote a book of touring recollections called Travelling Man in 1999. His definitive and detailed biography of the Searchers entitled The Searchers And Me - A History of the Legendary Sixties Hitmakers was published in April 2009. The Searchers retired the band in March 2019.
