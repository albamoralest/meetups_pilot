"Growing  up in Shetland, she enjoyed playing the piano from an early age and The Shetland Folk Festival provided early experience both of local music tradition and stagecraft.

Astrid formed the band Goya Dress in the 1990s with Terry de Castro & Simon Pearson, releasing EPs & only one album, Rooms (produced by The Velvet Underground's John Cale) in 1996 before disbanding in 1998. Since then she has released seven albums to date via her own label, Incarnation Records, Universal \ BMG and One Little Indian.
