"Catherine Bodet was born in Poissy, near Paris, the daughter of a doctor and pianist father, and a violinist mother. Catherine started playing the violin at age 5 and entered the Conservatoire de Versailles at age 11, obtaining first prize in 1958. She went on to get the 2nd prize for violin at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1965 and the first prize for chamber music in 1966. Leaving the Conservatoire, Lara started her own chamber orchestra, Les Musiciens de Paris, in which she played first violin. She then created the Lara Quartet, which accompanied singers on stage, including Claude Nougaro, Nana Mouskouri, Mireille Mathieu, and Jean Ferrat. She played on recordings by Françoise Hardy, Maxime Le Forestier, Georgette Lemaire, Jean Sablon, and Juliette Gréco, as well as writing two songs for Barbara's 1972 album Amours incestueuses.

"Since her 1979 album Coup d'feel, Lara's songs have been more influenced by rock music. This album, recorded in the town of Morin-Heights in Quebec, also saw the beginning of Lara's collaboration with French-Canadian lyricist Luc Plamondon. Jean-Pierre Ferland also contributed to the album.

"In the early 80s she wrote scores for several films such as The Rebel (1980), Men Prefer Fat Girls (1981), and La Triche (1984), and she wrote the music for the musical show Revue et corrigée, created by her friends Bob Decout and Annie Girardot in 1982. The 1983 album La Rockeuse de diamant proved a major success, with the eponymous single and the daring song ""Autonome"", in which Lara openly reveals her sexual preferences with the words ""...for a long time I thought what others thought, ...I lived as if I was someone else...for a long time I knew parallel loves...until the day when, autonomous, autonomous, free to love a woman or a man..."". This made Lara one of the first French celebrities to come out as openly gay. During an interview with Michel Denisot on the show Mon Zénith à moi, when asked what she looks for first in a man, she stated ""His wife"". Although she did not publicize it at the time, Lara dated actress Muriel Robin from 1990 to 1995.
