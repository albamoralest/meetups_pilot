"Cut Chemist became known through the Los Angeles-based rap group Unity Committee. The group merged with another group, Rebels of Rhythm, to form Jurassic 5. In 2004, Cut Chemist released The Litmus Test, which included his solo tracks, remixes, and Jurassic 5 tracks. He left Jurassic 5 in 2004. In a 2006 interview with Billboard, he stated that he had left the group in order to get his solo album finished. His first solo studio album, The Audience's Listening, was released on July 11, 2006. In 2015, it was listed by Vice as the 49th greatest dance album of all time. ""The Audience Is Listening Theme Song,"" the song from the album, has been featured in an iPod Nano advertisement. In 2010, he released a DJ mix, Sound of the Police. It was recorded using a turntable, a mixer, and a loop pedal. His second solo studio album, Die Cut, was released on March 2, 2018. It featured guest appearances from Chali 2na, Biz Markie, Mr. Lif, and Myka 9, among others.
