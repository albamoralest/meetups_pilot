"She started her performing career as Dainty Daisy Dimple and appeared in theatres and music halls under this name until February 1901 when she announced in The Era that she ‘will in future be known as Dainty Daisy Dormer’. The song which launched her career was a Charles Collins and Tom Mellor composition, “I Wouldn’t Leave My Little Wooden Hut For You” which she first sang in 1905. A pretty, waif-like presence, Dormer sang ""After the Ball is Over"" among other popular songs. ""After the Ball is Over"", which was written by Charles K. Harris, helped to establish Tin Pan Alley as a centre for the music business in the 1890s.  The sheet music sold over five million copies in the 1890s.
