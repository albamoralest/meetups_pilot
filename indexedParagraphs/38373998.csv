"At the age of four, Byington moved with her mother from Brazil to Cologne, Germany. She attended an English school until she graduated high school in 2007. In the same year, she recorded her first song, which she published on the internet. Her first single was released in January 2008 on the label Kitty-Yo. Subsequently, she joined a recently formed band called Jolly Goods on their first tour of Germany. Since 2008, Byington has been living in Berlin, Germany. Although Dillon's first recordings received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from contemporary critics, she decided to attend university to study photography before performing as a professional musician. On November 11, 2011, Dillon released her debut album This Silence Kills on the techno label BPitch Control. The album was produced by Tamer Fahri Özgenenc and Thies Mynther. Following the album's release and success, Dillon went on tour across Germany.
