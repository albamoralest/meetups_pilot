"Sylvia McNair was born in Mansfield, Ohio, the daughter of George and Marilou McNair.  As a youth, she studied violin.  She originally enrolled in the undergraduate music program at Wheaton (Ill.) College as a violin major, but was encouraged by a violin instructor there to study voice as well.  She commenced vocal studies at Wheaton with Margarita Evans, and finding herself more suited to singing, discontinued violin as her major.  She earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1978 from Wheaton and subsequently a Master of Music with Distinction in 1983 from Indiana University (whose music school is now the Jacobs School of Music), where she studied voice with Virginia MacWatters, John Wustman, and Virginia Zeani.
