"In the early 1980s, Holzman founded the Fents with Ted Hall. In 1985, he was hired by Miles Davis to play keyboards on the trumpeter's Tutu album, and stayed with him for four years, eventually becoming his musical director. He can be seen performing in the Davis concert video That's What Happened: Live in Germany 1987. In the early 1990s, he founded the band Mona Lisa Overdrive, which changed its name to Brave New World due to copyright issues. Holzman has performed as a sideman with Bob Belden, Tom Browne, Wayne Escoffery, Charles Fambrough, Anton Fig, Robben Ford, Jane Getter, Randy Hall, Ray Manzarek, Jason Miles, Marcus Miller, Michel Petrucciani, Wallace Roney, Steps Ahead, Grover Washington Jr., Lenny White, Ray Wilson, and Steven Wilson.  Many of these performers he has also produced, arranged, and composed for.
