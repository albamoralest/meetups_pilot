"Kadafi was shot and killed in Orange, New Jersey, on November 10, 1996, not quite two months after Tupac's death. Police found his body in the hallway of a friend's apartment building while responding to a report of gunfire. The friend, Roddy Beale, told his cousin Napoleon that he had accidentally shot Kadafi; he turned himself in to police and served ""7 or 8 years"" in prison. Kadafi's mother responded that it was not an accident, that Beale had threatened her son and that his family had since threatened witnesses to the threat. Kadafi is buried at Glendale Cemetery, Bloomfield.
