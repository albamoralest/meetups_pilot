"On October 24, 2011, Keiko was hospitalized and diagnosed with a subarachnoid haemorrhage. She subsequently underwent a five-hour surgery to repair the condition. As of December 2017, she is currently in rehabilitation therapy, but the prognosis seems to be good. In October 2019, it was reported that Keiko and Tetsuya Komuro were in the process of divorce mediation after revelations a year earlier of an affair with a nurse who was taking care of Keiko during her recovery from surgery. It was also reported that the revelation of this affair also prompted TK's precipitous retirement from the music industry. At present, the couple is said to be separated. In February 26, 2021, it was announced that a divorce was established with Komuro.
