",14,== Quotes ==
"“Perhaps no music evokes the notion of bass and bass tone like reggae and dub, and no two words are more synonymous with those plucking practices than Family Man.”Ali Campbell (UB40 frontman):
",15,== Quotes ==
"""There was bluebeat, rocksteady and ska. That all happened before reggae, which kind of happened in about '69, you know, when reggae as we know it was invented by the Barrett brothers, I'd say.""John Lennon (The Beatles,  discussing his plans for a comeback album in early 1980 while listening to the Bob Marley & The Wailers album Burnin'):
",16,== Quotes ==
"“In fact, if they really wanted the right sound, they should go to Jamaica! Go to the same studio that Bob Marley used! Get down with the Rasta men and smoke ganja in big spliffs or hash in chillums. Then they could get that deep-down, super funky, bass-box sound that comes from Trenchtown. You couldn't get that sound in New York. No way!""Ziggy Marley (Bob Marley's oldest son):
",17,== Quotes ==
"""I think the drum and bass, they are a very important part in Bob music. It was, you know, Family Man and Carlton, two brothers. They have their own style.""Keith Richards (The Rolling Stones):
",18,== Quotes ==
"""The first time the Wailers went to England, soon after this, I caught them by chance up in Tottenham Court Road. I thought they were pretty feeble compared to what I'd been hearing in Steer Town. But they certainly got their act together real quick. Family Man joined in on the bass, and Bob obviously had all of the stuff required.""Robbie Shakespeare (Sly & Robbie, who has been estimated to have played bass on 200,000 tracks):
",19,== Quotes ==
"""Well…what can I say? He is the man (laughter). Just the way the man plays the bass, you know. There are gun fighters and there are gun fighters, seen? I can't tell you nothing more. He is a master for me. I have had help and influences from other people, but I have to give it mostly to Family Man.""
