"Andrew Johnson (6 January 1959 â€“ 18 January 2016) was a British artist best known for designing Some Bizzare Records' record sleeves for artists The The, his brother Matt Johnson's band, in the 1980s and 1990s which were produced under the pseudonym Andy Dog. His work often featured tortured, grimacing figures coupled with dark, melancholic themes. His main medium was drawing and he consciously attempted to forge a new connection with the English Neo-Romantic movement of the early to mid 20th century.
