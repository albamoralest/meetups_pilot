"In 1998, DJ Jubilee saw Red rapping at a block party in New Orleans and signed her to his label, Take Fo' Records. She released her first album in 1999, titled ""Melpomene Block Party"". Considered the first openly gay bounce artist, Red developed a unique style of bounce, which is often referred to as sissy bounce. Her style is high energy, often employing call and response. She frequently performs and collaborates with other bounce artists, including Big Freedia, Sissy Nobby, Vockah Redu, and Cheeky Blakk. In 2011, Red, along with other New Orleans bounce artists, was the subject of an exhibition at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art entitled ""Where They At?"". The exhibition was also taken to the Abrons Art Center in New York City and the Birdhouse Gallery in Austin. Red is also a drag artist and performs under the name Keltnny Galliano.
