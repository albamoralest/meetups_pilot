"He first came to musical prominence in 1998 as a 4AD signing under the moniker Starry Smooth Hound, releasing a track co-produced by Guy Fixsen (of Too Pure band Laika) on the label sampler Anakin. Two singles, ""Pigpen"" and ""Breaking Out of Your Arms,"" preceded Miller's debut studio album  On The Block in April 2004. Two tracks included drumming contributions from Clive Deamer, whose previous credits included recordings with Portishead and Roni Size. Miller states ""Pigpen"" was first demoed using the opening drum riff from the Led Zeppelin classic recording of blues original When The Levee Breaks.
