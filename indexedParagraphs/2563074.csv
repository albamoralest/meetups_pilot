"Greg Gall (born December 29, 1965 in Tampa, Florida) is a drummer, formerly with the death metal band, Six Feet Under. He does not play the classic death metal style of drumming (blast beats). He uses more of a traditional drum approach, but with the addition of speed, and has very quick feet on the double bass pedals.
