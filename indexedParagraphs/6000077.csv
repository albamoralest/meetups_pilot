"Annie Hogan studied piano before attending Leeds University in 1979 to study politics. It was while in Leeds she met Marc Almond and Dave Ball at a local music venue. In 1980 Hogan took a year out and began djing and promoting in local clubs. Some of her first bookings were bands like Soft Cell and The Human League. Later in London she met Matt Johnson from The The who introduced her to Simon Fisher Turner who she began recording with on an album titled Deux Filles. It was this recording that began her working relationship with Almond, after he had heard Hogan playing on the album. Almond then asked her to collaborate on his solo material. Her first ever live concert was performing with an early line up of Marc and the Mambas at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The line up consisted of Hogan, Almond and Matt Johnson. After the Mambas disbanded Hogan continued to work closely with Almond, writing and performing for his solo projects Raoul and The Ruined, Marc Almond and The Willing Sinners. She co-produced her last album with Almond The Stars We Are under the name La Magia. Hogan also arranged many of the Jacques Brel songs on Almond's album Jacques; She also arranged for The Immaculate Consumptive. During this period Hogan played keyboards for Barry Adamson and also Zeke Manyika on their debut solo recordings. In 1987 she toured Italy and the UK with Paul Weller and The Style Council, playing vibraphone. In 1989 she split with Almond and founded the ambient-indie-dance band Cactus Rain. Signing to Virgin Records offshoot Ten Records the band released an album In Our Own Time, that included the singles ""Each Day"", ""Till Comes The Morning"" and ""Mystery Train"", the latter was remixed by William Orbit. In 2009 Cold Spring re-released Hogan's 1985 EP Annie Hogan Plays Kickabye. The EP was originally on Cabaret Voltaire's Doublevision label. The Kickabye EP included Marc Almond and Nick Cave recording guest vocals and Siouxsie and The Banshees drummer, Budgie, on drums and harmonica. The re-release included the unreleased follow up EP produced by Barry Adamson and early collaborations with Yello and Simon Fisher Turner. It also included four brand new solo piano recordings of Almond/Hogan songs.
