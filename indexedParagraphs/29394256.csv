"After Ricky Martin came out as gay at the end of March 2010, Ruiz claimed in a TV interview with Viviana Canosa to have kissed Martin at a party in Mexico when he was 17 and Martin was around 22. Martin was working on the TV show Muñecos de Papel in Mexico at the time. In 2014, Ruiz accused the Australian band Tame Impala of plagiarizing the song 'Océano' due to its similarities to Tame Impala's single 'Feels Like We Only Go Backwards'. Ruiz responded by saying he would consult his lawyers about possible legal action, although the accusers later claimed it was a joke. Has sold more than 4 million albums.
