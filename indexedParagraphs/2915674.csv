"His compositions received attention in the context of a 70th-birthday portrait concert given at the Purcell Room in London by the ensemble Lontano in 2004, the release of an associated CD by the same group in early 2005, and most recently by the long-awaited release of a complete commercial recording of Croquis by NMC Recordings. One writer has described his style as 'a kind of ascetically sumptuous exoticism', and has further characterised Dale Roberts' music in terms of:
",11,N/A
"the miniature form and associated possibilities of extended structuring;
",12,N/A
"reference to artists and works in other art-forms (in particular sculpture and painting);
",13,N/A
"the occasional use of quotation from other composers’ music (albeit in the context of a rather 'pure' modernist idiolect); and
",14,N/A
"a fondness for unusual instrumentations. A review of the CD recording of Croquis noted: ""Dale Roberts’s miniatures are brilliantly able to condense a familiar image, such as the reel or the fugue, and accumulate into a substantial, 54-minute statement.""
