"In her early years, Daniels studied the piano and by age 10 she began writing her own compositions. She attended Radcliffe College where she sang soprano. There she participated in the glee club as well as performing lead for numerous operettas. Along with her performance credentials, Daniels continued her composition writing and conducting two student operettas. In 1900, Daniels graduated from Radcliffe magna cum laude. Daniels studied with George Chadwick at the New England Conservatory of Music, there Chadwick encouraged Daniels to enroll in the Munich Conservatory to study under one of his old students, Ludwig Thuille. Travelling to Munich, Daniels boldly insisted on auditioning for Bernhard Stavenhagen’s score-reading class. Up until that point no woman had successfully gained admittance to the class. Daniels recalls her experience auditioning for this position in front of a class of 30 males:

"""You could have heard a pin drop, the place was so still. . . . Just as I took my seat before the keyboard, I heard one of the men smother a laugh. That settled it! I was bound to do or die, and with a calmness quite unnatural I played the bars set before me without a mistake. Nobody laughed when I had finished.""

"Returning to America, Daniels was exposed to modern choral works with orchestra. She started working as the director of Radcliffe's Glee Club and the Bradford Academy music program (1911-1913). Daniels was appointed head of the music program at Simmons from 1913-1918. Along with her career successes, Daniels established different prizes and funds for composition students studying at Radcliffe College. In 1933, Daniels was awarded an honorary degree from Tufts University, and then later, in 1939, she was given the same honors by Boston University.

"In 1913, Daniels presented her choral/orchestral work “The Desolate City, op.21.” Performed at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, Daniels gained considerable praise. For 24 summers, Daniels would return to the MacDowell Colony and eventually be inspired to write one of her best known pieces, “Deep Forest, op.34, no. 1” from 1923-33. “Deep Forest” would later be performed in Carnegie Hall (1939). The piece is well known for exemplifying her shift from Germanic compositional techniques to a “more impressionistic musical vocabulary.” Two additional pieces were written specifically for Radcliffe's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary, “Exultate Deo” and “A Psalm of Praise” respectively.
