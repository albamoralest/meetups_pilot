"Ai Nonaka (野中 藍, Nonaka Ai, born June 8, 1981) is a Japanese voice actress and singer. She works for Aoni Production and was formerly a member of the voice actor unit Drops, which included fellow voice actor Akemi Kanda, Tomoko Kaneda, Mariko Kōda, and Ryōko Shiraishi.

"Nonaka's initial interest in voice acting started after watching YuYu Hakusho. While self-proclaiming that she really would have preferred an acting career, but due to her height, as well as her interest in anime, she ultimately pursued voice acting after high school and graduated from the 21st batch of students from the Tokyo branch of Aoni's Seiyū Coaching School. In December 2009, she announced both on her blog and web radio, ""Radio Kouza Yoku Wakaru Gendai Mahou Dai Ichi"" (ラジオ講座よくわかる現代魔法第一) episode 30, that she has passed and acquired level 2 certification in aromatherapy. This was again announced while Nonaka was featured in the January 25, 2010 broadcast of Anison Plus. Nonaka has a regular column, ""Ai-pon no O'Toriyose Hyaku Sen"" (アイぽんのお取り寄せ100選), in monthly voice magazine, Seiyū Animedia (声優アニメディア). She has been featured three times in Anison Plus since the program started on July 7, 2008 (28-Jul-2008, January 26, 2009, January 25, 2010). On August 20, 2017, she announced both on her blog and YouTube channel that she married someone outside the voice acting business on August 16, 2017. On December 16, 2020, it was announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19.
