"Tuck's earliest influences as a child would involve the music his parents listened to. In particular, his father's favourite band was Status Quo who he would hear the vinyls of a lot as a little kid, as well as Bruce Springsteen's records. Tuck's main influences would go on to consist of Nirvana, Pantera, Slayer, Machine Head, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Limp Bizkit and Jimmy Eat World. However, his biggest influence growing up was Metallica, with their eponymous Black Album being the first record he ever bought after he heard the song ""Enter Sandman"" for the first time. They would also be the main reason as to why he would start to play the guitar, learning the riffs by ear; eventually paving the way for his musical career.
