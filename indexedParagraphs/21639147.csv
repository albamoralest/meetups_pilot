"Cultura Londres has been through many musical and line up changes since its conception and enjoyed a great reception from fans around the world but with Tiago's family commitments Londres was forced to shift his focus and started working on his other project Sol Invicto. With Sol Invicto now officially his main project Londres has always hinted at returning to finish the work he started in Cultura Londres. In a recent interview Londres stated ""I want to debut the true sound of Cultura, much more in tune with my roots as a musician and producer. I've always been into the heavier, darker side of music, its always been in my heart. I tried all kinds of sounds for Cultura Londres and I've ended up back where I started. It's a journey I think you have to make as an artist to truly know why you do what you do.""
