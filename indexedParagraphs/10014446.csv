"Hubbard's first band was called This Living Hand, formed with producer Clay Jones. They signed to Adam Duritz's label, E Pluribus Unum, and toured nationally with The Counting Crows and The Wallflowers. After the band split up, Hubbard went on to record three solo albums, The Slide Project, Why Men Fail, and Sing into Me. He also collaborated with Matthew Ryan to form the band Strays Don't Sleep.

"Childhood friends from Jackson, Mississippi, Hubbard and Clay Jones moved to Oxford to study literature at the University of Mississippi, where they met violinist Helena Lamb. The three began working on songs that Hubbard had written that didn't fit into their previous bands. Hubbard, Jones, and Lamb adopted the name Spoon, and recorded their first song, ""Say Something Warm"", in one day. They soon began playing live as a trio in bars, coffee houses, college lunch rooms, and restaurants.

"During that first year of shows, Spoon recorded the tracks that would make up their second album, Holding Flowers, produced and recorded by Justin Martin. They released the album on their own Lunch Pale label in the fall of 1993. The group added a rhythm section to their lineup, including Garrison Starr playing the snare and ride cymbal, and Jones picked up the bass for the quartet's live shows. Near the end of 1994, Lamb left the group, leaving Hubbard and Jones to continue through 1995 with a two-guitar, drums, and bass lineup.

"The name ""This Living Hand"" is derived from the title of a poem by John Keats. The band's songs were written by vocalist and guitarist Hubbard; guitarist Jones was responsible for arrangements and production. In the summer of 1995 the band signed with E Pluribus Unum Recordings in Los Angeles and released their first full-length album, Consolation Prize, in October, with a national tour following. The album was recorded over four days at Easley Studios in Memphis. This Living Hand recorded a second album, The TV Sounds Worried, in 1996 but it was shelved by the record label and remains unreleased to this day.

"Matthew Ryan approached Hubbard in 2004 about a collaboration. The collaboration was successful, and Strays Don't Sleep was formed with Hubbard, Brian Bequette, Billy Mercer and Steve Latanation.
",12,== Music career == | === Strays Don't Sleep ===
"In the autumn of 2005, Strays Don't Sleep's self-titled debut was released in the UK on One Little Indian. The release includes a DVD of short films that were directed and shot by professional filmmakers and friends, including Gorman Bechard, the Barnes Brothers, Martin Glenn, Matt Boyd, and Jared Johnson. Ryan and Hubbard directed three of the short films, with the help of Nashville film student Matt Riddlehoover. A 5.1 Surround Sound mix of the entire record and films, by Paul PDub Walton of Björk and Sneaker Pimps fame, is available on the DVD.
",13,== Music career == | === Strays Don't Sleep ===
"Strays Don't Sleep was released to positive reviews from Time Out, Uncut, The Sunday Express and The Times. The success helped secure a US release, which was helped further by a placement on the hit CW (former WB) drama One Tree Hill. ""For Blue Skies"", a song concerning the sentencing of Matthew Ryan's brother to 30 years in prison, was made available on the One Tree Hill soundtrack. Strays Don't Sleep toured the UK with Josh Rouse to support the album. In April 2006, their video album Strays Don't Sleep won the Grand Remi Award at the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival for Best Music Video, and the band's performance received a standing ovation. In mid-2006, the group was officially disbanded.

"The Orphan Brigade was formed in 2014 by founding members Hubbard, Ben Glover, and Joshua Britt. The group spent a year writing and recording their first album, Soundtrack to a Ghost Story, in the allegedly haunted Octagon Hall in Franklin, Kentucky. The group set out to tell the story of this eerie architectural oddity and the family, soldiers, and servants who lived and died there. They looked for inspiration and possible encounters with the spirits of this place. Additional appearances include John Prine, Kim Richey, Gretchen Peters, and Will Kimbrough.

"Hubbard's film production company, Neighborhoods Apart, produced and directed the documentary The Orphan Brigade: Soundtrack to a Ghost Story, which was nominated for Best Original Song at the Nashville Film Festival. They have since released two albums, Heart of the Cave (2017) and To the Edge of the World (2019).
