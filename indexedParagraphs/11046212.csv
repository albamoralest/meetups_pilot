"Watson's role in the band was primarily as a supporting guitarist. He typically contributed rhythmic textures (""Wonderland,"" ""Lost Patrol"") and repetitive melodic fills (""In a Big Country,"" ""Look Away"") which underpinned verses, contrasting with Stuart Adamson's more straightforward chord work in these sections. During solos, as Adamson played the main melody, Watson often contributed a counter-melody. Watson also played slide guitar on some of the band's early material, including ""Rain Dance"" and ""Red Fox."" Later on, Adamson played much of the slide guitar work on the band's songs. Watson is also an accomplished mandolin player, and put this skill to use on several of Big Country's more country and western-influenced songs, including ""Broken Heart (Thirteen Valleys).""
