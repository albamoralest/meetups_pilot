After growing up in Saintes, and studying at La Rochelle, Marry relocated to Bristol in 2003. He lived in the city for six years.

"The band's second album, Plaine Inondable, was released in 2009 on Fence Records in the UK and on Talitres in France to critical acclaim, receiving a four star review from The Scotsman. The band's third album, E Volo Love, was released in 2012 on Domino recordings, and was also positively received, with The Skinny writer Chris Buckle giving it four stars out of five and describing it as ""unabashedly romantic...a study in understatement delivered with finesse"", and Simon Price in The Independent describing it as ""gentle indie-pop jangle with echoes of Afropop"". The album received a 7/10 rating from the NME. Marry has also released several lo-fi tapes and records.
