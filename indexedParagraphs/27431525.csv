"Russom was born in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1974. With an interest in music from an early age, she spent her teenage years exploring drone and feedback using tape loops and mixers and playing in psychedelic noise bands with Michael Kelley, and with Brian Chippendale (Lightning Bolt, Mindflayer). Russom went on to study computer music, theory, composition, and improvisation at Bard College from 1994 to 1996. A growing disillusionment with traditional compositional modes along with a move to New York in 1997 opened Russom's music to more experimental forms of expression. In 1998, her collaboration with Delia Gonzalez began, a project that would lead to a number of releases on DFA.

"Russom moved to Berlin in 2004 where, inspired by that city's flourishing electronic music scene as well as Germany's history of psychedelic music, she produced three singles under the name Black Meteoric Star, which were collected and released as a self-titled LP in 2009. As of 2010, she had relocated to New York where she was producing music in various veins including in collaboration with Viva Ruiz as The Crystal Ark. Russom has also toured playing synths and percussion with LCD Soundsystem. Russom came out publicly as transgender in an exclusive interview with Britt Julious on Pitchfork and in Into, an online publication run by Grindr, with a feature interview with Nico Lang published on July 6, 2017.
