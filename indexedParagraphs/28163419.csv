"He grew up in San Diego, California, where he became a DJ in the Gaslamp district. His sets often ruined the music vibe in the clubs, earning him the nickname ""The Gaslamp Killer"". After moving to Los Angeles in 2006, he helped found Low End Theory, ""L.A.'s monolithic weekly showcase for uncut beat-driven tracks"". The Gaslamp Killer has played at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, the Austin Psych Fest, the Decibel Festival, and the Voodoo Fest. He produced Gonjasufi's debut album, A Sufi and a Killer, with Flying Lotus and Mainframe in 2010. In August 2012, he released a single, ""Flange Face"" b/w ""Seven Years of Bad Luck for Fun"", which was listed by Pitchfork as their ""Best New Track"" of July 2012. His debut album, Breakthrough, was released in September 2012. In 2015, he released a live album, The Gaslamp Killer Experience: Live in Los Angeles. In 2016, he released a studio album, Instrumentalepathy. In 2020, he released his latest album Heart Math.

"In 2017, he was accused of rape by a woman named Chelsea Tadros, who claimed he met her and another woman at the Standard Hotel in 2013, and “had non-consensual sex with both of us while we were completely incapacitated.” Bensussen replied with a $5 million defamation lawsuit. In 2019, the suit was settled with a joint statement:  ""After their discussions, Ms. Tadros acknowledges she does not know who drugged her, and both parties recognized that Ms. Tadros could have been drugged by one of the many attendees that were present on July 5th, 2013. Ms. Tadros continues to maintain that she was drugged and thereby unable to consent on July 5, 2013. Mr. Bensussen maintains that he has never drugged or raped anyone, and that he did not have any indication that Ms. Tadros was drugged or unable to consent.""
