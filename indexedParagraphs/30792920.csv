"In Germany, he joined a band in his campus, but they rarely appeared on stage. Later he decided to find a job as he lived alone there and needed to support himself. He had an opportunity to work in a supermarket, but didn't get the job, as he was too late. On the way back to his apartment on his bike, he saw a busker on the street, and asked if he could join him. The busker agreed and Sandhy borrowed his friend's guitar and started playing on the streets of Biberach an der Riss. They got 50 deutschemarks in an hour and shared the money. They played three times a week before he decided to do it alone. In 1998 he moved back to Berlin and started singing and playing the guitar in bars, clubs and in metros.

He also performed in famous theatres like the House of World Cultures in Berlin, and at music festivals such as the Bode museum isle festival.
