"Felix Laband is an electronic music artist born in 1977 in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. He creates light, emotional, minimalist soundscapes by combining several styles, and samples from classical, jazz and old television recordings overlaid with instrumental performances by himself and other guest artists.  His music has been described by his record label as 'indietronica' and is similar in some ways to Boards of Canada and Iceland's m√∫m.
