"MacDonald was born in southwest Port Hood, at the home of Angus MacDonald (Angus the Carpenter). He was raised in Judique, Inverness County on Cape Breton Island.  Known as ""Dan R."", he was encouraged by his fiddle-playing father, to study music at an early age.  His father took him to the home of Hugh A. O’Hanley in Judique South in 1921, where Angus A. MacDougall and Allan MacDougall would go to play the fiddle.  Hugh O'Hanley gave him a violin which had belonged to his brother Allan O’Hanley, MacDonald's grandfather. In 1930, MacDonald went to Glendale and learned to read music from John Willie MacEachern.

He made his first recording in 1939, including one of his own compositions called Lassies of Campbell Street.  MacDonald enlisted in the army in 1940, and served in Britain, France, Germany, and Belgium.  He regularly played on the BBC while stationed at Abergeldie Castle in Scotland.  He also met and was taught by J. Murdoch Henderson, a Scottish composer and music critic. During his time in Scotland MacDonald composed Heather Hill.

"In 1957, MacDonald left Windsor and moved to the mining town of Elliot Lake.  However, he soon had to give up his job due to failing eyesight, and he moved back to Nova Scotia in 1959.  He first settled in Sydney, where he recorded four LPs for Rodeo Records.  He spent his remaining years living in various parts of Cape Breton.  During the 1970s, he became a regular performer on the CBC Television program Ceilidh. MacDonald was a fluent speaker of Scottish Gaelic and was recorded playing and discussing his music in his native language, for Scotland's BBC Radio nan Gàidheal in 1972. He made his final public performance in July 1976, at a concert at Broad Cove.  He died on September 20, 1976 at Inverness, Nova Scotia.

In addition to the ones already mentioned, MacDonald wrote Lime Hill, Tom Rae, The Boys of the Lake, The Trip to Windsor, and Reichwall Forest.  Two published volumes of his compositions exist:  The Heather Hill Collection and The Trip To Windsor Collection.
