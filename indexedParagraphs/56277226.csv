"Peter McCord Ruth was born in Park Ridge, Illinois, US in 1949. He attended elementary school at Carpenter School, and graduated from Maine South High School in 1967. He became inspired to play the blues when he heard a Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee record. He grew up listening to Chicago blues musicians, and he often visited Maxwell Street, and attended many shows at the Regal Theater in Chicago, as well as the University of Chicago to see artists such as James Brown, Junior Walker and the All Stars, Otis Redding, Mississippi John Hurt, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Big Joe Williams, Sleepy John Estes, Yank Rachell, Robert Pete Williams, and many others, who would become a big influence on him and his music. In 1963, when he was a freshman in high school, he took guitar lessons at the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, and at the age of 14 began playing folk/blues on guitar and harmonica around the Chicago area in his first band, a duo called The Petey-Tweety Band. At age 15, Ruth began taking harmonica lessons from Big Walter Horton.

"In 1971, Ruth relocated to Ann Arbor to work full-time with New Heavenly Blue, and they recorded two albums, one for RCA Victor and another for Atlantic Records. In 1971, Dave Brubeck wrote the cantata ""Truth is Fallen"", which featured New Heavenly Blue, and was performed with various orchestras, among them the Rochester Philharmonic, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. New Heavenly Blue also played the music for a touring company performing Jesus Christ Superstar, with Madcat playing all of the saxophone parts on the harmonica. When New Heavenly Blue disbanded in 1973, Madcat joined the Darius Brubeck Ensemble, a progressive jazz group led by Chris's older brother, Darius. The group was often billed as opening act for the Dave Brubeck Quartet, and at these concerts Madcat was performing with such jazz greats as Gerry Mulligan and Paul Desmond, as well as Dave Brubeck. In 1974 when the Dave Brubeck Quartet disbanded, Dave invited Madcat to join his new group Two Generations of Brubeck, which featured Dave, and his sons Darius, Chris, and Daniel, as well as clarinetist Perry Robinson and percussionist Muruga Booker. Madcat performed with the band for the next few years, at many high-profile concerts, including an appearance at Carnegie Hall in New York City, on July 2, 1975, at the Newport Jazz Festival. In 1974, Madcat also joined Chris Brubeck's newly formed progressive rock group, Sky King. In 1975, Sky King released the album Secret Sauce, on Columbia Records, and made an extensive U.S. tour.
