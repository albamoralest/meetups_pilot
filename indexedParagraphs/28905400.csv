At the core Zee Gachette (lead vocals, drums, guitars, sounds), Nikolaj Bjerre from Denmark (drums), Mark Meilack from the UK (bass) and Diogenes Baptisttella from Brazil (lead guitar, vocals). Other UK based musicians include; Lee Spreadbury (Keys, Vocals), Sebastien Heintz (Lead Gtr) and Carly Bryant (Keys).  It has been said that the band Rock royalty, Jimmy Page and Roger Daltrey, both offered their seal of approval having caught the new sound at the Brighton Music Awards when Z-STAR picked up the best live act award presented by Psychedelic rock legend Arthur Brown. In Spring 2014, Zee launched a crowd-funding campaign through PledgeMusic to raise the funds for the production of the forthcoming album 16 Tons of Love, which is expected in 2017. Z-STAR are currently touring throughout Europe, Russia and Australia, and finishing the album mix.
