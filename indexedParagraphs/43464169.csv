"Impossible Things, Dick's debut album as bandleader, was released in November 2015 on the Chaos Collective label, which he co-founded alongside close collaborators Laura Jurd and Elliot Galvin. The album, featuring 9 young stars of the British jazz scene including vocalist/violinist Alice Zawadzki, trumpeter Laura Jurd and percussionist Felix Higginbottom and produced by Finn Peters, was lauded by numerous international reviewers including the Irish Times who said ""By turns folksy, rootsy, bluesy and indy, Impossible Things announces the arrival of a new and compelling voice in contemporary European jazz.""
