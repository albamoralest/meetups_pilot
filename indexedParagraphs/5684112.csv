"Mala's given name was Naseem Begum. She was born on 9 November 1939 in Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan. She was the younger sister of music composer Shamim Nazli. Mala was interested in singing and music from a young age. Her elder sister happened to be her first music teacher and Naseem learned the basics of music from her sister. On Shamim Nazli's request, music composer, Baba Ghulam Ahmed Chishti recorded two songs for the Punjabi film Aabroo (1961) in Mala's voice. However, the film flopped. Despite the fact that her elder sister got her a break in films, it was the film producer Anwar Kamal Pasha who persuaded Naseem to try her luck and not give up on the Pakistani film industry. Her first hit in films came in 1962. She changed her name to Mala and sang a simple Urdu composition, Aaya re dekho for the film Sooraj Mukhi (1962). The music was composed by Master Abdullah. In 1962, Mala rendered her voice to a tragic Urdu composition, Dil daeta hai ro ro duhai, kisi sey koi pyaar na karey for the film Ishq Par Zor Nahin (1962). The music was composed by Master Inayat Hussain and the song was picturised on actress Yasmin and this film song ended up being a popular song of 1962. Film song lyrics were written by Qateel Shifai. Additionally, Mala's greatest accomplishment was the film song 'Akele Na Jaana' in film Armaan (1966 film). Mala teamed up with music director Sohail Rana and film songs writer Masroor Anwar.
