"Uehara debuted in 2001 with the song ""Aoi Aoi Kono Hoshi ni"" (青い青いこの地球に) which was featured on the anime Detective Conan as its 13th ending song. Both the song and the subsequent album were highly successful. Signed up to Giza Studio, after several minor hits she was fired by her agency in 2007 as she was involved in a fraud scandal, and this was considered ""a serious breach of contract"". After a long hiatus, she resurfaced in 2012, appearing in an uncensored adult movie with the stage name of Yui Nagahara (長原ゆい) and then making the debut in the main adult video circuit with the label Muteki and using just her first name, Azumi. She left the label in 2014.
