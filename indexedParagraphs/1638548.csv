"In 1961, bandleader Eddie Palmieri heard Quintana sing in an audition and invited him to join his newly organized conjunto (small band), La Perfecta.  Quintana accepted and became the lead singer of the band between 1961 and 1973.  During this time he co-wrote some of Palmieri's major hit songs.  With Palmieri, Quintana was awarded the 1966 Trophy for the ""Most Popular Latin Singer of the Year"", awarded at the Palladium Ballroom in New York. Quintana left Palmieri for a solo career and signed with Vaya Records (subsidiary of Fania Records).  Between 1974 and 1983, he recorded five albums as a solo artist, scoring his first major hit with ""Mi Debilidad"" (""My Weakness"").
