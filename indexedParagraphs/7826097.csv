",1,== Biography ==
"Born in Lakeville, Minnesota, Ellingboe is a 1980 graduate of Saint Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota, where he received a degree in Music Theory and Composition, studying with Kenneth and Carolyn Jennings. He then attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, graduating with degrees in Vocal Performance and Choral Conducting. He has done additional study at the University of Oslo, the Aspen Music Festival, and the Vatican. From 1985 to 2015 he was on the faculty of the University of New Mexico, where he was Professor of Music and Director of Choral Activities. He also, at various times, served as Coordinator of Vocal Studies and Chair of the Department of Music, and held the honorary title of Regents Lecturer. Ellingboe is well known as a composer and arranger of choral music, with over 160 pieces in print. His ""Requiem"" for chorus and orchestra has been heard in Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center and in Prague, Bratislava, and Budapest. ""Star Song"" for chorus, tenor solo and orchestra was premiered in Lincoln Center and Great Britain in 2014.  He has won annual awards in composition from ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) since 2000. In 2019, he published A Practical Guide to Choral Conducting with the Neil A. Kjos Music Company. Ellingboe is editor of Choral Literature for Sundays and Seasons (Augsburg Fortress Press, 2004), a compendium of sacred choral music. He is also well known as an expert on the vocal music of Scandinavia, and particularly the songs of Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg (1843–1907). His editions of Grieg's songs, 45 Songs of Edvard Grieg (1988) and A Grieg Song Anthology (1990) are both published by Leyerle Publications. For his work on making the music of Norway better known among English-speaking singers, Ellingboe was awarded the Medal of St. Olav by His Majesty, King Harald of Norway, in 1994. He has curated the choral series Music for the Church Year Neil A. Kjos Music Company since 1996. In 2017 he became Acquisitions Editor for National Music Publishers. He was Composer-In-Residence for the Albany Pro Musica from 2020-2023. In 2021 his composition Welcome to Our Wondering Sight won the Weiger Lepke-Sims Family Sacred Music Award for music for harp and choir. [1]
