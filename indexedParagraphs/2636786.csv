"Pittiș had a very active life and he was loved both by his own generation and by the youth. Emblematic for his image was his long hair, his informal wear, and his habit of smoking ""Carpaţi"", a brand of filterless cigarettes. He was equally appreciated for his very particular voice, as a singer, on stage, and as a voice-over in television programs. He was called many superlative and admirative names such as ""the prophet of the blue-jeans generation"" and ""the most beautiful voice in the Romanian theater"". In the Benelux and Norway he is remembered for his role as the Parrot in the 1976 Romanian-Soviet-French co-production children musical movie ""Ma-ma"", The English title of the movie was called ""Rock'n Roll Wolf"", it aired on Dutch Television in 1980, and it is known as ""Med Grimm og Gru"" in Norway, where the film first aired in 1983.
