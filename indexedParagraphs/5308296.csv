"A teenage obsession with Greek mythology led them to adopt the stage name Daedelus—a tribute to the artist, inventor, and craftsman (spelled Daedalus). In 1999 they began DJing Dublab.com's Entropy Sessions and releasing their own early demo productions. This got the attention of Carlos Niño (of Ammoncontact), who featured Daedelus tracks on two compilations. Subsequently, Daedelus released a studio album, Invention, on Plug Research in 2002. The Household EP was released on Eastern Developments in 2003. They also released The Weather, a collaborative album with Busdriver and Radioinactive, on Mush Records that year. They released a studio album, Of Snowdonia, on Plug Research in 2004. It was followed by another solo album, A Gent Agent, on Laboratory Instinct that year. Their 2005 album, Exquisite Corpse, featured guest appearances from MF Doom, Mike Ladd, and TTC. In the following year, they released Denies the Day's Demise on Mush Records. Their 2008 album, Love to Make Music To, and 2011 album, Bespoke, were both released on Ninja Tune. They released the Righteous Fists of Harmony EP in 2010, and The Light Brigade in 2014. In 2013, they released a studio album, Drown Out, on Anticon. In 2015, they participated in the musical transmedia Soundhunters broadcast on the Franco-German channel Arte. In 2016, they released Labyrinths. In 2019, they became a faculty member of the Berklee Electronic Production and Design Department. In 2020, they were named an Artist In Residence at SETI.
