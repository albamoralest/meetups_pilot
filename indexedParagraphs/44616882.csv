"Billain was influenced as a pre-teen by the Bosnian War. During the four-year lasting Siege of Sarajevo he began to draw and later discovered graffiti and created his first hip hop productions. In search of new possibilities to express his feelings originating in the siege, at first Billain taught himself how to produce techno music and later neurofunk. Before he released his first music, Billain joined the drum and bass collective Kontra which organised many drum and bass events in Sarajevo with Djs like Matrix & Optical, Teebee, Stakka & Skynet and Konflict. His music has been played on BBC Radio 1 and has been featured on UKF Music. In 2014, Billain, alongside composer Sloven Anzulović, created and composed the sound design and music for the re-opening ceremony of the 1992 destroyed and now rebuilt National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2018, Kutkut designed sounds for the movies Pacific Rim Uprising and Hunter Killer and created the soundtrack of the horror game Scorn. Billain also releases shortfilms about technological singularity and artificial intelligence. With his side project Aethek, he drifts towards the genre of Noise music, only focusing on sound design instead of melody and rhythm.
