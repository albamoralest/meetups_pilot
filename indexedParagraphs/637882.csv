"Frank Farian (born Franz Reuther; 18 July 1941) is a German record producer, musician, singer and songwriter, who founded the 1970s disco-pop group Boney M. and the Latin pop band No Mercy. His practice of creating vocal groups in which the publicised members merely lip sync to songs sung by session members, as he did with his band Milli Vanilli, has led to controversy during his career. He owns the record label MCI and several subsidiaries. Over the course of his career, Farian has sold over 850 million records and earned 800 gold and platinum certifications.

"Farian started as a trained cook before moving into the music industry. In April 1967, he released a cover of Otis Redding's ""Mr. Pitiful"" under the name ""Frankie Farian"". In 1976, Farian's German-language cover of Dickey Lee's ""Rocky"" stayed at No. 1 for four weeks and received gold certification.

"In the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but made little impact on the popular music scene until his song ""Baby Do You Wanna Bump"" (a remake of Prince Buster's song ""Al Capone"" from 1967), released under the pseudonym Boney M., became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with ""Was kann schöner sein"", a German version of ""When You've Gotta Go"" originally by Solomon King, co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker. Shying away from the spotlight, he hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, Marcia Barrett and Liz Mitchell, who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, Bobby Farrell, was allowed to record vocals only in the 1980s. Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.

"Farian also started the supergroup Far Corporation (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured Steve Lukather, David Paich, Bobby Kimball, Simon Phillips (all from Toto fame) and Robin McAuley. Far Corporation were the first act to chart with a cover version of Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven""; their cover was a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 8 in October 1985.

"On 14 November 1990, Farian confessed to orchestrating the events leading to the Milli Vanilli scandal. As a producer, he  assembled a group of session musicians and fronted it with physically attractive dancers Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that others had sung on the albums. As soon as these details emerged, Milli Vanilli's 1990 Grammy Award for Best New Artist was revoked, and at least 27 lawsuits were filed in the United States under U.S. consumer fraud protection laws.

"Following the Milli Vanilli controversy, Farian developed similar Eurodance groups La Bouche and Le Click. He also produced the 1997 version of ""Tic, Tic Tac"" by Chilli Feat. Carrapicho. Some other groups Farian has been involved with are Eruption (whom he managed in 1977) and Latin pop band No Mercy based in Germany.

"On 15 August 2006, the musical Daddy Cool opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London's West End, featuring Michelle Collins, Michael Harvey, Javine Hylton and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened 23 April 2007 in Berlin, Germany, and toured in the Netherlands from August 2011 to February 2012, Spain (Palma de Mallorca) in July 2012, Switzerland from November 2015 to January 2016, and Germany 2016.

"In 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing the song ""Doin' Fine"" with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in the song were Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, Peter Wilson, Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a new composition featuring the string arrangement from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit ""Daddy Cool"". It was recorded by Australian pop singer Peter Wilson. It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled ""Daddy's Cool 12"" Mix"", and reached number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007. The original version of ""Doin' Fine"" was featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, Follow Me, released in the UK on 8 October 2007. It was also recorded in 2008 by Amanda Lear.
