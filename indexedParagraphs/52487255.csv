His stage name is derived from his brother's name, Ichal who died at 2 weeks old, which in turn originated from a mountain that was named after that his father grew up near in Peru, along with being closer to large Peruvian cities. He began rapping at age 12 and later started making beats and writing songs with a friend at the Museum of Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

"A. CHAL's music generally fits into the hip hop and R&B genres. USA Today has described his music as falling somewhere ""in the negative space between Hip-Hop, R&B, chillwave, and pop music."" A. CHAL himself has described his music's genre as soul. His sound has also been characterized as ""sedated"", ""hazy"", and ""almost-psychedelic"". Remezcla has called his voice ""sultry, sparse, and desperate"". Lyrically, he largely discusses anecdotal experiences. Writing about his 2016 album Welcome to GAZI, Jules Muir of Pigeons & Planes noted that A. CHAL attempts to cut ""to the core of many of society's ills and triumphs by tapping into a deep well of personal experiences and anecdotes.""
