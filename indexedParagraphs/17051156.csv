"Reuben Wu was born in Liverpool in 1975, the son of Hong Kongese immigrants. He trained in industrial design at Sheffield Hallam University, graduating in 1997. Meanwhile, he met Daniel Hunt in Liverpool in 1994; they formed Ladytron in 1999, along with Mira Aroyo and Helen Marnie. Wu finished his MSc in 1998 at the University of Liverpool. He worked as an industrial designer until going full-time with the band in 2002. Wu hand drew the artwork of the UK edition of Ladytron's first album 604 and began to document his travels on tour with the band via photography. His visual art career began in 2012 once the band took a break and he was able to focus full-time on his own creative output. Wu had since created artistic content for GE, Apple's ""Shot On iPhone"" campaign, Jaguar Land Rover, Google and Interscope amongst others. Wu and Hunt set up the Liverpool nightclubs Evol in 2003 and Korova in 2005. Wu produced and co-wrote two songs ""Birds of Prey"" and ""Little Dreamer"" for Christina Aguilera's 2010 album Bionic. In 2017, Wu photographed the artwork for Zedd and Alessia Cara's double platinum single ""Stay"" and Zedd & Liam Payne's single ""Get Low"" in collaboration with Samuel Burgess-Johnson.
