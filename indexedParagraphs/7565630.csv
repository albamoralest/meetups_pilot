"He began on piano but was advised to switch to trombone due to his having a mild form of dyslexia. This condition did not hamper his music, and by fifteen he had turned professional. He played for Herb Pomeroy's band from 1955 to 1957 and then toured with the Dorsey Brothers. In 1960 he was drafted into the U.S. Army and served on NORAD Band.  Later, he worked with Woody Herman and in the 1960s wrote music for Buddy Rich. He formed an ensemble that became one of the most well-regarded college jazz bands. Wilson played with Louis Armstrong at the 1964 Grammy Awards. His arrangement of ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"" for Buddy Rich received a Grammy Award nomination. The City of Boston proclaimed December 9, 1995 Phil Wilson Day for his contributions to jazz education. In April 2004, Wilson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music during the 40th anniversary celebration of his Rainbow Band. In 2014, Wilson created an online video series with Paul The Trombonist that documented Wilson's pedagogy.
