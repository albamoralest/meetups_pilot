"Michel Charles Sardou, who is known by his credited stage name as Michel Sardou (French pronunciation: [miʃɛl ʃaʁl saʁdu] (listen); born 26 January 1947) is a French singer, songwriter and occasional actor.
",0,N/A
"He is known not only for his love songs (""La maladie d'amour"", ""Je vais t'aimer""), but also for songs dealing with various social and political issues, such as the rights of women in Islamic countries (""Musulmanes""), clerical celibacy (""Le curé""), colonialism (""Le temps des colonies"", ""Ils ont le pétrole mais c'est tout"") or the death penalty (""Je suis pour""). Another sometimes controversial theme found in some of his songs (""Les Ricains"" and ""Monsieur le Président de France"" for example) is his respect and support for the culture and foreign policies of the United States of America. He has been accused of being a racist due to his 1976 song ""Le temps des colonies"", in which a former colonial soldier proudly tells his memories of colonialism, but Sardou has always claimed the song was sarcastic. His 1981 single ""Les lacs du Connemara"" was an international hit (especially in the Netherlands). A number of his hit songs were written in collaboration with Jacques Revaux and Pierre Delanoë, a few others (most notably ""En chantant"") with Italian singer Toto Cutugno.

"Sardou sold out eighteen consecutive dates at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in 2001, while his 2004 album Du plaisir went straight to the number one spot on the French album charts. With a recording career of fifty years, Sardou has released 25 studio albums, 18 live albums and has recorded more than 350 songs (chiefly in French but also in Spanish, Italian and even English) and has sold more than 100 million records. Currently he is considered one of the most popular artists in the Francophone world and one of the most lucrative, both in sales and in his shows.

",8,== Biography == | ==== The early stages (1965–1970) ====
"Sardou began working as a waiter in his father's cabaret in Montmartre. He eventually met Michel Fugain and auditioned for Eddie Barclay. In 1965, Sardou began his recording career with ""Le madras"", co-written with Michel Fugain and Patrice Laffont. In 1967, his career really picked up, thanks to censorship: while France left NATO's integrated military command and the Vietnam War was causing anti-American sentiment in France, Sardou released ""Les Ricains"" (The Yanks), a song which stated the debt of gratitude towards the USA for the liberation of France. Charles de Gaulle did not like the song and he advised against its broadcast on state radio and television. This gave the singer a new notoriety, and the song let him lay the foundations for his future artistic style. However, from 1967 to 1970, he still found it difficult to have big hits.
",9,== Biography == | ==== The early stages (1965–1970) ====
"In view of the mitigated success of his singles, in 1969, Eddie Barclay decided to terminate his contract, estimating that Sardou was not cut out to be a singer. So, he founded the record label Tréma (which stands for Talar Revaux Éditions Musicales Associées), which would produce his records, with his friends Jacques Revaux (who will become his most loyal composer) and Régis Talar, a French record producer.

",11,== Biography == | ==== Success and controversies (1970–1980) ====
"He really met true success in 1970, when he released his first studio album, J'habite en France. Three songs extracted from this work became hits : ""J'habite en France"" (""I live in France""), ""Et mourir de plaisir"" (""To die of pleasure"") but mainly ""Les bals populaires"" (""Popular Dances""), which reached the top of the French chart.
",12,== Biography == | ==== Success and controversies (1970–1980) ====
"From this album, the hits would be uninterrupted throughout the 1970s. The songs ""Le rire du sergent"" (""The Sergeant's Laugh"") (1971), ""Le surveillant général"" (""The Superintendent"") (1972) found favour with the public. But his success was sealed in 1973 with the album La maladie d'amour. Its title track ""La maladie d'amour"" (""The Disease of Love""), ""Les vieux mariés"" (which translates as ""The old married couple"", but adapted in English under the title ""It's not too late to start again"") and ""Les villes de solitude"" (""The Cities of loneliness"") would eventually become great successes. However, this last song triggered a controversy as Sardou takes the role of a man who, tired of his monotonous daily routine, drunkenly expresses his brutal fantasies (of robbing a bank and raping women), but never acts on them. The feminist organisation MLF objected.
",13,== Biography == | ==== Success and controversies (1970–1980) ====
"The controversies reached their peak in 1976, with the album La vieille (The Old Woman). The first single from it, ""Le France"" (""SS France""), released on November 1975, was a message of indignation addressed to the President of France Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, who had just sold the ocean liner SS France. The controversial song was welcomed by the trade unions and the Communist Party even though Sardou was seen, because of several other songs, as an archetypal reactionary singer. Even after the album was a real triumph (more than a million copies sold), other extracts, like ""J'accuse"" (""I charge men of..."") or ""Le temps des colonies"" (""The Days of Empire"") are about a singer who defends old conservative values. He was even accused of being a racist and an apologist for colonialism, but he has always insisted that the song is written in character rather than being an expression of his own views. The song ""Je suis pour..."" (""I am in favour of ..."") puts Sardou in the role of a man in favour of the death penalty because his own son has been killed. In the wake of this, and other political positions expressed by him, Anti-Sardou campaigns were started; their demonstrations regularly disrupted the singer's tours, although other left-wingers felt that Sardou was entitled to his freedom of speech. The next year, in 1977, Sardou moved away from politics. His next album, La java de Broadway, contained famous songs, such as ""La java de Broadway"" (""The Java of Broadway""), ""Dix ans plus tôt"" (""Ten years earlier"") and a revival of the Claude François hit ""Comme d'habitude"" (the tune of which is best known to English-speaking audiences as ""My Way""). The album was a huge success, exactly like the next Je vole (1978), which gave him one of his biggest hits, ""En chantant"" (""Singing""), written together with the Italian singer Toto Cutugno.

"The 1980s began under good omens for the singer, with the album Les lacs du Connemara from which came two songs considered important to the entire canon of French popular music: ""Les lacs du Connemara"" (""The Lakes of Connemara"") and ""Être une femme"" (""Being a woman"").
",16,== Biography == | ==== A legend in motion (1981–2001) ====
"Throughout the decade, Sardou had a lot of success : ""Afrique adieu"" (""Farewell, Africa"") in 1982, ""Il était là"" (""He was here"") in 1982, ""Rouge"" (""Red"") in 1984, ""Chanteur de jazz"" (""Jazz Singer"") in 1985, ""La même eau qui coule"" (""The same water flowing"") in 1988... because his sales did not slow down, whereas a lot of his contemporaries had been forgotten during the disco boom.
",17,== Biography == | ==== A legend in motion (1981–2001) ====
"However he didn't shy away from controversial songs, and even had success with several of them : ""Vladimir Ilitch"", in 1983, which both pays tribute to the ideas of Lenin and denounces the drift of the Soviet Union away from them; ""Les deux écoles"" (""The Two Schools""), in 1984, which recalls the opposition between the free school and the private school with a defence of private schools; ""Musulmanes"" (""Muslim women""), in 1986, which casts a pessimistic and bitter look at the rights of women in Islamic countries but which also pays a tribute to Arabic culture.
",18,== Biography == | ==== A legend in motion (1981–2001) ====
"At the end of the 1980s, Sardou received the recognition of his peers by being awarded a Music Victory for ""Musulmanes"" as the best song of the year.
",19,== Biography == | ==== A legend in motion (1981–2001) ====
"In the 1990s, the run of hit singles dried up, even if his four albums had very good sales.

"""La maladie d'amour"" (""The Disease of Love""), released in 1973. It is certainly Michel Sardou's most famous song and stayed at the top of the charts for 11 weeks.

"""Le France"" (""SS France""), released in 1975. Sardou resents the selling of the liner SS France by the President of France Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.

"""Être une femme"" (""Being a woman""), released in 1981. A satirical view on the evolution of women's social status.

"""Les lacs du Connemara"" (""The Lakes of Connemara""), released in 1981.  A lyrical evocation of Ireland and another one of his most popular songs, it is very often sung at the end of French student parties and at weddings in France or in Belgium. The song also has a tourism impact, with an estimated 350,000 additional visits to Connemara. Kylemore Abbey, the first tourist attraction in the region, has 20% French visitors, and guided tours are offered in this language. Of the 350,000 French who visit Ireland annually, more than half go to Connemara.
