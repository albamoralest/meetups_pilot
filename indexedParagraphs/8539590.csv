"In 1960, Welch signed with Cadence Records. His biggest hit, a cover version of the big band standard ""Since I Fell for You,"" reached number 4 on U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1963, selling a million copies. His other hits included ""Ebb Tide"" in 1964, which was featured in the film Sweet Bird of Youth; and ""You Don't Know Me."" He also recorded the first vocal version of ""A Taste of Honey"" in 1962 and performed the theme to the 1967 CBS TV series Coronet Blue. Welch reimagined Neil Sedaka's ""Breaking Up is Hard to Do"" as a torch song, which became a minor Top 40 hit in 1970; a few years later, Sedaka himself would re-record the song in Welch's style to make it a top-10 hit of his own.

"After Welch's recording career ended, he resumed his education, attending night school after driving a taxicab during the day. He first achieved a high school equivalency degree, then graduated from the College of New Rochelle with a bachelor's degree. He also began singing for commercials, first for Subaru and later for products that included Coca-Cola, M&M's, and Mini-Oreos. From 1990-1991, Welch joined The Royal All Stars (The Doo Wop All Stars), first of the ""supergroups"" to be formed bringing together singers from different groups to perform. This group consisted of Welch, Vito Balsamo from Vito & the Salutations, Artie Loria from The Earls, Randy Silverman from The Impalas and Eugene Pitt from The Jive Five. They became a mainstay in the ""doo wop"" circuit and toured relentlessly in the following years.
