"Mark August Stoermer was born in Houston, Texas, to a German Australian father who was a physician and a big-band-style musician and an American mother who was a nurse. They moved to Las Vegas when Stoermer was three years old. Stoermer graduated in 1995 from Chaparral High School, where he played trumpet in the jazz ensemble. His early musical influences included hip hop bands such as Public Enemy and N.W. A and later rock bands such as Nirvana, the Beatles, the Who and Pink Floyd. Stoermer played lead guitar for a number of local bands including Habit Rouge and the Negative Ponies.  Before the Killers got signed, Stoermer worked as a medical courier. Stoermer also studied philosophy and music at UNLV.

"Stoermer has been dubbed 'The Gentle Giant' by bandmates and fans due to his quiet but kind nature, and because he is 6 feet 5 inches.

"It was while playing guitar with the Negative Ponies that Stoermer met Brandon Flowers and Dave Keuning, who were performing as an early incarnation of the Killers. He was a fan of the band's unique sound and was often present at the band's gigs. ""They even asked me to join the band as a guitar player, because originally – at least according to Dave – they wanted to build a five-piece, possibly more like the Strokes with a keyboard,"" said Stoermer in 2016. ""I was first asked to be a second guitar player and I casually mentioned I also play bass. And then one day I got the call from Dave."" In September 2002 he was offered the opportunity to become the band's permanent bass player, he accepted and completed the band's lineup along with Ronnie Vannucci Jr. The band's six albums each reached No. 1 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart and garnered the band seven GRAMMY Award nominations and seven BRIT Award nominations.

"In 2010, Stoermer produced rock band Howling Bells' third studio album, The Loudest Engine. The album was recorded at Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas, Nevada, and was released in September 2011. On September 24, 2014, Stoermer performed ""Let It Down"" and ""Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)"" with Dhani Harrison on Conan during George Harrison week. In late 2014 and early 2015, Stoermer played bass guitar on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins along with Billy Corgan, Jeff Schroeder and Brad Wilk. A Smashing Pumpkins fan since his teen years, Stoermer received a call from Corgan – who had become a casual acquaintance after their respective bands played a few shows together in recent years – to join the touring line-up in support of the Smashing Pumpkins' then-new album Monuments to an Elegy. The strength of the new material convinced Stoermer to accept the offer. ""In addition to the nostalgia aspect, I also had to hear the new music, which I think is great. If the new music wasn't up to par, I wouldn't be doing it. I felt like, yeah, it was one of those things I had to do"", he said. On December 1, 2014, Stoermer performed ""Maida Vale"" with Smashing Pumpkins on BBC Radio 6. On December 11, 2014, he performed ""Being Beige"" with Smashing Pumpkins on Jimmy Kimmel Live. On April 3, 2015, he performed ""Drum + Fife"" with the Smashing Pumpkins on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

"On May 24, 2016, the Killers announced that Stoermer was taking a break from touring ""to pursue other educational goals and releasing a solo album."" The statement emphasized that Stoermer was still involved in working on the band's fifth album, and that he may still occasionally perform live with them in the future. Stoermer elaborated further in an interview: ""I'm taking a class online right now. The reason why I'm doing that is to take a break, but not exclusively. It's a combination of a lot of things. I've been doing the Killers since 2003 and I think about a thousand shows. I just needed to step away a while from that."" Stoermer performed with the band at their 2017 Glastonbury Festival appearance, as well as at the Vegas Strong benefit show that December. Stoermer also appeared with the band as a part of their appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live in April 2019.

"Stoermer talked about his idea for writing ""Dark Arts"" with Interview Magazine: ""I wanted to do at least one [record] that was an album experience, even though the days of the album experience may be over. If anything, it may be a tribute to those times... Maybe someone out there will have that experience with this album.""Soaked in sixties psychedelic foundations, the album is noticeably different from the work he is known for in the Killers.

",25,== Career == | ==== Filthy Apes and Lions (2017) ====
"Stoermer talked about the songwriting process behind the single ""Filthy Apes and Lions"": I was doing a stream-of-consciousness, surrealistic exercise where you just write out whatever's on the top of your head, and then I started creating rhymes, not really knowing where I was going, and then that's where I got the lyrics for the song [...] ""Filthy Apes and Lions.""

"Stoermer mainly plays with a pick.  He says ""I love the punch and grit of a pick. . . I do a lot of unconscious palm muting.  I love how you can instantly get that clunky tone with shorter notes.  It's a great sound."" He tries to play the bass as a ""half percussive. . . half melodic instrument"".  Stoermer feels that ""You can add to a song's melodic side without taking away from the vocals.  That's my favorite kind of bass playing.""  His signature bass playing is featured prominently in the Killers' debut and sophomore albums.
",29,== Artistry == | === Playing style ===
"While his aggressive playing was a focal point in the Killers' first two albums, Stoermer's playing became more funk-driven in Day & Age, and much more reserved and subtle in Battle Born. His style of playing has influenced many other bands and even a genre of music in bass-driven New Wave-synth rock.
",30,== Artistry == | === Playing style ===
"Stoermer was featured on the cover of Bass Guitar Magazine in June 2009 and has been interviewed by other major bass guitar publications including Bass Player Magazine. Stoermer is widely recognized for his signature tone: an overdriven signal using two modified BOSS Blues Driver pedals fed into separate amplifiers using high top-end frequencies to produce a trebly but thick, cutting sound while retaining excellent bass response, similar to that of Chris Squire (bassist of the band Yes).
",31,== Artistry == | === Playing style ===
"Stoermer is also noted for heavily accenting his notes to produce string popping, as well as his use of jumping between octaves.

"Stoermer cites influences such as Noel Redding of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, John Entwistle of the Who, and Paul McCartney of the Beatles and solo. He also lists the Cure, U2, and New Order as influences.
