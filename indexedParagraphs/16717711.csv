"Palmer joined the band in 1977 and plays on all their albums and singles. He played his guitar in an unusual way: his left hand would be sliding over the fretboard while he strummed the strings with his right thumb, using the instrument to produce 'drone' or percussive sounds. He hardly ever played conventional chords and never a solo.

"Palmer was also responsible for the artwork for some of the albums released by Crass Records, such as The Eye by Kukl and The Fucking Cunts Treat Us Like Pricks by Flux Of Pink Indians. He left Crass in July 1984, after a concert in Aberdare, Wales. This catalysed the affirmation of Crass' consistently stated intention to split up in 1984, and the band stopped performing and recording.

"Palmer returned to his art college studies. Between 1985 and 1990, he studied at St. Martins School of Art and the Royal College of Art. His paintings are regularly exhibited. He collaborated with former Crass members as part of the 2002 'Voices In Opposition To War' event at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's South Bank, performing three songs with Eve Libertine and jazz guitarist Phil Robson. Apart from this he has chosen not to participate in, nor contribute to, any further Crass related activities or projects, including books and documentaries about the band.
