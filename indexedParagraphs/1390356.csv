"Rapp's musical career began in 1955 with the formation of his group The Juvenairs, which later became known as Danny and the Juniors. Their 1957 song ""Do the Bop"" came to the attention of Dick Clark, who suggested they rename it to ""At the Hop.""  After limited initial success with the song, it became a worldwide hit when it was played on American Bandstand. The Juniors went on to have two more hits ""Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay"" and ""Twistin' USA"". The Juniors released several more records in the 1960s but were not able to produce any more hits. In the 1970s, they capitalized on a strong 1950s nostalgia movement by touring and rerecording ""At The Hop"" in 1976.

"Danny and the Juniors broke up and regrouped over the years, and split into 2 groups in 1978. One featured Joe Terranova and Frank Maffei, while the other featured Rapp with various backing singers. Both groups performed under the ""Danny and the Juniors"" name. Rapp's last performance was in Phoenix, Arizona at the Silver Lining Lounge of The Different Pointe restaurant in the Pointe Tapatio Resort in a month-long engagement which was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 2, 1983.
