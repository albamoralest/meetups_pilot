"Labadie grew up in the Basque Country, and played bass in regional underground bands. Since 1998, Labadie has been the bassist of the metal band Gojira, which was formed in Ondres (Landes), near Bayonne (Basque Country). The whole band grew up in the south-west of France. Labadie is known for his energetic live presence during shows, with much jumping around the stage and heavy headbanging. Of the concerts made with Gojira, Labadie said, ""I don't feel like a rock star but just human. I'm looking for my place and I want to give the best of myself, and while I can be useful, I just try to do good to people"".

"Labadie likes landscapes, solitude, nature and adrenaline. He started practicing boardsports such as skateboarding, surfing and snowboarding. In 1996, he became passionate about mountain biking, and found these sensations again, ""but more brutal"". When he's not touring across the world with Gojira, he practices mountain biking at a high level in his Savoyard mountains, the place where he resides.  Labadie said, ""Playing sports helps keep up the pace. For the drummer, too, you have to train. I like to push my body and the adrenaline it gives me"".
