"Tomasa was born in Iquique, Chile on December 1, 1986, to an upper-class family. She studied design in Santiago, Chile. Kids at school used to tease her by calling her Tomasa, but she eventually took to the name because it sounded both masculine and feminine. She said that she feels like ""a man but very much a woman"".

"During her time working in Iquique as a tattoo artist, Tomasa's mother bought her a laptop. She would record herself singing and rapping with the Photo Booth application, and began uploading these videos to Facebook and YouTube. At this time, she would tour the continent giving tattoos to people. It was on these tours where she began performing regggaetón at DIY parties. Her reputation as a tattoo artist began growing to the point where customers all over the world knew about her love for reggaetón. Tattoo customers would invite her to record in their home studios. In 2015, due to growing success and demand as a performer, Del Real closed her tattoo shop, as she no longer had the time to attend to it. Del Real released her first album Bien y Mal in March 2016. Many of her earliest songs were included on the album, leading critics to note that despite its DIY spirit, many songs have become some of the best examples for the genre. Tomasa is a self described ""reggeatón nerd"", and researches the genre daily. Her album Bellaca del Año was released on May 18, 2018, via Nacional Records.
