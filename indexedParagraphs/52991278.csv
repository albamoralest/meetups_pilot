"Truls Dyrstad showed an early interest in music, and started playing the guitar at a young age before he started to produce music later on. David Atarodiyan didn't start playing or making music until his teens, but quit his job and went on a hiatus abroad to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. Although they both studied at the University of Agder in Norway, it was a series of coincidences and mutual friends that brought them together.
