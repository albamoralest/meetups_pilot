"At 13 years of age de la Rocha travelled to the capital Managua in search of a radio station where he would be able to perform- even though at the time it was extremely difficult to break into the then newly available radio broadcasting.
",5,== Early life ==
"According to de la Rocha in 1948 he began to find fame via the broadcast of ""Voz de la Victoria"" (The Voice of Victory) on an amateur talent program hosted by the well known baccalaureate Oscar Pérez Valdivia, after he began to listen to the music of Nicaraguan greats such as Camilo Zapata.

"It was thanks to this trio that de la Rocha was able to create one of the characters that would bring him nationwide fame. After the three performed on a live radio program hosted by radio entrepreneur Fabio Gadea Mantilla, he was asked to read a script in the style of a peasant farmer- thus ""Pancho Madrigal"" was born. The program, also called Pancho Madrigal, was broadcast on Radio Mundial (Worldwide Radio), replacing the character Tío Popo  played by Rodolfo Arana Sándigo who, due to health issues, was unable to continue performing.
",8,== Pancho Madrigal ==
"The program was subsequently transferred to Radio Corporación where de la Rocha continued to work for 20 years. De la Rocha continued creating much loved characters, the most well known of which include Aniceto Prieto  (an annoying native, according to de la Rocha), Indio Filomeno  (the protagonist of another radio program which is also broadcast on television), Filito, as well as La Chepona, Mustafá the Turk and Policarpio Matute among others.

"The character of Aniceto Prieto is much loved in Nicaragua, according to de la Rocha.
",10,== Pancho Madrigal ==
"""the name can be translated into many languages: 'Anice Price' in English, 'Anicetof Pietrovich' in Parluski, 'Aniceté Petrua' in Fransua, 'Anicetini Pietronini' in Italianini and Aniceto Prieto in Chapiollo.""Due to his work on the program ""El Indio Filomeno"" de la Rocha was sued on three occasions by the then head of National Guard radio and television Colonel Alberto Luna Solórzano.
",11,== Pancho Madrigal ==
"De la Rocha maintained that the program did not express the names of figures from the then present era of repressive politics in Nicaragua.
",12,== Pancho Madrigal ==
"""...but I would say 'Sodom and Gomorra, get the point Somoza', so colonel Luna Solórzano would call me before he would sue me to say 'Don't think that we're stupid, because we know perfectly well who you're talking about and we know you're badmouthing the Guard.""He recalls that at Radio Corporación he, along with Carlos Mejía Godoy, ran a program called ""Corporito"" and

"""...it was there he (Luna Solórzano) finally got me, but since Carlos owned the program he got stuck with the first fine in 1965.""The fine was for 10,000 córdobas ($1,428 USD at the time), which the populace helped to fund out of affection for the characters and actors.

"After the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution in 1979, de la Rocha created a program called ""El tronco de los mensajeros "" (The Messenger's Trunk) at the recently opened ""Radio Sandino"", as well as an agricultural program for farmers.
",16,== Radio production ==
"In 1982 he transferred to radio broadcasting station ""Voz de Nicaragua"" (Voice of Nicaragua) with the programs ""La Palomita Mensajera "" (The Messenger Bird) and ""Lencho Catarrán "". In 1990 he and his programs moved to Radio Ya.
",17,== Radio production ==
"In ""Lencho Catarrán"", his current wife plays the role of ""Lupita"", whom his character Aniceto Prieto is constantly trying to seduce. He and Lupita together appear in various television commercials.
",18,== Radio production ==
