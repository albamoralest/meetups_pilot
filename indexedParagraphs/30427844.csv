"In the early 1990s, Regan was a Parks Commissioner for the Village of Wappingers Falls, New York. In 2006, Peter Frampton played outdoors in Wappingers Falls, New York with Regan for local residents. As of 2014, he co-hosts a Sunday morning radio show called Cafe Italia on 1450AM WKIP out of Poughkeepsie, NY. ""We kicked around the possibility of a weekly radio program that focused on these timeless artists, their connection to Italian music and culture, and generally a show that would pay homage to the songs that are the ""soundtrack"" to many of our lives.""Regan is part of the band Four By Fate, which saw him reunite with former Frehley's Comet co-frontman Tod Howarth.
