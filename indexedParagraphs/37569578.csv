"I Self Devine was born in Los Angeles, California and moved to Minnesota with his mom when she got accepted to the University of Minnesota's social work master's program. He says, ""The first time that I became aware of hip-hop was in 1979, when my mom gave me ""Rapper's Delight,"" the 12-inch."" He experimented with graffiti writing, freestyling, DJing, and breakdancing before starting to invest lots of time into rapping and graffiti.
