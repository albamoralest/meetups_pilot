"Master Madan (Gurmukhi: ਮਾਸਟਰ ਮਦਨ; 28 December 1927 – 5 June 1942) was a talented Ghazal and geet singer of India of pre-independence era.  During his life, he only recorded eight songs, and these are now commonly available.  He was born 28 December 1927, in Khan Khana, a village in District Jalandhar District (now Nawanshahar) of the Punjab. This village was found by reputed courtier of Akbar, Abdul Rahim Khan-i-khana, who was a prolific writer. He died on 5 June 1942, reportedly due to mercury poisoning of his milk while at Shimla.
