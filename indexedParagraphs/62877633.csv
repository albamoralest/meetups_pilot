"In January 2020, it was announced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) that Österdahl would replace Jon Ola Sand as the Executive Supervisor of the Eurovision Song Contest after the final of the 2020 contest, which would have taken place in Rotterdam in May 2020. However, the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic; Österdahl would succeed Sand as the new Executive Supervisor of the Contest after the one-off replacement show, Eurovision: Europe Shine A Light was aired. As Executive Supervisor, Österdahl has the last call with regards to the production of the Eurovision Song Contest, with the ability to overrule the producers, and instruct. He is also responsible for the organization of the voting system of the contest. He first made his debut as Executive Supervisor at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2020 in Warsaw, and later at the Eurovision Song Contest 2021 in Rotterdam.
