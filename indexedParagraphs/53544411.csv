"The son of Mark Crabtree of Burnley-based professional audio equipment manufacturer AMS Neve, Joe lived in nearby Read and was educated at Clitheroe Royal Grammar School. Crabtree began his drumming career at age 11 studying with a local self-taught drummer, Harry Hindle. It was while studying with Hindle that Crabtree was first introduced to the drumming of Dave Weckl via his instructional video The Next Step. Crabtree cites this as a defining moment in his understanding of what was possible on the drums. He started playing live shows at age 14, and began teaching drums to local drummers at age 15. Having taken up guitar at age 12, he also taught guitar to beginner students for a number of years. While studying physics at Durham University between 1998 and 2000, Crabtree wrote and recorded with original band Breakmaus. Breakmaus recorded two self-released albums, That White Door and Arrested, and made an appearance on Sky TV on the show Where It's At. Crabtree also played with many cover bands, small jazz bands, and the university big band while studying at Durham. Moving to London in 2004, Crabtree continued his drum studies with London musician Bob Armstrong, whose former students include Oasis's Alan White, and The Who's Zak Starkey.
