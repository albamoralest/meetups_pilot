"Graves was recording a demo with his band the Mopes in Lodi, New Jersey, when their engineer, Bob Alecca, mentioned that the Misfits were reforming and holding auditions for a new singer. Graves bought the Collection I and Walk Among Us albums to familiarize himself with the band and became an official member about a year after trying out.

"In September 2008, Graves confirmed that he would return to the Misfits if asked: ""Jerry and I do not have a dysfunctional working relationship. Him and I both know and I know he knows that I am on board. It is a phone call away. I won't step back into what I walked away from, but the problem isn't with Jerry and I. The problem is with Doyle and with Chud.""On December 26, 2009, Graves appeared on stage with Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein and Dr. Chud's band Gorgeous Frankenstein at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey, who was opening for Danzig. While on stage, the band (along with Graves on vocals) played four late-1990s-era Misfits songs (""Helena"", ""Lost in Space"", ""Scarecrow Man"" and ""Shining""), but they were cut short from playing ""Dig Up Her Bones"" due to time. Graves' singing can be found on American Psycho, Famous Monsters, backup vocals on the 1999 single ""Monster Mash"", and ""Cuts from the Crypt"". He also wrote original songs for the band such as ""Dig Up Her Bones"", ""American Psycho"", ""Scream!"", ""Saturday Night"", ""This Island Earth"", ""Fiend without a Face"", ""Shining"", ""The Haunting"",""Devil Doll"", ""Witch Hunt"", and ""Fiend Club"".

"During a break in touring in 2000, Graves and Dr. Chud formed a band called The Lost Boys. They played two shows before the Misfits regrouped to embark on another tour, which was their last tour with this lineup. The first Lost Boys show consisted of Graves on an acoustic guitar and vocals while Dr. Chud played drums. They played Misfits songs they had written as well as songs later used for the band Graves which Graves wrote. The second show was the same music played as the first show, only this time the lineup consisted of Graves on vocals and electric guitar (he used Misfits guitarist Doyle's old Ibanez Iceman which was given to Graves as a gift upon joining the Misfits back in 1995), Dr. Chud on drums, and ""J-Sin Trioxin"" (Mister Monster) on bass. Later on as an encore set, J.V. Bastard (of Mister Monster, Gotham Road, Darrow Chemical Company, and Blitzkid) took the stage joining the band to play guitar as Graves sang. The four played a set of ""classic"" Misfits songs from the 1977–1983 era of the band.

"After Graves and Dr. Chud's split with the Misfits on October 25, 2000, they formed the band Graves which made one album called Web of Dharma. Before the band finished writing songs, recording, touring and even solidifying a lineup, Graves rejoined the Misfits, but only as a guest vocalist for a month during the M25 kickoff tour. He would perform Misfits songs written during the time of his tenure with the band to raise money for his new project, Graves. During a two-day break on their Web of Dharma 2 tour, the band recorded what was to be new material for a second album in Ripsnorter Studios, located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The studio is owned by members of the Minneapolis horror rock band Ripsnorter, who offered the band free studio time. The recordings were never finished due to disagreements between the mixing of the songs and have never officially been released. After two successful US tours and the verge of a breakout record contract, Graves dissolved due to differences between Graves and Dr. Chud, after only releasing one album.

"Graves formed Gotham Rd shortly after with Loki, JV Bastard and Paul Lifeless. Under the assumed name of Graves they recorded a five-song demo of redone Graves songs, three which were released on Web of Dharma and two other songs which had been written and demoed with the original Graves lineup but not officially released. Around this time is also when Graves announced via his website that he would begin producing other bands albums on his off time. One such band is Stressbomb from Connecticut who recorded their first album, Self Medicate, with Graves as producer and his drummer Quincy as engineer during January 2006. After a few months of the band practicing, they decided to change the band's name to Gotham Rd. They released one album before going on hiatus so Graves could join the U.S. marines. His last show ever was to be on December 31, 2004. They went on two successful tours: 2003's Seasons of the Witch tour and 2004's Mourning Lights tour. Before their Mourning Lights tour, the band entered a studio to record three new songs they had written after their first tour. Out of the three songs, only one (""My Way"") had been mixed. The only way it was available for listening was by requesting it on Seton Hall University's WSOU, Pirate Radio. Before going on indefinite hiatus they would play one-off shows in New Jersey when home from the Punk Rock Is Dead, Graves solo tour. Their second-to-last show to date was held at the now defunct Connections in Clifton, New Jersey in March 2005. The band announced The Nightmare Rides Are Back all over the net and played a one-time-only reunion show in Belmar, New Jersey at the Goodwill Fire Hall with Cryptovyrus, The Zombie Mafia, Morbid Visions, and Johnny B. Morbid. They played a mix of material from Graves' solo works, Graves re-records, and Gotham Road, as well as some Misfits songs written by Graves. In 2008 and 2009, the band contributed some songs to the German compilation CDs Get Acquainted Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.

"Right before his leave for the marines, Graves was approached by Horror High Records to do a solo album. He eventually recorded his debut solo record Punk Rock Is Dead in 2005. The entire album was written and recorded with friend and bandmate in Gotham Road, Paul Lifeless, on drums in only one month. After being honorably discharged due to a back injury, Graves went to embark on a tour in support of the album with Loki, JV Bastard and Matt Johnson.
",13,== Life and career == | ==== 2005–2008 ====
"In March 2006, Graves began a tour in support of Damien Echols and the West Memphis Three. Matt Johnson was replaced with Quincy Smash, who had played bass guitar for one of Graves' bands, The Mopes, before the Misfits. To coincide with the 2006 Halloween/Almost Home 2 tour, Graves' second solo effort titled Return to Earth was released on Halloween day of 2006.

"Graves has written an album entitled Illusions with Echols. It consists of 15 songs and was released October 31, 2007. The lyrics are written by Echols and Graves, and feature J~Sin Trioxin and Quincy Smash. A year later, in October 2008, Graves released Illusions Live/Viretta Park, a combination live album and demo EP. It was recorded on April 24, 2008, at Club Bourbon in New Port Richey, Florida, and July 8 and 9, 2008 at Bucharest, Romania.

"In March 2012, Graves met Mark Allen Stuart, CEO of Hydraulic Entertainment. After several meetings discussing potential projects, Stuart and Graves decided to create their first album Vagabond. On September 28, 2012, Graves began a pledge through Kickstarter to release the album, which eventually was released on February 6, 2013. With Vagabond, Graves showed a completely different side of his songwriting, as the album genre ranges between folk, rock and country. The release marked the beginning of the highly productive and successful partnership between Graves and Hydraulic Entertainment. On August 27, 2013, the album Vagabond Acoustic was released, containing eight acoustic songs from Vagabond with a short description of each song.

"Later in 2012, a second Kickstarter release was announced, Lost Skeleton Returns, which Graves referred to as a return to horror punk, and stated would feature ten re-recorded classics as well as four new songs. Lost Skeleton Returns was released on June 20, 2013. Motionless in White vocalist Chris Motionless provided guest vocals on the track ""Forbidden Planet"". The album was supported by nationwide touring with Graves performing as his infamous ""Skele-Crow"" character for the first time in nearly a decade. Following the release of Lost Skeleton Returns, an instrumental version of the album was issued and made available to fans online. An extremely limited number of copies of this edition were made. An acoustic album called Supernatural was released on February 7, 2014, and features acoustically performed songs of Lost Skeleton Returns.

"He became a contributor to the Conservative Punk website in the early 2000s. In 2004, he was interviewed on his conservative positions on a piece for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. He became a libertarian in 2013. In 2020, Graves endorsed the Proud Boys in an Instagram post. The post was later deleted. In 2021, Graves posted on his website a page titled ""See You In Washington DC on January 5th and 6th"" and an image of a poster advertising ""InfoWars Alex Jones Rally to Save America"" (Jan. 5), with the statement ""I will be in Washington DC on January 5th and 6th taking part in several different missions alongside hundreds of thousands of fellow American patriots rally in the capital."" Similar poster art was posted on his Instagram page, including one apparently by ""Latinos for Trump"" with a photo of Graves and the words ""FREEDOM RALLY SPECIAL APPEARANCE"" with the date January 6. In mid-December 2020, Graves posted on his Parler account ""Seems like the choice is war"" - no context was given. On January 5, 2021, he posted ""The next two days changes everything. We are ready. We are awake. We are fuckin' pissed!"" On January 6, he posted a picture apparently of members of Congress lying on the floor between rows of seats, apparently taken that day, along with these words: ""When the people fear the government, there is tyranny... When the government fears the people... There is liberty."" He later posted ""R. I. P. America 1776-2021.""Graves was scheduled to play a private show for the Proud Boys in Washington DC on the afternoon of January 6, 2021. In March, he was listed as a possible witness for the defense by lawyers representing Ethan ""Rufio"" Nordean who was charged with conspiracy in connection with the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Reuters confirmed Graves to be a member of the Proud Boys after their interview with him.
