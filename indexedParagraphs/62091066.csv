"Brock was born and reared in Lexington, Kentucky. His parents, Dan and Jenny Brock, were active in the local music scene and met as members of the Lexington Singers. His education began early with Montessori School, and he started learning violin with the Suzuki method. He graduated from Bryan Station High School in 1992, before attending Northwestern Universityâ€™s Bienen School of Music, majoring in performance violin. At Northwestern, he met Erin Harper, who later became his wife and the mother of their twin daughters. As stated in the title of one of his albums, Brock's musical career, ""Almost Never Was."" During his sophomore year at Northwestern, while bicycling through a busy intersection, he was struck by a hit-and-run driver. Bystanders rushed to prevent him being hit again, since he was unable to stand or walk. He suffered compound-complex fractures of the femur, fibula, and tibia of his left leg, with the patella shattered into eight pieces. More than three years of surgeries and rehabilitation from the accident set back his formal studies. However, although Northwestern did not then offer a course of study for jazz violin, Brock was allowed to audit jazz classes while recovering. Despite the delay, he graduated in 1999.
