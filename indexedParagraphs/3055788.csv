"Rogers grew up playing guitar but he sang for a hardcore punk band named Soul Integrity in high school. In 1999, he became the guitarist for the metalcore band, Prayer for Cleansing; when they disbanded, Rogers co-founded the progressive metal band Between the Buried and Me in 2000. Although he intended to be their guitar player at first, the band could not find a vocalist which prompted him to take that role. After acquiring a full lineup, Between the Buried and Me released their three-song demo and then their self-titled debut album in 2002. In 2004, Rogers released a self-titled debut album for his electronica side project, named Giles. Rogers was one of the vocalists for the metal band From Here On and has appeared in numerous other musical projects, including the metal band Undying. He was part of a clothing line and a small musical duo project with Jacob Troth that is known as Jacob Rogers.

"Rogers' biggest influence is experimental singer Mike Patton, including his bands Mr. Bungle and Faith No More. Other artists that have greatly influenced him are Radiohead, Pink Floyd, The Mars Volta, Nine Inch Nails, and Muse. Since high school, one of his biggest inspirations has been electronic music; some of these artists include Adult, Funker Vogt, Air and Dieselboy. The singer has consistently names the Beatles among his favorite bands. Furthermore, Rogers draws techniques from directors and filmmakers of works like The Twilight Zone, The Hateful Eight and The Godfather series. Rogers grew up a big fan of extreme metal, but only once he discovered metallic hardcore bands such as Earth Crisis he began to write music devotedly. After being in hardcore bands until his early 20s, Rogers realized that his tastes were much wider and decided to explore many musical avenues. He has a long-standing fascination with the Scandinavian black metal scene, admiring its experimentation around the turn of the millennium and bands like Ulver and Leprous. In 2019, Rogers named Radiohead's OK Computer, any Beatles record and Mr. Bungle's California his three favorite albums.
