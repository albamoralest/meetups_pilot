"Scott John Hutchison (20 November 1981 – 9 May 2018) was a Scottish singer, songwriter, guitarist and artist. He was the founding member and primary songwriter of the indie rock band Frightened Rabbit, with whom he recorded five studio albums, and created the artwork for each release. Hutchison was also a member of the musical collective The Fruit Tree Foundation, and released one solo album under the moniker Owl John. His last musical project was the indie ""supergroup"" Mastersystem, featuring Frightened Rabbit bandmate and brother Grant alongside members of Editors and Minor Victories. Hutchison studied illustration at the Glasgow School of Art, before forming Frightened Rabbit in 2003. Initially a solo project, Hutchison collaborated with his brother Grant on the band's debut album, Sing the Greys (2006), and recorded the band's critical breakthrough, The Midnight Organ Fight (2008), as a three-piece, following the collapse of a romantic relationship. Following the album's release, the band's fanbase expanded significantly and a third studio album, The Winter of Mixed Drinks, was released in 2010. Signing to Atlantic Records, the band released their fourth studio album, Pedestrian Verse, in 2013. The following year, Hutchison recorded a solo album as Owl John. In 2016, the band released their fifth and final studio album, Painting of a Panic Attack. Hutchison disappeared on 9 May 2018, and his body was found the following day on the banks of the Firth of Forth.

"Hutchison was born on 20 November 1981 in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was raised in the Scottish Borders town of Selkirk. He was the second of three sons born to Marion and Ron Hutchison, grew up with a close relationship to his brothers Neil and Grant. Hutchison suffered from anxiety and night terrors throughout his childhood, and his mother would often refer to him as her ""little frightened rabbit"". In particular, Hutchison avoided socialization with other children of his age, and would play by himself in silence. Moving to the city of Glasgow, he studied illustration at the Glasgow School of Art: ""I was there for four years and I didn't particularly want to be an illustrator, so I wanted to apply the rules that I learnt to everything I do, in terms of working in a bank or writing music."" While living in Glasgow, he worked in a specialist whisky shop in the residential area of Hyndland, noting: ""I began to appreciate and admire the heritage of flavour in a dram of single malt.""Initially considering himself solely a guitarist, Hutchison began singing at the age of nineteen, stating: ""Up to that point I was just a guitar player. I didn't know I could sing, I had been told I couldn't."" His early songwriting influences included such American artists as Ryan Adams, Wilco and Laura Cantrell, with Hutchison noting, ""When I started writing songs, my references were [these] Americana acts. [...] I could associate with those stories. And you can see American folk's deep connections with Scottish folk.""

"In 2003, Hutchison began performing under the name Frightened Rabbit, a name given to him by his mother to describe his once shy nature, and began recording and performing with his brother the following year. The duo recorded the band's debut album, Sing the Greys, at The Diving Bell Lounge, with producer Marcus MacKay, and released it independently on local label, Hits the Fan, in 2006; the band signed soon after to Fat Cat Records. Joined by guitarist Billy Kennedy, the band reissued the album on their new label and began work on its follow-up, The Midnight Organ Fight (2008), with producer Peter Katis, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Influenced by the collapse of his relationship with his high school and college girlfriend Shell Jubin, the deeply personal album was released to widespread critical acclaim and increased the band's exposure significantly.

"Owl John was a solo musical project by Hutchison, formed in 2014. Regarding Owl John and his decision to release a solo record, Hutchison noted, ""It was approximately 10 years ago that I started a band called Frightened Rabbit. In that time I've dedicated so much of my life to that good wee band with a stupid name, I felt it was time to indulge Owl John.""Hutchison recorded the project's sole album, Owl John (2014), alongside his Frightened Rabbit bandmate Andy Monaghan and the band's touring guitarist Simon Liddell. In January 2014, after a long tour in support of Frightened Rabbit's fourth studio album Pedestrian Verse (2013), Hutchison expressed his desire to record solo material without the band, stating: ""The process has to be different, otherwise I'm just going to make a Frightened Rabbit-sounding record, which I really don't want to do.""The idea for a solo album stemmed from Frightened Rabbit's label, Atlantic Records: ""It was actually the idea of the label to make it rather than me. I thought we were going to get off tour and go straight back into writing another album, and the guy at the label knew things weren't really quite right. He basically was like, 'We'll pay for this record. Go away, make a record and indulge yourself.'"" The following month, work began on the album, on the Isle of Mull, with bandmate Andy Monaghan producing, alongside Simon Liddell. Released on 4 August 2014, the self-titled album debuted at number ninety-nine on the UK Albums Chart.

"Hutchison wrote and recorded with The Fruit Tree Foundation, a collaborative charity project featuring Scottish indie rock and folk musicians. The resulting album, First Edition, was released in 2011. Regarding the experience, Hutchison stated: ""It was really beautifully done. I thought it was such a great thing, and also personally, for me, that was my first taste of proper collaboration and it really changed my outlook on songwriting. Before, I was kind of like, 'Yeah, I know how to write songs. I don't need anyone's help', and then, of course, you learn so much. So it changed my whole outlook, and I would love to get involved in that kind of thing again.""Hutchison performed a guitar solo on the track ""A Bigger World"" by indie rock band The Birthday Suit, and is featured in its accompanying music video. The song was the first single released from the band's third studio album, A Hollow Hole of Riches (2014). Hutchison also played guitar and sang backing vocals on the Withered Hand track ""Fall Apart"" from the 2014 album New Gods. He previously appeared in the video for Withered Hand's 2012 song ""Inbetweens"".

"Hutchison was reported missing by Scottish police and the members of Frightened Rabbit on 9 May 2018. Hutchison was last seen at 1 a.m. 9 May leaving a hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had tweeted ""Be so good to everyone you love. It's not a given. I'm so annoyed that it’s not. I didn't live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones"", followed by ""I'm away now. Thanks."" prior to his disappearance. His brother and bandmate Grant, on the band's official Twitter account, urged anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact Police Scotland given his fragile state. On 10 May, the Chief Inspector of Police Scotland reported that they were searching the area around the Forth Road Bridge for Hutchison, and were looking to contact two individuals who were spotted walking along the bridge the night he disappeared.

Reading messages of support and hope from those he has helped through his art has helped immensely and we encourage you all to continue doing this. He will be missed by all of us and his absence will always be felt but he leaves a legacy of hope, kindness and colour that will forever be remembered and shared.
