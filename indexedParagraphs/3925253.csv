"Crothers began studying classical piano at age 9 and went on to major in composition at the University of California, Berkeley. At Berkeley, her teachers emphasized ""procedure and structure"" and ""compositional rigor"" over emotional expression, which did not sit well with Crothers. Inspired by his recording of ""C Minor Complex,"" one of the first examples on record of free improvisation, she relocated to New York City to become a student of Lennie Tristano.
