"Peck released her fourth single in early 2007. Titled ""Bad For Me,"" the single (which was co-written by Australian country singer Sherri√© Austin) was intended to be the lead-off to an upcoming second album. ""Bad For Me"" failed to reach the Hot Country Songs Top 40 (number 46), however, and the second album's release date was delayed until late 2008. That album, titled Can't Behave, was released on December 23 of that year, though it was only available through digital retailers. The title track to Can't Behave was then released as a single in January 2009. The single, however, failed to chart altogether, and Peck parted ways with Big Machine shortly afterward.

"In 2006, Peck briefly dated Boston Red Sox pitcher Josh Beckett. On October 18, 2007, she was a last-minute choice to sing the national anthem before Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians. While the Indians organization stated that she was chosen because she was an Ohio native and Indians fan, it was believed that she was brought in to distract Beckett, who was starting the game for the Red Sox. Beckett went on to a decisive victory, and when asked about Peck's presence, he replied: ""I don't get paid to make those fucking decisions...she's a friend of mine. It doesn't bother me at all. Thanks for flying one of my friends to the game, so she could watch it for free."" Peck has never publicly commented on the incident.
