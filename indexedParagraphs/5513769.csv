In addition to revealing his interest in working with 50 Cent, Zane also taunted Buck's music.""Yo, he's garbage, he's garbage,"" Zane told radio host EI8HT referring to Young Buck. ""He's garbage though, I don't think he's a good rapper. He might be a good person but you know, he probably feels the same way about me. So the feeling's mutual, you know? But I don't think he's the best rapper. I think I would have made 50 Cent a little more money. I think 50 needs to sign me, man. I think it needs to be 50 & 60 Cent or something because I'm more like 60 Cent. You know what I'm saying?
