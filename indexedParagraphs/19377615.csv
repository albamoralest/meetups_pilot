"When asked to describe some of his influences, he noted, ""When I was younger, I really got into an Eric Clapton anthology that had a cross selection of songs he was well known for, and some spontaneous jams with Jimmy Page and Muddy Waters. There was so much emotion and a big slice of life in those songs performed by the old blues players...Billy Gibbons was also a very big influence...He had a great way of synthesizing a lot of great styles and making it his own.""
