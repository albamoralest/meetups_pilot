"A resident of Fredon Township, New Jersey, he graduated from Pope John XXIII Regional High School in 2005; Warner Brothers had signed his band to a recording deal while he was still in high school. After opening for Yeasayer at New York City's Governors Island in summer 2010 and a residency at Brooklyn club Union Pool, the band attracted media and record label attention. That year, Delicate Steve signed to Luaka Bop, who released the ""Butterfly"" 7"" single, backed with a cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Albatross"" on the B-side.

"On January 25, 2011, Delicate Steve's debut album, Wondervisions, was released on Luaka Bop. The entirety of the album was recorded by Marion in his bedroom and quickly gained the attention of critics, becoming a ""Critics' Choice"" selection of The New York Times as well as being included on NPR's ""Favorite Songs of 2011"". For the release of Wondervisions, author Chuck Klosterman wrote a fictional biography of Delicate Steve. The bio was originally published anonymously and was mostly taken as fact by fans and press, but was exposed in a feature news story on NPR's All Things Considered.

"In 2019, Delicate Steve released Till I Burn Up on Anti-. The album is marked by an exploration of experimental elements and guitar tones inspired in part by Kanye West’s vocals on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, particularly the use of distorted and Auto-Tuned room mics. Later in 2019, West would go on to sample Wally Wilder, a track from Delicate Steve’s 2012 release, Positive Force.
