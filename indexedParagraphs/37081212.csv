"Elisabeth (Lisy) Fischer (born 22 August 1900 in Zurich – died 6 June 1999 in Newcastle upon Tyne) was a Swiss pianist from a talented Jewish family. Born to parents Arthur Fischer (from Deutsch Eylau, Prussia - now Iława, Poland) and Bertha Hochstetter (from Liedolsheim, Germany), she was a child prodigy giving piano recitals from 11 years of age first in Geneva and afterwards in Paris under the tutelage of Lucien Grou de Flagny and later Charles Barbier.

"Later as a teenager she played both as a soloist as well as with other musicians, giving concerts in Germany, where she studied from 15 years of age, and in Switzerland. She studied at the Stern Conservatory of Music in Berlin under Professor Martin Krause, Rudolf Maria Breithaupt and Professor Wilhelm Klatte where she was awarded the Professor Gustav Hollaender Medal in 1920, a few years after her fellow student, Claudio Arrau.

"An extract of the citation signed by the Director Professor Alexander von Fielitz and her teachers reads ""Her predetermination, the clarity and purity of her comprehension, the simplicity and natural manner of her performance, give her rendition a rare objectivity, calmness and technical competence. Her sincerity and purpose combined with a rare clarity and technical precision, as well as a fine musical dexterity, a loving and subtle extraction of every small detail give this new and unusual recital technique a compelling charm. These abilities further enhance the continued development of Miss Fischer’s compulsive, energetic and well disciplined character and clever mind on its way to a great artistic talent”. On 14 March 1919 the Director of the Stern Conservatory, Professor Alexander von Fielitz, wrote a letter 'to whom it may concern' seeking sponsorship for her as a talented pianist. He says in this letter that because of the war, her family are unable to assist her financially and she is having to teach in order to fund her living which is hindering her development. Her teacher, Rudolf Breithaupt, had a special affinity towards her and wrote a personal note to her over his photograph on May 12, 1919 ""The unconscious produces the greatest and most profound effects. To my student, Lisy Fischer, who is very conscious of what she is doing.""
