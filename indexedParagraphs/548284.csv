",1,== Biography ==
"Dame Darcy acquired her initial skill set while still a child and teen working as an apprentice to her father in his sign-painting studio, Green Tree Graphics. She began her own career at age 17 when she won a scholarship to the San Francisco Art Institute. During this time, she acted in films by George Kuchar. She made her first publishing deal at the age of 21 when her comic book series Meat Cake was picked up by Fantagraphics Books. She originally considered using the pen name ""Richard Dirt"" but her father suggested adding a title to her own first name instead, so Darcy used the name Richard Dirt as a character in her comic book. She performed for a time with Lisa Crystal Carver and Jean-Louis Costes's underground cabaret Suckdog Circus. SUCKDOG Reunion Tour 2016, a documentary concert film starring Lisa Carver (Lisa Suckdog) as ""The Dish"" and Dame Darcy as ""Ghost Mother"" is currently available as a DVD. Her latest books as of 2016 are Lady Killers (Harper Collins), The Jaywalker, with Lisa Carver,  Lucky, and other compilations. Dame Darcy's autobiography, Hi Jax & Hi Jinx, was published by Feral House in 2019, and has a feature film screenplay attached.  Her self-published Mermaid Tarot and Queen Alice tarot card decks are independently distributed. She has illustrated for fashion designers Anna Sui and Gothic Lolita designers CWC, Baby Doll, Ku, Coi Girl Magic and Jared Gold while working as a runway model in NYC and LA.
",2,== Biography ==
"In the 1990s, Dame Darcy made a doll for Courtney Love which included hair from the late Kurt Cobain. The doll was a gift to Love's daughter Frances Bean Cobain. Dame Darcy planned to auction some of Kurt Cobain's leftover hair in 2015 but withdrew it following a complaint from Love. Her teaching experience varies among all ages and contexts. Dame Darcy taught an independent comics publishing course at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, as well as lecturing and workshops at Columbia University, and in Europe and Japan.
