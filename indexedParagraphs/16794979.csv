"Quilla Hugh ""Porky"" Freeman (June 29, 1916 in Vera Cruz, Missouri, United States â€“ July 8, 2001) was an American Western swing performer, bandleader, and songwriter. He was also an electric guitar pioneer and inventor. In the 1940s he led the Californian based band, the 'Porky Freeman Trio'. One of his early hits, ""Porky's Boogie Woogie on Strings"", began rock and roll's evolution out of Western swing. As a session musician he backed many of the popular musicians of the time.
