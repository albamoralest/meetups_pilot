"Jan Eggum (born 8 December 1951) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter. He has been characterized as a ""face for the melancholy"", and the themes in his songs are often broken hearts, loneliness, and sorrow. Sometimes his lyrics include social criticism, but he also shows trivial and funny sides of himself.

"Eggum was born in Bergen, but started as a pub singer in London, and made his living for two years writing songs in English. One of his most famous songs – ""En natt forbi"" (""A night is over"") – was originally written in English, with the title ""Alone, Awake"". He got a record contract in 1975 with the Norwegian record company CBS, and recorded his debut album ""Trubadur"" that autumn. His breakthrough came after his third release, the album ""Heksedans"" from 1977. This album gave him the Norwegian award Spellemannsprisen, and on this album has such classics as ""Mor, jeg vil tilbake"". Since this, Eggum has been one of Norway's most well known artists, both as a solo artist and with others. An example of the latter is his membership in Gitarkameratene with fellow guitarists Lillebjørn Nilsen, Øystein Sunde and Halvdan Sivertsen. Eggum has been a minor political candidate for the Norwegian Green Party. He has three children, Frida (born 1980), Bastian (born 2006) and Hennika (born 2009).
