"In 2013, McCorkle put on a big band gala in the ballroom of The Hallmark (Battery Park City's senior residence). The goal of the evening was to recreate the zeitgeist of the early 1930s big band era for the center's residents while raising money for Alzheimer's research. The night was recorded and released as a digital download on Bandcamp. All ticket and record sales were benefited the Alzheimer's Foundation of America.
