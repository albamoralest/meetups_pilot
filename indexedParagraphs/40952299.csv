"Cowherd was born and raised in Kentucky. Being a son of musicians (and music educators), Cowherd began music at an early age singing, playing the piano, French horn and violin. He moved to New Orleans to attend Loyola University, where he studied jazz piano and improvisation under Ellis Marsalis, John Mahoney, and Steve Masakowski. The Brian Blade Fellowship album Season of Changes was released around 2008. Cowherd also worked with Brian Blade in his debut singer-songwriter album Mama Rosa, which was released in 2009 on Verve Records. As a producer, Cowherd has overseen albums by Lizz Wright, Alyssa Graham and The Local NYC. Cowherd's debut album as a leader, Mercy,  was released in 2013 on ArtistShare. It features Brian Blade, John Patitucci, and Bill Frisell. Reviewing the album for allaboutjazz, John Kelman wrote: ""With music this well-conceived and a band so telepathically connected, it may have taken Cowherd a long time to release an album under his own name, but with Mercy as the result, it's been well worth the wait; hopefully there won't be such a long one for the follow-up.""
