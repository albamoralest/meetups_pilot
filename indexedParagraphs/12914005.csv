"Critchinson was born in London in 1934. He worked as a part-time musician with Ronnie Scott, Tubby Hayes, and Jimmy Deuchar, among others. In 1979, at the recommendation of his mentor, Bill Le Sage, he was a member of Ronnie Scott's Quartet until it folded in 1995. During that time, he worked with many visiting American artists, including Chet Baker, George Coleman, James Moody, Joe Henderson and Johnny Griffin. In the early 1980s, he was associated with the British jazz fusion duo Morrissey–Mullen, appearing on two of their albums. He recorded with Dick Morrissey and was a member of Martin Drew's Our Band, with Ron Mathewson, Jim Mullen, and Dick Morrissey. In 1995, Critchinson formed a quartet with Art Themen on saxophone, Dave Green on bass and Dave Barry on drums.
