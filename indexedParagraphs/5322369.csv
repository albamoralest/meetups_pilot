"From New York City, Perry began playing the piano at age seven and then took up drums at eleven. After hearing The Beatles, he decided to take up drums, because of what he describes as ""the possibility, however unlikely that might have been, of young girls chasing me down the street, if I took up the drums."" By the time he was 14, he was working with his own band on weekends, and continued to do so until he graduated high school at the age of 17.
