"RBX joined Death Row Records in 1992 with his cousins Snoop Dogg and Daz Dillinger. A former college student and retail manager, Collins declined to sign blank contracts like his Death Row brethren. His tenure on the label would be brief but memorable. Having made commanding cameos on The Chronic in 1992 and Doggystyle in 1993, RBX left the label in 1994 and signed with the lesser known Premeditated Records. He released The RBX Files in 1995, his debut solo album that was produced by former Chronic production team member Greg ""Gregski"" Royal.

"The album abandoned the popular West coast G-Funk style in favor of a ""gritty, dungeon-like"" sound more associated with New York. The single ""A.W.O.L."" was an attack on Death Row, Suge Knight, Dre, and others, with X comparing the dubious business practices there to the days of Ruthless Records, Jerry Heller, and Eazy-E. In a YouTube interview with VladTV he talked about an altercation over food between him and Suge Knight, in which Knight pulled out a gun.

"In 1996, RBX visited Dr. Dre at home and apologized for his harsh words on record and in magazines and immediately signed to Dre's new Aftermath label. He was featured on the 1996 compilation Dr. Dre Presents... The Aftermath on the solo song ""Blunt Time"" and the group track ""East Coast/West Coast Killaz"" with KRS-One and Nas, with both songs produced by Dre. Lost in the infamous reshuffling of Aftermath in 1998, RBX once again went solo and released his follow up album No Mercy, No Remorse on an independent label in 1999. He reappeared with Aftermath to cameo on Eminem's second album in 2000.
