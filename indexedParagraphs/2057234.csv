"Since 1979 White has played in the Young Tuxedo Brass Band, founded by clarinetist John Casimir sometime in the 1940s. During the 1980s he led a band called The New Orleans Hot Seven. Performing ""A Tribute to Jelly Roll Morton"" in concert with them at the Lincoln Center in New York City in 1989 led to a favorable review by Jon Pareles in the New York Times. On May 25, 2004, a selection from White's album Dancing in the Sky (""Algiers Hoodoo Woman"") was broadcast on NPR's All Songs Considered. The Dancing in the Sky album is mostly original compositions by White.

On May 13, 2006, White performed ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee"" at the Tulane University commencement ceremony. Former U.S. presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton were in attendance at the ceremony. Clinton said that the music ""was played the way Dixieland bands have always done it. At first low, weeping, sorrowful.""
