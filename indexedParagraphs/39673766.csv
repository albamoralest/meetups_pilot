"Christian Andreu's influences include bands such as Death, Metallica, Morbid Angel, Tool, Slayer, and classical music. His favorite non-metal musicians are Mozart, La Tordue, Têtes Raides, and Björk, as well as Bulgarian music and Indian music. He cites French singers such as Alain Bashung, Barbara, Jacques Brel, and Georges Brassens. In an interview for Lyon's ZYVA Magazine, Andreu explained that he does not listen to much metal music apart from Gojira, stating that he primarily listens to classical music. Andreu credited ""Symbolic"" from the band Death as the song that portrays him. In 2007, he was also a guitarist in an experimental ethno-tribal progressive rock band playing in a traditional style called Familha Artús. On May, 2019 towards the end of the song ""Stranded"" at Ohio's Sonic Temple Festival, the pyrotechnic effects of the show have projected flames in his face under the effect of the wind. Burned superficially, Andreu had to leave his comrades but returned on stage to complete the concert, while taking breaks between songs to throw water on his face. He recovered quickly.
