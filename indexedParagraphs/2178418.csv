",1,== Biography ==
"Michael Sheridan was born and raised in Melbourne. In the 1970s, whilst still at secondary school, he became fascinated by the guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix and others. He has been a member of several bands since 1975. Sheridan moved to Sydney to further his interest in improvised music. In 1982 he formed a jazz - punk outfit, Great White Noise, which included Sandy Evans, Diane Spence, Lenny Bastiaans, Tony Buck, John Gillies,  soon followed by an improvisation group, Slaughter House 3, with Jon Rose and John Gillies. By the mid-1980s Sheridan had moved back to Melbourne and formed Transwaste with Jamie Fielding and Peter Jones. He also played in Whaddya Want? with David Chesworth.
",2,== Biography ==
"In 1987 Sheridan, on lead guitar, joined an electro-punk band, No, with Marie Hoy on keyboards and samples, Kevin McMahon on bass guitar and Ollie Olsen on vocals, samples and keyboards. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as ""the ultimate crossover act due to its confrontational fusion of hardcore energy, abrasive heavy metal guitar riffs, electro-funk beats and acid-house grooves."" Sheridan and Olsen also work with Michael Hutchence (of INXS) in Max Q (1989–90). While still a member of No, Sheridan formed Dumb and the Ugly (1987–93) with John Murphy on drums and noise tapes (ex-the Wreckery) and David Brown on bass guitar. In 1990 Sheridan released a solo CD, Scaleshack, utilising sampling and dub techniques. Soon after he joined Peril, with Tony Buck, Otomo Yoshihide, and Kato Hideki. From 1991 to 1993 he was also a member of RAW with Barry Deenik on bass guitar, Ross Wilson on lead vocals (ex-Mondo Rock) and Craig Waugh on drums (ex-Uncanny X-Men). McFarlane observed that they ""played an aggressive blend of rock and funk but, aside from building up a strong cult following on the Australian pub circuit, the band did not issue any recordings before breaking up.""Sheridan's next solo CD, Digital Jamming, was released in 1996 also features performances by Jon Rose and Jim Denley. Both Scaleshack and Digital Jamming were later re-released by Shame File Music.  Sheridan also studied and completed a Bachelor of Music degree at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music 2000, and qualified as a teacher and composer. In March 2012 a quartet with Sheridan on eight-string guitar, Chris Abrahams on piano, John Gillies on percussion and Jon Rose on violin performed and recorded Improvisation at People's Republic in Sydney.
