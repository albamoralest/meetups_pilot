"U.S. Girls is a Toronto-based experimental pop project formed in 2007, consisting solely of American musician and record producer Meghan Remy. She had released music on a variety of independent record labels before signing to 4AD in 2015. Half Free, her first record for 4AD, was released the same year. It garnered a Juno Award nomination for Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2016, and was a shortlisted finalist for the 2016 Polaris Music Prize. Remy collaborates with a number of Toronto-based musicians on both songwriting and music production.

"Remy grew up in Illinois and attended a Catholic high school. She was raised mostly by her mother. She was in her first punk band as a teenager. She cites Riot grrrl and Crass as some of her early influences. She attended an art college in Oregon, concentrating on paper arts and graphic design. The name ""U.S. Girls"" originated from a casual conversation she was having with a friend talking about a European band coming to town. She joked, ""Wait 'til they get a look at these U.S. girls!"" and the phrase stuck.
