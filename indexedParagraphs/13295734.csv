"As a music ghostwriter for director Michel Magne, Petit did not get credit for his film scores until he was 36.1979 saw his first major film soundtrack commission (Alexandro Jodorowsky's Tusk), but he had been releasing solo records at least a decade earlier, including at least four for the Chappell Music Library, as well as his album Chez Jean-Claude Petit, released in the early 1970s. In 1976 he collaborated with Pierre Delanoë, Toto Cutugno, Vito Pallavicini in a very popular and funky music for Mireille Mathieu called Ciao Bambino, Sorry. In addition, he was a frequent collaborator with French film music composer Jack Arel: the pair's most well-known production, ""Psychedelic Portrait"", was featured in an episode of the cult TV series The Prisoner. His scores for The Return of the Musketeers (1989) and Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) remain perhaps his best known work internationally. In 1995 he was nominated for a Victoires de la Musique award in soundtrack of the year for L'Etudiante Etranger.

The 'Greatest Country Hits' Lp Paramount PAS 6044 also includes a Jean Claude original ""Walk A Country Mile"".
