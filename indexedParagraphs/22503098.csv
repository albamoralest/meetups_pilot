"While on stage, Nobunny dresses (and undresses) in a bunny mask that is often accompanied by other odd stage-attire choices, such as raw meat, weaves, ball gags, firecrackers, panties, knee pads and coats made of trash. Nobunny released a vinyl single, ""Give it to Me"", on HoZac Records and a full-length LP, Love Visions, on Bubbledumb Records in 2008. Love Visions was later re-released on 1-2-3-4 Go! Records in 2009 on vinyl and CD. Since the release of his debut LP, Nobunny has been featured in multiple magazines nationwide and has developed a solid fan base across the world. Burger Records released Raw Romance in 2009 on cassette only. Raw Romance contains a few alternate recordings of previous works and several new songs. The initial release was limited to 500 hand-numbered copies on white or blue cassette tapes. It has subsequently been pressed on vinyl and CD. Burger Records has also issued the Love Visions album on cassette twice: once as Love Visions, and once as a split cassette featuring both Love Visions and Raw Romance. Burger Records is also scheduled to put out First Blood on tape and donate the profits to charity.
