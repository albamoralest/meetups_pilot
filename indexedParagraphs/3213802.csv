"Wilder's debut album, I Don't Speak the Language (1983), reached No. 49 on the Billboard 200, fueled by ""Break My Stride"".  Wilder had some continued success with the single ""The Kid's American"", which reached No. 33 in 1984, but the single failed to match the success of ""Break My Stride"".  Wilder's second album, Bouncin' Off the Walls (1984), failed to gain much momentum—even with an innovative music video for the single ""Bouncin' Off the Walls"", with only the title track making the charts (No. 52), and was subsequently deemed a commercial failure.

"Despite the downturn in his solo career, Wilder continued his career in the music industry as a songwriter and as a record producer for such acts as No Doubt (the hit album Tragic Kingdom), 702, Christina Aguilera, Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus on her Hannah Montana song ""G.N.O. (Girls Night Out)"", The Belle Brigade, King Charles, and Joanna Pacitti. He has also done production work on Australian singer-songwriter Mig Ayesa's self-titled album released in April 2007 and has helped with production on Hayden Panettiere's unreleased album.

"For the Disney film Mulan, Wilder wrote the songs and co-wrote the score with composer Jerry Goldsmith. Wilder also lent his singing voice to the character of Ling. He won an Annie Award nomination for Music in an Animated Feature Production, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score (along with David Zippel and Jerry Goldsmith) for his work on that film. For theatre, Wilder once again paired with Zippel to provide the music and lyrics for Princesses, a musical comedy update of Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel A Little Princess.  The production ran at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle but has yet to open on Broadway.
