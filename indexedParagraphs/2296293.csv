"After graduating from orchestral conducting in La Plata, he was hired by Les Luthiers to play the fiddlecan (a violin made of tuna can), and famously learnt the repertoire in two days (around 1970). For the next season, he started a songwriting partnership with Jorge Maronna, and they penned 'Pieza en Forma de Tango'; he also composed 'Voglio Entrare Per la Finestra' (with libretto by Marcos Mundstock) and around June 1971 he was invited to be a group member rather than a paid collaborator. During the first years in Les Luthiers, López-Puccio played other instruments such as cello, viola and percussion, and he often provided backing vocals. He also composed all the music for many pieces for the group, including 'Concierto de Mpkstroff' (which features group-mate Carlos Núñez Cortés as soloist) and 'Brotan und Gretchen'. He slowly gained notoriety scripting jokes for his groupmates as well as occasional song lyrics.

"From 1979 onwards he also played piano, synthesiser and harmonica for several musical pieces, especially since Ernesto Acher left the group, and they started including electronic keyboards more often. He also became more and more involved as an actor, having several starring parts from the 80's onwards.
