"Marc Bianchi began as a musician in the California hardcore scene. He was a part of Indian Summer and Mohinder before assuming the moniker ""Her Space Holiday"" in 1996. Initially, Bianchi was not interested in releasing Her Space Holiday's first works, as he was focused on launching the bands associated with his new (now defunct) record label Audio Information Phenomena. However, after being approached by Chocolate River Industries to record a 12"" EP, Her Space Holiday became Bianchi's full-time project.
",2,== History ==
"Since the release of Her Space Holiday's first EP, the band has released six full-length albums, several singles and EPs, and a remix album. He has toured with Bright Eyes, The Faint, Pinback, Bob Mould, The American Analog Set, Lymbyc Systym and others. He has also remixed songs from REM, Duster, The Faint, The American Analog Set, Xiu Xiu, and others.

"Released on October 7, 2008 in the United States, XOXO, Panda And The New Kid Revival is a departure from previous Her Space Holiday albums and with a new, less electronically oriented sound.  Bianchi brings a folk and jam feel and instrumentation to the material, with emphasis on songwriting. The live band for the Xoxo Panda material features Andrew Kenny of American Analog Set and Mike Bell & Jared Bell of Lymbyc Systym. This was followed with the release of a self-titled album on August 16, 2011, along with the announcement that this would be the last album from Her Space Holiday. Sometime in 2017 it was announced through the official website that Her Space Holiday would be ending its six year hiatus and releasing an EP during Summer 2017. The EP, Gravity, was released in January 2018.
