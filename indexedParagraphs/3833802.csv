"Burrows was born into a musical family. Jeff's father John, a police official and lawyer in Jeff's hometown of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, was a drummer for Bobby Curtola in the 1960s. John Burrows also backed Motown artists while on the road and has met Berry Gordy, founder of Motown Records. John Burrows was a drumming teacher while still in his teens in his hometown of Chatham, Ontario, approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Windsor. Jeff Burrows' first musical experiences were on the piano, then at eleven years of age he purchased his first drum kit - an old Motown drummer's set of Ludwig drums before graduating to a set of Ludwig Rockers for his Detroit-based band Vavoom! This kit ultimately morphed into his first for The Tea Party.

"Burrows signed a cymbal deal with Sabian in 1994, just after The Tea Party's first major-label album Splendor Solis was released. Burrows states that he chose Sabian because ""you're getting the same quality as Zildjian but you're getting a company that's more innovative and not in a bad technological way... they still do hand-hammered cymbals.""

"With The Tea Party's overseas touring schedule increasing, having a drum kit available became very important.  Burrows was solicited by many companies but decided on Drum Workshop, Burrows explains it is because of their ""quality and durability"" and ""that they would supply me with a drum kit to spec in any country that we traveled to, free of charge"" and that ""there isn't much of a difference between any of the drums when you are endorsed because they're going to give you the high-end line no matter what, so for me it was about choosing a reputable drum company that is going to provide me with what I need.
