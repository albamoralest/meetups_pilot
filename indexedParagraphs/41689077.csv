"The Isokon is the name of Goodwin's private recording studio, located in Woodstock, New York. The facility was finished in Spring of 2010, and will be Goodwin's homebase for the foreseeable future. While the studio is private, it is occasionally available to rent out on a limited basis, when Goodwin is working elsewhere or away.
",4,== The Isokon ==
"Known primarily for his quirky approach to recording, The Isokon follows that mindset. With a bevy of strange instruments and technical devices, the facility is installed in an mid century residential home, and set up in such a way that artists are made to feel as though they are away in vacation in the woods of upstate NY, surrounded by numerous instruments, toys, and manipulation devices, aimed at assisting Goodwin in making adventurous recordings, without worrying about the clock, or the time constraints of a typical studio.
