"Marcela Rodríguez was born in Mexico City. She studied the guitar  and composition with Leo Brouwer of Cuba. She studied for a while in London, and then returned to Mexico City to study with Julio Estrada and Ma. Antonieta Lozano, Rodríguez works have been performed internationally, including the United States, Venezuela, Spain, her opera ""Las Cartas de Frida"" in Heidelberg, Germany, Moldavia and Greece. She has taught classes of composition for opera, dance and theater in Mexico and Spain, and at the Catholic University of Colombia and the Catholic University of Washington. Her music composition is usually associated with natural landscapes, human nature and different cultures. Although she has received most of her music education in Mexico with Mexican composers, she claims that her music is not associated with Latin American music. By combining different cultures, her music presents a unique style that contains many music elements from different countries. European culture influences her  music the most, once she said “Spain is part of my life”.

"Marcela Rodríguez’s work Asilah combines Arabian and Spanish cultures. The musical development in this piece reflects the geography from north Morocco, the border to Spain, to south in Morocco. The music style in this piece changes from Spanish culture gradually into Arabic culture. Asilah has the similar concept with her recent work El Horizonte which is based on natural landscape.
