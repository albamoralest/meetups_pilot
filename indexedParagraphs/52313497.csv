"Vogt was born in Lafayette, Indiana. From an early age, his parents exposed him to a wide variety of music, encompassing many genres and styles. Vogt began studying piano at five years of age under the guidance of a traditional classical pianist. Vogt moved to Austria with his parents when he was six years old, continuing his study of classical music on piano. The classical recitals, competitions and concerts he performed in all influenced the performance-orientated nature of his later work. Vogt moved back to the United States in 2006, and later went to study at Augsberg College, where he was exposed to a wider repertoire of jazz and classical music, as well as more electronic artists. Vogt first started to gain an online following when he began uploading original tracks and remixes to Newgrounds in 2009. These first tracks had an ambient/instrumental hip hop style, with later works including influences from dubstep producers such as Noisia.

"After the release of Two Fold Pt. 1, Vogt began working more closely with Monstercat, and during his second year of college, he interned for the label at their offices in Vancouver.

The video, which has been viewed over 3.4 million times, was uploaded to his YouTube channel on July 10, 2014.

"In November 2017, Vogt moved back to the United States. After the release of the singles ""Tell Me"" and ""Storyteller"", Vogt released the EP, Panorama: Discover on November 30, 2018. This was revealed to be the first EP in a six-part concept series entitled ""Panorama"". The themes of these EPs will be ""Discover, Form, Fragment, Control, Resolve and Fulfill"". Matthew Meadow of Your EDM praised the Discover EP, saying ""Haywyre fans from any period of his career are sure to love Discover, as it blends his classic jazz knowledge with blazing electronic flourishes and pizazz... it offers up some bouncy funk and groove like no other.""On February 22, 2019, Vogt released the second EP in the Panorama series, titled ""Form"". These two EPs were accompanied by a headlining North American Discover/Form tour. Vogt stated that returning to release independently gave him more creative control over the entire musical process, enabling him to try new styles and genres without having to fit in with the industry. The Discover and Form EPs both explore the performance element of Vogt's music, with each single having its own performance video released alongside. These EPs also place an emphasis on a new, funk driven style, which ""bridges the gap between music production and music performance"".
