"Ringer started her professional career on stage in the late 1970s in productions with Michael Lonsdale's Théâtre de Recherche Musicale as well as musical and dance productions. In 1976, she met the Argentine dancer and choreographer Marcia Moretto with whom she studied and also performed in various venues in Paris. The hit song ""Marcia Baïla"" was written as a tribute to Moretto after her death in 1981. On film, Ringer also performed in pornographic films such as La Fessée (1976) and Body Love (1977). In the same period she also undertook some pornography work for the Color Climax Corporation, notably a 1980 magazine photoshoot demonstrating urolagnia and coprophagia. In 1979, she met Fred Chichin with whom she founded and co-led the music group Les Rita Mitsouko. Ringer continued leading the group after Chichin's death in November 2007.
