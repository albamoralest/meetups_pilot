It was premiered by Phil Taggart on BBC Radio 1 on 10 March 2019 where it was revealed as the ""Chillest Record"".

"Shura's music has been described as ""infectious but melancholy electropop"" as well as ""slow-burning synth-pop"" but has said that pop music ""didn't represent"" her. The singer has said that ""missed opportunity, regret, nostalgia"" are some of the main themes in her work.
