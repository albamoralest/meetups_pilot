"Nazir Khan was born in the 1840s to a family of Khandarbani dhrupad musicians based in Agra. His grandfather was Dada Tikkad. He was trained in singing and rudra veena by his father, Imam Khan, and uncle, Wazir Khan, alongside his younger brother, Ghagge Nazir Khan. Wahid Khan continued his training with Bande Ali Khan and became one of only two of his anointed disciples. Consequently, Wahid Khan is often affiliated with Bande Ali Khan's traditions, Kirana and Dagarbani, but forged his own path through the Mewati gharana, grounded in the earlier Khandarbani tradition.
