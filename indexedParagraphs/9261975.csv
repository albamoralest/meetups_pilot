His grandfather, Rule Oliver, trombonist, for 50 years was a junior high school band director in Arkansas; his father, Rule Curtis Beasley, music educator, in 1963 won 1st prize in Composition at the Southeastern Composers League in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; his mother, Lida Beasley, brass instrumentalist, was a band director, conducted operas and taught music in various public schools and colleges. He approached music at the age of eight by studying piano, but in his teens he played guitar, drums, saxophone, trumpet and oboe. Returning to piano and jazz, at the age of twenty he performed his first major concert at Carnegie Hall with Hubert Laws, John Patitucci and the drummer Joey Heredia. During the 1970s, he performed jazz and R&B in Los Angeles. He toured with Sergio Mendes, then worked as a studio musician. For several years he was a member of band led by Freddie Hubbard. In 1992 his album Cauldron was released by Windham Hill.
