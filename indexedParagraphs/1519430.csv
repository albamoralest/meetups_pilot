"Raised in Lexington, Massachusetts, Staines began his professional career in the early 1960s in the Cambridge area. He began touring nationwide a few years later. In 1975, he won the National Yodeling Championship at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas. He performed about 200 times a year and appeared on A Prairie Home Companion, Mountain Stage, and The Good Evening Show. Staines's songs include ""Bridges"", ""Crossing the Water"", ""Sweet Wyoming Home"", ""The Roseville Fair"", ""A Place in the Choir"", ""Child of Mine"", and ""River"". They have been recorded by many other artists, including Peter, Paul and Mary, Makem and Clancy, Nanci Griffith, Mason Williams, The Highwaymen, Glenn Yarbrough, Skip Jones, Jerry Jeff Walker, Schooner Fare, Grandpa Jones, The Grace Family, Hank Cramer, Coty Hogue, Wendy M. Grossman and Priscilla Herdman. He recorded 22 albums, 15 of which were still in print as of 2005. Staines's songs have been published in four songbooks: If I Were a Word, Then I'd Be a Song (1980); River; Music to Me: The Songs of Bill Staines; and All God's Critters Got a Place in the Choir. Staines was left-handed and played a right-handed guitar upside-down, with the bass strings on the bottom. Consequently, he developed his own fingerings and picking style.
