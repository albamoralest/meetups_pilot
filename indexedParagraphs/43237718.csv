"Prunty grew up in Scarborough, Maine, but now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He played in his high school band, and was always interested in composing music using computers, but lacked musical expertise until preparing to compose the FTL soundtrack. He also grew up playing video games and recalls thinking making music for them would be the ""coolest job ever"". He attended the New England School of Communications for audio engineering and picked up some skills he would put to use later.
