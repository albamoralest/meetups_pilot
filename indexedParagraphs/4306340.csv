"Devine originally worked for Tony Brainsby, a publicist for Queen, Thin Lizzy, and Whitesnake. While still living with boyfriend (ex Generation X (band) bassist) Tony James, she became the music promoter for James's new band Sigue Sigue Sputnik. She began her television career in 1986 as a presenter of BBC Wales's pop music show Juice.  Following her breakup with James, producer Janet Street-Porter booked Devine to be a presenter on Channel 4's youth programme Network 7. She then moved after Street-Porter to BBC2 to present DEF II, of which Rough Guide was a feature before it became a separate programme. Devine appeared on Richard & Judy in 2004, and on Extreme Celebrity Detox in 2005. Her voice-over work included advertisements for Peugeot, Motorola, Toyota, and Sea France. In 2006, Devine fronted an Office of Fair Trading (OFT) campaign that urged consumers in the travel market to book with a member of Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA). In 2001, she narrated a BBC Four programme, The New Romantics – A Fine Romance, on the New Romantic movement. Apart from being a television presenter, she also was UN Goodwill Ambassador in 1998, and campaigned for women's equality and reproductive rights.
