"In the early 1940s, he had a radio show on WHN radio in New York called Sam Medoff and His Yiddish Swing Orchestra; he performed with his band, ""The Yiddish Swingtet"". Manning and the band were also regulars on ""Yiddish Melodies in Swing"", which was also broadcast on WHN. The 15 minute weekly radio show, which blended traditional Yiddish folk music with swing and jazz, got its start on the station in 1938. Medoff and the Swingtet were hired to give a new twist to the traditional songs, as well as introduce new popular songs performed in Yiddish. The Barry Sisters (Claire and Merna) were the vocalists for the program. The radio show was originally done live at the Lowes State Theatre every Sunday at 1PM; it aired until 1955. Medoff also played piano and organ for Yiddish crooner Seymour Rexite's radio show.

"Manning was the co-writer of many popular songs, among them: ""Takes Two to Tango"", ""Fascination"", ""Hot Diggity"" and ""Papa Loves Mambo"". They were recorded by artists such as Perry Como, Sammy Kaye, Kate Smith and others. Manning's songs have been published in 27 languages. In 1956, Manning shared a late-night subway ride with Perry Como's music publisher, Mickey Glass.  As the two men talked, Glass mentioned a need for a new novelty song for Como.  Manning said he had just made a demo recording of something like that which had yet to be heard by anyone else.  Glass arranged to hear Manning's demo the next day; Como's recording of ""Hot Diggity"" was the result of that chance meeting of Manning and Glass. Manning also composed The Boys From Boise, which was the story of a troupe of show girls who were stranded on an Idaho ranch. The girls take jobs as cowgirls on the ranch in an effort to raise enough money to return home. This was the first full-length television musical, and was presented on the DuMont Television Network in 1944. The television presentation of the musical was sponsored by Esquire magazine. Manning appeared earlier in that year on DuMont's Key-Bored Televisual Presentations as a pianist. Manning also was an arranger and vocal coach, and wrote radio jingles. Manning, the father of two daughters and a son, died of diabetes-related complications in Marietta, Georgia on April 11, 1991.
