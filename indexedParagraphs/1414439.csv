"The German rock band Fury in the Slaughterhouse uses Susanna's AC/DC-cover of ""It's a Long Way to the Top If You Wanna Rock'n Roll"" as intro and the Joy-Division-cover ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" as Outro on their ""Farewell & Goodbye Tour 2008"". Susanna Wallumrød has cooperated with baroque harpist Giovanna Pessi, who has previously made herself known with a variety of ECM recordings. Pessi's collaboration with pianist Christian Wallumrød brought her regularly to Oslo, where she met and became friends with Susanna, the pianist's sister. Susanna invited Pessi to play on her solo album Sonata Mix Dwarf Cosmos (2008), and four years later, the Norwegian vocalist's turn to take guest role. On If Grief Could Wait she sings both her own songs and compositions by Henry Purcell, Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake. In the center of the album is Susannas clear voice and Pessis delicate harp. The ensemble also comprises Marco Ambrosini on Key harp and Jan Achtman at Gamba. A bright meeting between Tord Gustavsen's strong Norwegian Quartet and Susanna Wallumrød, brings one of our most distinctive vocalists to the premiere of a new musical project during the Oslo Jazz Festival 2012. The musical movements that Wallumrød sings, are previously done with singers of Trio Mediaeval and Tord Gustavsen Trio. Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones joined Susanna and Deathprod at Øya-festialen 2013.
