"When Papa Roach drummer Dave Buckner was sent to rehab in 2007, the band asked Tony Palermo if he would be willing to play drums for the band live. During the tour, the band formed a relationship with Palermo. In January 2008, when Dave left the band for good, Papa Roach asked Tony to be the band's permanent drummer. It was the band's first line-up change since 1996, also the first since signing with a major label. Tony is featured on six of Papa Roach's albums; Metamorphosis, Time for Annihilation, The Connection, F.E.A.R., Crooked Teeth and ""Who Do You Trust?"". In combination as member from Papa Roach, Tony was also a touring drummer for Sixx:A.M. while the band was on the Cr√ºe Fest tour along with Papa Roach.
