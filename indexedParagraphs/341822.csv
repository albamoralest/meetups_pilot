"Peter Garland (born January 25, 1952 in Portland, Maine) is a composer, writer and publisher of Soundings Press. A student of James Tenney and Harold Budd, much of Garland's work could be considered post-minimal although many of his postminimal works such as ""The Days Run Away"" (1971) were written in the early 1970s at the same time as the first minimalist works. He is also an expert on Native American music, and on the music of Silvestre Revueltas. He is the author of Gone Walkabout: Essays 1991-. Garland started his Soundings Press series in 1971 after attending a publishing workshop with Dick Higgins at CalArts.
