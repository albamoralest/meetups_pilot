"The Nervo twins were born in Ivanhoe, Melbourne on the night of 18 February 1982. In 2012, the twins told a reporter that they ""almost have the same birthday"", but in 2021 they said they share a birthday. Olivia was born first. The twins were reported 27 years old in December 2009, putting their birth year at 1982. Their parents were Dr. Flaviana Benedetti and Dr. Garry Nervo who had established a dental practice together in 1975 in Whittlesea, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne. The Italian-heritage family included older sister Adele Nervo and younger brother Morris Nervo. Around 1992 the family moved to Ivanhoe, Victoria. The twins studied at Genazzano FCJ College, a girls school in Kew, where they participated in rowing and swimming, but were mainly involved in music. They completed Year 12 and graduated in 1999. The twins began their careers as models with the Australian Chadwick Models Agency.

"When the sisters were sixteen, a modeling agency took an interest in the pair, but Liv Nervo stated in April 2012 that music ""was always the focus"" for them. The sisters were accepted into the Opera Australia Academy, but decided to pursue a music career instead. A contract was then signed with Sony/ATV Music Publishing and the duo subsequently embarked on a songwriting career. Initial recognition for the pair occurred following the single ""Negotiate with Love"", written for British pop singer, Rachel Stevens, which reached tenth position in the United Kingdom (UK) music charts in 2005. Also in 2005, the duo released the single ""Boobjob"", which received substantial airplay in their native Australia. The duo went on to write for Kesha, Richard Grey, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Ashley Tisdale and the Pussycat Dolls. When their publishing deal was set to expire they considered dropping their songwriting career due to a dissatisfaction with the modest level of success they had experienced while with the major publisher. Instead they were persuaded to give it another chance by signing with Fredrik Olsson (Music Executive) and his Swedish music publishing company Razor Boy Music Publishing in 2008. The move reaped quick rewards when the new publisher arranged a writing session with Kelly Rowland through Universal A&R Max Gousse. The group co-wrote Guetta and Rowland's number one dance hit, ""When Love Takes Over"" which went on to win a Grammy Award, in addition to reaching the top position on numerous charts around the world. The song was also ranked the No. 1 dance pop collaboration of all time by Billboard.
