"Reginald Lucien Frank Roger Watts was born in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, on March 23, 1972, the only child of French mother Christiane and African-American father Charles Alphonso Watts. His father was an officer in the U.S. Air Force. The family lived in Germany, Italy, Spain and France before relocating to Great Falls, Montana, where Watts was raised. Watts graduated from Great Falls High School in 1990. He began piano and violin lessons at age 5. Watts' love of music began as a young child when he saw Ray Charles play the piano on television. Watts moved to Seattle, Washington at the age of 18 to study music. He attended the Art Institute of Seattle before studying jazz at Cornish College of the Arts. Watts played with the neo-soul band Maktub.

"In 1996, Watts became the front man for soul, rock, and hip hop group Maktub. While recording and touring circa 1996–2000 with Wayne Horvitz 4+1 Ensemble as a keyboardist, Watts was forced to downsize his effects pedal from a Roland Space Echo tape delay to a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler, a smaller device that makes it easy to travel. He began using the Line 6 in live shows with Maktub, in order to replicate the duplicate harmonies from the recorded material. He experimented with improvising entire songs in solo acts with the Line 6, while trying to sound like Tom Waits, playing initial gigs at small Seattle venues and artist bungalows. While in Seattle, Watts composed musical scores for Northwest dance choreographers and he dabbled in sketch comedy with future theatrical collaborator Tommy Smith. In 2004, after recording five albums over eight years, Watts moved to the Lower East Side, New York City. In 2005, he recorded his first solo single, ""So Beautiful"". Inspired by The State and Wet Hot American Summer, he began infusing spontaneous comedic material with the beat-box-driven musical compositions. He shot comedic web shorts for Superdeluxe, Vimeo and CollegeHumor.

"== Performance style ==
",21,== Performance style ==
"Watts utilizes improvisation in his solo shows and consist of him singing and rapping both with words and with sound poetry, accompanying himself by either beatboxing, performing vocal basslines into a loop machine, or simply by playing the keyboard. His act also showcases his trademark style of standup comedy, consisting of him rapidly alternating between topics of discussion in both rational and nonsensical manners, making random sounds and noises, and speaking in other accents, languages, and gibberish at unexpected times, all with the intent of playfully and comically disorienting his audiences. He has a four and a half octave vocal range, and adopts a wide variety of voices and accents.
