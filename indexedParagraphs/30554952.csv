She began her organ studies with Prof. Jan Hora, together with piano lessons given by Prof. Eliška Kleinová and Prof. Arnoštka Grünfeldová. Irena Kosíková studied organ performance (Prof. Jaroslava Potměšilová) and conducting (with Prof. Karel Fiala) at Ježek's Conservatory. She was refused further studies for political reasons. She took private composition lessons with Prof. Miroslav Raichl.

She graduated at the Academy of Music (HAMU) in Prague, under the guidance of Prof. Josef Popelka. Irena Kosíková now gives organ concerts and is also intensively composing. Her works have been performed in the Czech Republic, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Israel, Poland, Russia, Turkey, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
