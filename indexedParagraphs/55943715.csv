He also competed in the 3rd season of One Million Star, which was won by Lala Hsu, but he was eliminated before the top 100. In 2010, while working part-time at the coffee shop Kafka by the Sea in Gongguan, he met drummer Bearpa and bassist Kabei. Together, they formed the band hush! Starting out acoustic, they transitioned into electric after playing many live shows. Usually, Hush records the demo and uploads to StreetVoice, a music-publishing platform for independent songwriters. His songs are inspired by his interests in astronomy, psychology, and tarot. Within a year, they released an EP, Astronomical Cachet 『天文特徵』, and an album, X. Popular in the indie scene, the band performed at various events and venues in Xi'an, Shenzhen, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Kaohsiung. After the band disbanded in 2014, HUSH started his solo career. His first single was produced by Mayday bassist Masa.
