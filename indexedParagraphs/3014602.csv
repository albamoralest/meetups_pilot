"Kate Havnevik is the child of classical flautists Andrew Cunningham and Lotte Havnevik. She can play the piano, the guitar, and the melodica amongst other instruments. Earlier in life, she aspired to be a classical and jazz musician, much like her parents, who are both classically trained musicians. At 14, her goals shifted when she joined an all female punk rock band, rehearsing and playing at Oslo's illegally occupied club Blitz. The experience led her to pursue an interest in classical music mixed with modern electronica.

"Havnevik set about working with producers to help hone her sound, the most famous of whom is Guy Sigsworth, part of Frou Frou, who has also worked with Imogen Heap, Madonna, Jem, Britney Spears, Björk and Alanis Morissette. Havnevik tracked down Sigsworth around in 2000, rang him and left phone messages, until one day he agreed to meet her. The pair have co-written and recorded many songs together, some of which have been featured on Melankton, including ""Unlike Me"", ""Not Fair"" and ""You Again"", and some of which will be included on Havnevik's second album 'You', including ""Disobey"", which Havnevik premiered on her official web site. She describes Melankton as ""dramatic, beautiful and euphoric"", and deemed it the perfect introduction to her music, which is why it is being released first. The album title is from a character in a Norwegian book Havnevik was reading, and also translates to ""black rose"", which she says is very fitting for the album. Melankton was mastered in Devon, partly mixed in Los Angeles, partly mixed and recorded in London, Bratislava, Oslo, Reykjavík and Los Angeles. The album was premiered online on Havnevik's official web site for 48 hours from 11–12 March 2006, and was added to Apple Computer's iTunes music store on 27 March 2006. It was commercially released on CD on 3 April in Norway; a special UK edition, omitting ""Someday"", and instead including ""Travel In Time"", was released on 16 October 2006. The US edition, featuring a new song titled ""Timeless"", was released in the United States on 27 March 2007 exactly one year after its iTunes release.
