"Moore was born in Brixton, London, England. His father was in the US military, and his mother was English. He grew up in Brixton, and after trying various instruments, took up the tenor saxophone at the age of 14. In 1972, he moved to Santa Maria, California, to live with his father. ""Around 1975 he moved to Boston, where he played locally and attended the Berklee College of Music. His studies were interrupted when his apartment was robbed and he was shot and seriously wounded, and he never received a degree.""
