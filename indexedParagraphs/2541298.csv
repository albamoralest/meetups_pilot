At the start of the performance of ""Yo!"", he was shot up on stage but did not land safely. He ruptured his cruciate ligament and severely damaged the cartilage and ligament surrounding the meniscus, requiring surgery and six weeks of rest. Shin had previously ruptured his cruciate ligament again, an injury previously sustained during a concert in 2001, and had corrective surgery on his left knee but the cruciate ligament in his right knee continued to suffer damage, for which he was exempt from mandatory military service. However, he has put off surgery, but has continued treatment through the end of promotional activities for Shinhwa's tenth studio album, The Return. He performed by singing in a chair for their first music show comeback on March 29 on M! Countdown, where they performed ""Venus"" and ""Hurt"".
