"Candye was accepted into the University of Southern California's music conservatory's junior opera program in 1976, but she disliked opera and dropped out. She became part of the punk rock music scene of the early 1980s. She started country punk bands and befriended and shared the stage with musicians as diverse as Black Flag, Social Distortion, James Harman, The Circle Jerks, Los Lobos, The Blasters and Lone Justice. In 1985, she caught the attention of CBS/Epic A&R Head, Larry Hanby. She was signed to a developmental deal and recorded her first demo with Grammy winner Val Garay. Kane was marketed as a country singer, but CBS dropped her upon learning of her controversial past. At 17, Kane became pregnant with her first son. In 1986, she moved from Los Angeles to San Diego. She married bass player Thomas Yearsley (of rockabilly power trio The Paladins), with whom she had another son.

"Kane majored in women's studies at Palomar Community College. She continued to write songs and discovered the brash blues stylings of Big Maybelle, Ruth Brown, Big Mama Thornton, Etta James and Bessie Smith. In 1991, she self-released Burlesque Swing, her first recording since A Town South of Bakersfield. In 1992, she was signed by Clifford Antone to a record deal with Antones Records. Her first CD, Home Cookin', was produced by Yearsley, Cesar Rosas (of Los Lobos), and Dave Gonzales. It was released in 1992 followed by Knock Out. She then signed with Discovery Records, releasing Diva La Grande, produced by Dave Alvin and Derek O'Brien. Next, she was signed by record mogul Seymour Stein to Sire Records during the height of the swing revival. Candye released Swango, which was produced by Mike Vernon for Sire/London Records; it was her only major label release. This was followed by her Rounder/Bullseye release, The Toughest Girl Alive, produced by Scott Billington. Next she released four CDs on the German Label Ruf Records. Subsequent titles included Whole Lotta Love, produced by Val Garay and White Trash Girl, produced in Austin by Ruf Records and Mark Kazanoff. In 2007, she released Guitar'd and Feathered on Ruf Records. The CD was produced by former Muddy Waters guitarist Bob Margolin. In 2009, she signed to Delta Groove Productions and released Superhero in June 2009. She made a ""topless"" video for the song ""All You Can Eat"" during which she pounded the keyboards with her bare breasts. She dropped this routine from her act after her first bout with cancer, which caused her to lose over 100 pounds and reduced her bust from 44H to 38D. A stage play about Kane's life debuted at San Diego's Diversionary Theatre in January 2009, directed by Javier Velasco. The play, titled The Toughest Girl Alive, was based on Kane's memoir about her turbulent life. She was included on the 30 Essential Women of the Blues CD set released by the House of Blues record label and the Rock for Choice compilation. She appeared with Lucinda Williams and Dwight Yoakam on Town South of Bakersfield on Enigma Records.
