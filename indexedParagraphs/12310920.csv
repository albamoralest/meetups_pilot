"Richard Thurston (born January 6, 1973), usually referred to as ""Rich Thurston"" is an American musician, songwriter, recording engineer and mixed martial artist. Thurston was born in Florida and most notably performed in several bands from around the Broward County and Miami-Dade County area. He has also lived in and performed with bands from Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, California, Michigan and Ohio, the latter of which has been his home since the late 1990s. Thurston is a multi-instrumentalist musician and vocalist, having performed guitar, bass and drums in addition to vocals in several of his bands. He has also been straight-edge and vegan since the early 1990s, participating in several bands that vocalized those beliefs and ethics. Thurston began training as a mixed martial artist in 2003. During his inaugural amateur fight on November 5, 2004, he dislocated his elbow while against opponent Joshua Blanchard. In November 2006, Thurston became a professional fighter.
