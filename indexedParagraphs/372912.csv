"Srirangam Srinivasa Rao was the first true modern Telugu poet to write about contemporary issues that affected the day-to-day life of a common man in a style and metre which were not used in classical Telugu poetry. He wrote visionary poems in a style and meter not used before in Telugu classical poetry. He moved poetry forward from traditional mythological themes to reflect more contemporary issues. The essence of his personality was captured by Gudipati Venkatachalam when he compared him with the great romantic Telugu poet Devulapalli Krishnasastri: “While Krishna Sastry made his anguish known to the whole world,  Sri Sri spoke in his voice about the anguish of the whole world. Krishna Sastry's pain was the pain of the world, while the world's pain became Sri Sri's pain.”
