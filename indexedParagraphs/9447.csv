"Most of the Egyptian Lover's successful recordings were 12"" singles. He eventually released some of the earliest rap LPs, but they were less popular than his singles. On the strength of an alternate mix of his most popular single ""Egypt, Egypt"", 1984's On the Nile was moderately successful. After a break in the early 1990s, Egyptian Lover returned in 1994 with Back from the Tomb, his first full-length album in over ten years.
