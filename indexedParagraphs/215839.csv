"Charli Baltimore began her musical career when she met The Notorious B.I.G. in the summer of 1995, and they became involved in a romantic relationship. Several months into their relationship, she left him a voicemail of a rap verse that she had written and he began encouraging her to pursue a career in rap music. Following the death of B.I.G., Charli continued her career in the industry, booking several modeling jobs and creating a number of hip-hop and R&B songs including ""Money"", with Gamble and Huff, and ""Stand Up"", which rose to the top ten of Billboard Magazine's Hot Rap Singles Chart. Despite her moderate success on the charts, Baltimore's first studio album Cold as Ice was never released yet she continued to be in the rap industry and joined Irv Gotti's label Murder Inc in 2002. It was here that Baltimore made appearances in songs such as; ""Down 4 U"", ""We Still Don't Give a Fuck"", and ""No One Does It Better"" from Irv Gotti Presents The Inc, Ja Rule tracks ""Down Ass Bitch"" and ""The Last Temptation"", the Christina Milian track ""Spending Time"", and Ashanti's ""Rain on Me"" (remix). In 2003, she earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rap Solo Performance, for her single  ""Diary"".
