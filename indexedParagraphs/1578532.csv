"Born in Madison, Wisconsin, to father Dr. Terry Hexum and mother Pat, Hexum went to Westside High School in Omaha, Nebraska. There he played in the school's concert jazz band, and played in several local bands like ""The Extras"", ""The Eds"", ""The Right Profile"". In the 1988, Nick moved to Los Angeles to pursue music with his band ""Unity"", including Chad Sexton, Ward Bones, Marcus Watkins. This group split ways. Nick moved to Germany for a brief stint in 1990 when he got a call from Chad. He was back in Omaha and his band ""Fish Hippos"" had a gig with Fugazi and invited Nick to join the band. Nick agreed, but said they needed to change the name of the band. At that show, they announced from stage that their name was 311.

"311 began playing together in 1990. Hexum was considered the bands default manager and did the legwork of organizing the band's schedule. He took out a student loan and used the money to get time at Rainbow Studios in Omaha to record their first independent album Dammit! released under his own record company called ""What Have You Records"". The band released three albums, Dammit!, Unity, and Hydroponic. In 1992, the band felt they'd done all they could on the local scene and moved out to Los Angeles to pursue a record deal. They signed to Capricorn Records.
