"Khujo was born in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He is the only featured guest to appear on every single Outkast album, including Big Boi's solo album. Khujo has released a new book titled ""Straight out the A"" that focuses on his life and the development of the Dirty South movement from OutKast to Goodie Mob. Khujo is a very spiritual man known for his distinct, grunty voice and free-flowing rhyming style. He rhymes about all aspects of street life, often intertwining those subject with God metaphorically or directly. In 2002 he was involved in a car crash that resulted in the amputation of his right leg below the knee. He released his debut solo album, The Man Not the Dawg, in 2002.
