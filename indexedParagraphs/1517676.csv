"Born in St. Louis, Missouri of a Mexican Spanish-Indian father and an African-American mother, he widely was considered the finest pianist in the St. Louis area at the turn of the century. He was part of the ragtime community that met at Tom Turpin's Rosebud bar with Joe Jordan and others.

"Chauvin left only three published compositions and died without having recorded, so his ability is hard to judge today. However, he was long remembered by his peers as an exceptionally gifted performer and composer. He primarily is remembered today for ""Heliotrope Bouquet"", the rag in which he shares compositional credit with Scott Joplin: The nature of the music seems to indicate that Chauvin provided the basis for the first two strains, and Joplin wrote the last two and edited the work into a cohesive piece due to the debilitating effects of Chauvin's illness.His published works are:

"Chauvin died in Chicago at the age of 27. His death certificate lists causes of death as ""multiple sclerosis, probably syphilitic"", and starvation due to coma; but a modern assessment probably would conclude he had neurosyphilitic sclerosis unrelated to multiple sclerosis. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri. He is considered the third member of the 27 Club.
