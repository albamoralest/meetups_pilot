"With Bonham, he released two albums: 1989's The Disregard of Timekeeping (which peaked at Number 38 on the Billboard charts) and 1992's Mad Hatter. In 2001, Daniel was looking to put a new project together, starting with guitarist Stefano Fantin, and a string of small club dates were performed in the Barrie area, though, due to musical differences, they parted ways. In 2005, Daniel released a solo album entitled Rock Bonham...And The Long Road Back which was re-issued by Suncity Records in 2006. Later, MacMaster started a new project with Connecticut-based singer-songwriter Jimmy D of the band Emerald Monkey, dubbed Monkey-MacMaster. The group was planning on releasing music and playing shows; in addition MacMaster had been working on his own material.  However, neither of these projects were completed due to MacMaster's death.
