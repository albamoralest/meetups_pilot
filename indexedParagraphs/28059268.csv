"Of Evil Cowards compared with Electric Six, Spencer stated that:[Evil Cowards] is much more synth-pop in nature, in Electric Six we feature the electronic guitar. The band released their debut album, Covered in Gas, with Metropolis Records in May 2009, shortly before the release of the sixth Electric Six album, KILL.

"A February 2012 news item on The Electric Six website, attributed to Dick Valentine, suggested that 2012 would see the release of the Evil Cowards' second album. The album, entitled Moving Through Security, was released in October that year. Unlike their debut, released by Metropolis Records, the band's second album was self-released without a record label. Also in October 2012, the band released a music video for the song Bedford Avenue Wine Distributors, taken from the new album.
