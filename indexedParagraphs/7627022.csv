"Manafest's genre has developed and changed over his career.  After starting with a classic urban hip hop style for his first four releases, Manafest developed a style of alternative rock and rap rock by lightly mixing it into Citizens Activ, and integrating it by the time of The Chase.  In 2014, with the release of The Moment, Manafest's style changed to a mixture of rap rock and electronic-based hip-hop.

"In 1984, at the age of five, Chris Greenwood lost his father to suicide, leaving only him, his sister Virginia, and his mother. A few years after, at a Bible camp, he accepted Christ and became a Christian. At the same camp, he also met his future wife, Melanie. Around the age of fourteen, Greenwood invested himself into skateboarding and aspired to make it a career. He however experienced an accident in 1998 which crippled his dreams to become a professional skater. After hearing God telling him to turn his attention to music, Greenwood began songwriting and started his career as a Christian artist. In 2003, Greenwood married his wife Melanie Cardoza. They have a daughter. In 2012, Greenwood and his wife moved to Los Angeles, California. In October 2015, he and his family moved back to Toronto, Canada.
