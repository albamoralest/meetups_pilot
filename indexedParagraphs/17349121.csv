"On August 4, 2021, Suzuki went on hiatus due to poor health issues, following a report published on July 30 by Shūkan Bunshun alleging that he was involved in an extramarital affair with a female work associate. The same report also alleged that Suzuki had possibly violated non-disclosure agreements during the affair regarding music he and Oldcodex had been working on for other anime series. On August 30, 2021, Suzuki released a statement apologizing for his ""careless behavior.""As a result of his hiatus, he voluntarily stepped down from his role in Ultraman. He was also recast in Kikai Sentai Zenkaiger, the CD bonuses of the game adaptation of My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, Pokémon Journeys: The Series, Alchemy Stars, The Misfit of Demon King Academy, and Tokyo Revengers.
