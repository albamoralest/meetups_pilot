"Orlando is the son of Professor Edward Higginbottom, formerly conductor of the choir of New College, Oxford. He was educated at the Cherwell School, Oxford. A classically trained musician, he attended the Junior Royal Academy of Music in London. Orlando began listening to electronic music in his early teens, through borrowing audio tapes from his older siblings. Orlando commented to Spin that he was looking for a name that ""couldn't be cool, couldn't be put into some kind of scene that gets hip for six months and then falls out of fashion.""
