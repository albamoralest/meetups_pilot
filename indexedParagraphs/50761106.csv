"Soibelman became a founding member of The Groggers in 2010 when he, guitarist Ari Friedman, and bassist C.J. Glass were recruited by lead singer L.E. Doug Staiman to film a video for the song ""Get"", which Staiman had written. The video became a minor viral hit, and the band subsequently released their debut album, There's No 'I' in Cherem. Soibelman initially concealed his involvement with the band due to their controversial material, to the point of wearing a mask in promotional photos, before ultimately revealing his identity.
