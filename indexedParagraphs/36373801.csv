"Joseph Friedrich Hummel (14 August 1841 in Innsbruck – 29 August 1919 in Salzburg) was an Austrian choral conductor, composer and music teacher. Father of musicologist Walter Hummel, he was a musician and promoter of the works of Wagner, Bruckner and Strauss, a representative of the more creative sounding musical culture of his time. The Josef-Friedrich-Hummel-Straße, a street in Salzburg located in close proximity to the main building of the Mozarteum, was named after him.
