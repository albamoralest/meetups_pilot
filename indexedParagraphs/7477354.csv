"Broad has been mostly playing with ex-Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, since 1987, where he played the drums on Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. album and following tour. In 1990, Broad, who had joined Waters' ""Bleeding Heart Band"", performed onstage during The Wall Concert in Berlin. In 1992, he played on Waters' third solo album, Amused to Death. In 1999, Waters invited him to join him on his In the Flesh tour, which spanned three years from 1999 to 2002. Broad also participated on The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, which began in June 2006 and was extended with additional shows to finish in the spring of 2008. Broad played with Roger Waters again in The Wall Live (2010–2013), touring North America and Europe.
