"After being signed to Dunhill records, Kunkel recorded her first record Billy under the name Cotton Candy. She performed with a few bands and continued growing as a singer and songwriter. In 1972, she sang the counter-melody for ""From Silver Lake"" on Jackson Browne's eponymous debut album. Following additional session work with Stephen Bishop, Carly Simon, and Arlo Guthrie in the early 1970s, Kunkel appeared on JT (1977) by James Taylor. That same year, she appeared on Watermark by Art Garfunkel, who relied on her vocal harmonies for his subsequent albums Fate for Breakfast (1979), Scissors Cut (1981), and Lefty (1988). Garfunkel became a mentor to her, and helped to get her a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1979. In 1979, Kunkel released her first album for Columbia Records, which featured several of her own compositions. The self-titled album produced one single, ""Step Right Up"". The following year she released her second solo album for Columbia, I Run With Trouble.

"In 1980, Kunkel teamed up with Marty Gwinn to form the Coyote Sisters. They released their first album The Coyote Sisters in 1984 on Lorimar Records. A follow-up album, Women and Other Visions, was released in 2001. The Coyote Sisters continue to perform, with Kunkel, who also continues to appear as a solo performer. Following her initial period with the Coyote Sisters, Kunkel qualified as an attorney and has been in private practice for over twenty years.  She is a member of the Bars of California and Massachusetts, with a practice concentration in entertainment law, and lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.
