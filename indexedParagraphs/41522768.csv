"Grigahcine was born in Paris to Algerian parents and grew up in Ermont, a banlieue district outside Paris, which he describes as a ghetto. He cites a scene with Cut Killer in the French film La Haine as well as hip-hop artists KRS-One and Cypress Hill as early influences. In his youth, Grigahcine produced graffiti art, earning him the moniker ""Snake"" because he was able to consistently evade the police. Of his name, Grigahcine says ""When I started DJing, everyone called me 'Snake' in my city first, I was like 'DJ Snake, OK let's go for it.' The name sucks, but it's too late now."" He started DJing at age 14, and later producing at 19. In his early career, Grigahcine performed at clubs including Les Bains Douches in Paris. In 2005, he met his manager Steve Goncalves, who encouraged Grigahcine to begin creating his own music.
