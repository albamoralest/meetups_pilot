"He started taking solfeggio and singing lessons at secondary school but his music career started in high school during a period in which he was chosen as a soloist by the upper levels of the school orchestra. In 1970, Meltemler Orchestra, of which he was a member, won the first place in Marmara Region at the High School Music Contest organized by the Milliyet newspaper. During this period, he received offers from many professional music groups in Istanbul, but he preferred to stay in Bursa until 1972.

"In this period, he produced single plaques and romantic hit pieces, and in 1973 with his own resources he produced his first songBirleşsin Bütün Eller – Bazen Neşe Bazen Keder but could not receive the success he had intended. After record companies refused to give songs written by him to other artists, he produced his second song ""Yazık Oldu Yarınlara – Haydi Sil Gözlerini"" which made him one of the most popular singers in Turkey. His fourth song, which he published in 1976, was removed from the market by the record label as a result of the pressures that they faced which addressed the issue of him questioning the god in the song. In 1976, he released his first LP record İlhan İrem 1973–1976. ""Havalar Nasıl"", ""İşte Hayat"", ""Son Selam"", ""Ayrılık Akşamı"", ""Sen Bilirsin"", and ""Bal Ağızlım"" all became number-one hits on music charts.

"In his own words, İrem decided to stay away from "" the insincere people and meaningless crowds"" and from ""the popular culture that deals more with shapes rather than what people produce"". His search for a music style initiated with the theme of sadness in his songs in the '70s to the theme of peace and metaphysics in '80s. During that period he also wrote a rock symphony. After the publication of ""Bezgin"" which consisted of his compositions in 1981, he released the symphonic rock trilogy, which was the product of a seven-year work in 1983, and was prepared in three separate albums Pencere (1983), Köprü(1985), and Ve Ötesi (1987). The first album in the trilogy Pencere won a Golden Butterfly Award in 1983. In 1984, he represented Turkey at the Golden Orfe Competition in Bulgaria. He also won the Journalists's Special Award. In 1985, the second album from his trilogy Köprü and his first book Pencere... Köprü... Ve Ötesi... were released. In the book, İlhan İrem's musical narrative in Rock Symphony was written and a comprehensive research of Burak Eldem, İzzet Eti and Adnan Özer on İlhan İrem's music were included with the lines of this story. Again in 1986 he wrote the lyrics for the song ""Halley"" which was composed by Melih Kibar for Turkey to be presented at the Eurovision Song Contest and they received the best rating for Turkey up to that time. In 1987, the final album from his trilogy Ve Ötesi and a second book titled Uzaklarda Biri Var were released. They were followed by the albums Dünden Yarına, and Uçun Kuşlar Uçun, which was released in 1989. Ministry of Culture granted permission for taking the song ""Blues For Molla"" out of the album and including it in Uçun Kuşlar Uçun. The invective that he had written following Khomeini's death fatwa for Salman Rushdie was released after 19 years on 29 October 2008 during the Republic's 85th anniversary.
