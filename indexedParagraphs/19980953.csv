"Cove Reber was born in Provo, Utah and grew up a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. During an interview with Shane Told of Silverstein on the Lead Singer Syndrome podcast, Reber cites that he was influenced by the newly ""popping off"" San Diego pop-punk band Blink-182 specifically taking after the band's vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus. Reber started out in early life as vocalist for Vista, California high school bands Mormon In The Middle and Stamp Out Detroit in the early 2000s before auditioning and joining Saosin as lead vocalist in 2004.

"In early 2004 Reber auditioned for and integrated in to the post-hardcore band, Saosin, where he replaced vocalist, Anthony Green. With Saosin, Reber recorded The Grey EP, Saosin EP and notably Saosin (2006) and In Search of Solid Ground (2009) with the inclusion of the live album and DVD Come Close at The Theatre of Living Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on  November 3, 2007.

"Reber was asked to leave Saosin in early 2010. Later reports from the band cited that Reber was asked to leave Saosin due to the deterioration of his stage and vocal performance and he could no longer perform. Reber later addressed his departure by saying the following:
",6,== Musical career == | === Saosin (2004-2010) ===
"""In 2003, I fell in love with a band that not only changed the way that I viewed music, but also inspired me to pursue my dreams. In 2004, the members of that very band that I was madly in love with took a giant risk and gave me, the worlds biggest Saosin fan, a shot. I got to play and make music with my heroes. Even now, Justin, Alex, Beau and Chris are living legends in my mind. It’s not very often that you hear someone say that they had the amazing privilege of working with people they so highly admire and respect.
",7,== Musical career == | === Saosin (2004-2010) ===
"But all bands have their problems and we were no exception. It all started with one comment directed towards me. That seemingly small comment completely drained every ounce of confidence I had worked so hard to build up. Not only did it completely catch me off guard, but not one of my heroes stood up for me, let alone acknowledged that the comment made was truly uncalled for. Thinking you’ve let your heroes down in even the smallest way really freaking sucks.
",8,== Musical career == | === Saosin (2004-2010) ===
"I’m sorry if any of you feel ripped off from my live performances- I take that to heart because every night that I get up on stage, I’m doing it for you guys- for the fans who come to our shows and show us support. As far as smoking goes, it’s not something I intentionally hid but it’s definitely not a habit I wanted to broadcast or promote. Let me make this crystal clear, it’s not a cool thing to do. Anyone who says it is “cool” is flat out lying to you. We all have our demons and this is one I struggle with.
",9,== Musical career == | === Saosin (2004-2010) ===
"For a while now, I had been feeling like it was only a matter of time until my end with Saosin was going to come. I’m just glad I got to sing, write, and record songs with my heroes. For those of you who feel like my role in Saosin was a dominant one, for better or for worse, it wasn’t; every decision we made, we made together. Whether you feel like my departure is positive or negative, I really do wish Justin, Beau, Chris and Alex the best of luck and I will always support them in all that they do.
",10,== Musical career == | === Saosin (2004-2010) ===
"Now that that’s off my chest, life has been treating me awesome these days. The passion and love for music I felt I had lost is back, my confidence is growing daily, and I really can’t wait to show you all what I’ve been working on. Thank you all for giving me the wonderful opportunity to live out my dream over the last 6 years. It was one hell of a ride, but I truly believe that the best is yet to come."".
