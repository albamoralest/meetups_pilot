"With his distinctive, fast-flowing and poetic style, Beans amalgamates witty, thoughtful lyrics with his own productions of ""Chunky psychedelic electro-hop."" According to the Pitchfork Media review for the album Thorns, ""The MC is simply good at what he's good at, putting together bushy, crooked beats with rhymes that are both confessional and evasive.""
