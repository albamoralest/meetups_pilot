",1,== Biography ==
"Hakin was born in Beirut, Lebanon. He was introduced to the organ during his elementary school studies at the Collège du Sacré-Cœur in Beirut. He began with private piano lessons, but when he was nine or ten years old, he began work on his own at the organ using various methods such as Marcel Dupré's 'Méthode d'orgue' and Harold Gleason. In 1975, he moved to Paris to finish his engineering studies at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications since the Ecole Supérieure d’Ingénieurs de Beirut in Lebanon closed because of the Lebanese Civil War.  Hakim privately studied organ and improvisation with Jean Langlais (1907–1991). The relationship with Langlais lasted for about ten years. With Jean Langlais's encouragement, he entered the Conservatoire de Paris where he obtained seven first prizes in organ performance, organ improvisation, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, analysis, and orchestration. He was in the classes of Rolande Falcinelli (organ and improvisation), Roger Boutry (harmony), Jean-Claude Henry (counterpoint), Marcel Bitsch (fugue), Jacques Castérède (analysis) and Serge Nigg (orchestration). He was the organist of the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur, Paris from 1985 until 1993, succeeding Daniel Roth; when he succeeded Olivier Messiaen after the latter's death at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, from 1993 until 2008. He serves as Professor of Musical Analysis at the Conservatoire National de Région de Boulogne-Billancourt, and visiting professor of organ,
