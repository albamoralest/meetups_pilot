In 2002, she married fiddler Donnell Leahy of the Leahy family band, and moved to Lakefield, Ontario.

"MacMaster began playing the fiddle at the age of nine, and made her performing debut the same year at a square dance in Glencoe Mills, Nova Scotia. When she was sixteen she released her first album, Four on the Floor, and a second album, Road to the Isle, followed in 1991. Her first album was self-produced, while her second was co-produced by John Morris Rankin (The Rankin Family) and Tom O'Keefe (as per original cassette jacket). Both albums were initially released only on cassette, but Rounder Records omitted a few tracks and re-released as A Compilation in 1998. In 1999, she performed at the Juno Awards show in Hamilton. In recent years she has expanded her musical repertoire, mixing her Cape Breton roots with music from Scotland and Ireland, as well as American bluegrass. In 2004, MacMaster appeared on Sharon, Lois & Bram's 25th Anniversary Concert special titled ""25 Years of Skinnamarink"" that aired on CBC on January 1, 2004 at 7:00pm. She performed two songs with the trio: ""C-H-I-C-K-E-N"" and ""Grandpa's Farm"".
