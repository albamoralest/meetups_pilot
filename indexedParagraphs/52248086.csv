"In 1905, Avetisyan was accepted to the Nersisian School, where he participated in school plays. Before leaving for the army (in 1916), Avetisyan worked in a manufacturing shop as a student and clerk. After being discharged from the military (in 1918) he joined Hovhannes Abelyan's theater company in Baku. Avetisyan's debut performance occurred in 1918 as Voskan in Alexander Shirvanzade's Evil Spirit (Char Vogi). Then, Avetisyan went to Tbilisi with Abelyan, where he performed in an Armenian drama group (1919). During 1920-1921, Avetisyan performed with the Amo Kharazyan group in Karakilisa (modern Vanadzor). In 1922, Avetisyan moved to Yerevan as part of the touring theatre before being accepted to the famous Sundukyan State Academic Theatre, where he continued to write for the rest of his life. Avetisyan has acted in 28 Armenian movies. Avetisyan is buried in the Komitas Pantheon.
