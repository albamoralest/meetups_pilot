"""Nathalie Béra-Tagrine took the measure of the work (Fantaisie de Schumann) and the mastery from one end to the other, alternating shadow and light, tension and rest with a perfectly controlled sound..."". Claude Pascal - Le Figaro.""Her playing is deeply sensitive, searching for what lies behind the notes and often reveals unexpected charms in a familiar score. A delightful touch, an airy technique, a deep power: Nathalie Béra-Tagrine kept us in suspense."" Pierre Petit – Le Figaro.""There is no mistake, Nathalie Béra-Tagrine is an ideal artist, in the most demanding acceptance of this term! -

"""Nathalie Béra-Tagrine knew not to present the tormented pages of Chopin's 4th ballad only as a skillful virtuoso but to make us suffer the deep truth and recreate them from within. A. Burkhalker – Feuille d’avis de Vevey
",23,== Press excerpts ==
"""The French revelation of Montreux. In 1979, her performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.3 at the Palais des Festivals in Cannes left the audience with an extraordinary impression of technical quality, combined with surprising intelligence, authority and depth. Four years later, it is still with Beethoven that she conquered Montreux. In the 1st concerto this time, she supported its formal density and emotional richness from the first to the last bar. It emanates from her play a kind of ardent and controlled jubilation at the same time.""
