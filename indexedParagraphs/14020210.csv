"Stewart was the second member to join Shinedown after vocalist Brent Smith. They met through a mutual friend of Brent's A&R contact, local Jacksonville producer Pete Thornton. In March 2007, it was reported that Stewart had left Shinedown. No official statement was made, leaving the fans to speculate amongst themselves. On September 20, 2008 on his newly created MySpace, Stewart posted a lengthy blog that provided information about his time with Shinedown and his controversial departure. He told of tensions between band members during the recording of Shinedown's second album, and that ""the reason I was given was that 'I never got over what happened in the studio and during the recording of Us and Them'.""
