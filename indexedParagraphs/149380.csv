"He grew up in Princeton, Texas, living with his parents Charles Edward and Jo-Ann Williams. He grew up in a pious family who caused him to move away from religion. Notably, he also used to wear a T-shirt that read ""Worship Satan and Smoke Crack"". In 1999, he joined Drowning Pool, who had formed in 1996 and had previously performed as an instrumental three-piece. The band released their debut album with Williams, Sinner, in 2001. Williams soon gained recognition for his performances with the band; his nickname ""Stage"" came from Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, who gave it to him because of his known stage personality.

"However, on August 14, 2002, Williams was found dead in the band's tour bus in Manassas, Virginia. An autopsy established that he had died from heart failure caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (heart muscle disease), which went undiagnosed until his death. A public funeral was held in Plano, Texas, on August 18, 2002, at 10:00 am. A DVD titled Sinema which chronicles his life, has since been released. His lifelong dream was to buy his parents a house; the sales from Sinema fulfilled his dream posthumously. Williams's microphone was given to Cristian Machado from Ill Niño. They were good friends, so after his death, Drowning Pool and Williams' family gave it to Machado as a token of respect. The band Memento dedicated their set to Williams on the Ozzfest 2003 stage.
