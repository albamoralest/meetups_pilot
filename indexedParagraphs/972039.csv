"Torpey was born in Painesville, Ohio on December 13, 1953. He first became interested in drumming as a child after seeing a drummer in a polka band performing at a local picnic. In high school, Torpey immersed himself in all available music programs, concert, orchestra, marching and stage bands. About his teenage years, he said: ""I wanted to play everything percussion, and I convinced my mother to buy me a used drum kit for my thirteenth birthday."" His family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he began to hone his skills by playing in various local bands.

"In 1983, Torpey moved to Los Angeles. He recounts the beginning of his career: ""I'm a pretty good softball player and joined an entertainment league, and through that, I was able to make some new friends and network my way into a couple of gigs. I became a regular on the American Bandstand and Solid Gold TV shows performing with Ben E. King, Mike + The Mechanics, Melissa Manchester, Bob Geldof, and a few I can't even remember.""In 1985, Torpey successfully auditioned for the British pop-rock singer John Parr, who at the time had a #1 hit song ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and had attained the opening slot for Tina Turner on her Private Dancer tour. When that tour ended he became the drummer for Belinda Carlisle on her first solo tour, opening for Robert Palmer.

"Torpey further explains: ""In 1987, I was doing a television show with Roger Daltrey and Bobby Colomby from Blood, Sweat and Tears approached me and asked me if I was available to do some studio work. Colomby was producing a couple of tracks for The Knack, and their original drummer had just left the band. I loved their music and what great fun for a drummer. They asked me to join the band.""

"Torpey has been noted as an accomplished backing vocalist (with an extensive vocal range) and he often sings cover songs in the Mr. Big show during his encore. Also, he sings songs from The Beatles during his drum solo.

Several tracks from these albums were reworked from Cordola and Wright's previous band Chaos Is the Poetry.
