"Having studied music in his native Naples, Fasano established in 1941 the chamber orchestra Collegium Musicum Italicum later renamed I Virtuosi di Roma. This small orchestra helped popularize Italian Baroque music. He conducted widely in Europe works by such composers as Corelli, Vivaldi, Pergolesi, Baldassarre Galuppi, Alessandro Marcello and Giovanni Paisiello. In addition, he founded the ""Piccolo Teatro Musicale Italiano"" in 1957.
