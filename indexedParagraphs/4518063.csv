"In 1960, Maharis appeared as Buz Murdock in the TV series Route 66, which co-starred Martin Milner.  Maharis was 32 at the time the series started, although the character he was playing was only 23. He received an Emmy nomination in 1962 for his continuing performance as Buz.

"Maharis departed without completing his third season of the series, which saw him with health problems, including hepatitis. Maharis said he left Route 66 for health reasons, due to long hours and grueling conditions while shooting on location. ""I have to protect my future"", Maharis said in a 1963 interview. ""If I keep going at the present pace, I'm a fool. Even if you have $4,000,000 in the bank, you can't buy another liver.""Series producers Stirling Silliphant and Herbert B. Leonard disputed Maharis' stated position, arguing that he desired to break his contract in order to make movies. After Maharis' departure, the show's appeal declined. Glenn Corbett acted in the role of Milner's new sidekick, Linc Case. A year later Route 66 was canceled.
