"Tracy Howe was born in Toronto, Ontario. His father, John Howe,  was a film producer and his mother, Mary Sheppard,  was a stage actress. In 1952 Tracy and his family moved to London, England. In 1956, when Tracy was 4 they moved to Ottawa, Canada. In 1957 the family moved to Ville St-Laurent, Quebec and in 1959 moved again to Pointe-Claire, Quebec where Tracy lived until he left home in 1970 at age 18. Tracy has been playing music in bands since he was 15. Howe's professional music career began in 1975 as a singer and drummer for Montreal punk band The Normals. Howe was later a drummer and singer in Montreal band Heaven Seventeen (not to be confused with England's Heaven 17), considered to be one of the first punk bands to use synthesizers. One of Heaven Seventeen's keyboard players was Ivan Doroschuk, who later formed Men Without Hats. Howe also later joined Men Without Hats, as a guitarist, prior to forming Rational Youth with Bill Vorn.
