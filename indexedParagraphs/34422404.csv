"""Fornarelli is a skilful instrumentalist with classical roots and a subtle improviser's mind"". Alison Gunn of the Financial Times writes ""A near-perfect balance of tension and freedom. Fornarelli's music has a pared-down yet catchy style that draws on his classical roots, with influences from pop to trip-hop to gospel""Paolo Fresu writes: ""As long as there are musicians as open minded as Kekko Fornarelli, jazz will carry on being the World's music. Kekko’s intimacy is made of rich melodies and chord progressions which evoke some delicate forms of modern jazz, but are translated by that particular touch which makes him one of the most interesting young pianist of the moment.""
