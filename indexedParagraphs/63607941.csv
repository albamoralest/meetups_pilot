"Masahiro Naoe (then known as Masataro Naoe) formed the band Jibiinkōka (耳鼻咽喉科, lit. ""Otolaryngology"") in 1981. In December 1983, the band was renamed ""Carnation"" and released their first independent single ""Yoru no Entotsu"" a year later. The band released their first full album Young Wise Men in 1988. Within the same year, the band left the independent scene and signed with Tokuma Japan. The band participated in the production of J-pop idol Chisato Moritaka's 1989 album Hijitsuryokuha Sengen, which features her cover of ""Yoru no Entotsu"". In addition, Moritaka provided guest vocals on the band's 1991 album Elec. King. Naoe continued to contribute to Moritaka's other releases throughout the first half of the 1990s. The band signed with Nippon Columbia in 1994, with their album Edo River becoming popular with FM stations. They hosted a successful concert at Shibuya Public Hall in 1997. The band switched to Cutting Edge Records in 2003, but left two years later when Naoe formed his own label Hurricane Records. In 2013, the tribute album Nande Kimi wa Boku yori Boku no Koto Kuwashii no? (なんできみはぼくよりぼくのことくわしいの?, lit. What's More About Me Than Me?) was released to celebrate Carnation's 30th anniversary. The album features contributions by Moritaka, Yasuyuki Okamura, and others. Three years later, Carnation signed with Nippon Crown. The band celebrated its 35th anniversary with their ""Sunset Monsters"" concert at the Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall.
