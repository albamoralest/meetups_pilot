"William Henry Marcus Miller Jr. (born June 14, 1959) is an American multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, composer, producer and singer, best known as a bassist. He has worked with trumpeter Miles Davis, pianist Herbie Hancock, singer Luther Vandross, and saxophonist David Sanborn, among others. His collaboration with Vandross was especially close: Miller co-produced and served as the arranger for most of Vandross's albums, and co-wrote (with Vandross) many of his songs, including the hits ""I Really Didn't Mean It"", ""Any Love"", ""Power of Love/Love Power"" and ""Don't Want to Be a Fool"". He also co-wrote the 1988 single ""Da Butt"" for Experience Unlimited. Miller was the main songwriter and producer on three of Miles Davis's albums: Tutu (1986), Music from Siesta (1987), and Amandla (1989).

"Miller is noted for playing a 1977 Fender Jazz Bass that was modified by Roger Sadowsky with the addition of a Bartolini preamp so he could control his sound in the studio.
