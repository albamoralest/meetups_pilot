"Fabio Golfetti was born in São Paulo in 1960. He grew up listening to Pink Floyd, Gong, Led Zeppelin, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones (with their 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request being one of his favorite releases by them), and as a teenager he learned how to play both the classical and the electric guitar, quoting Daevid Allen, Syd Barrett, Terje Rypdal and Manuel Göttsching as some of his major influences. In 1978 he founded Lux, his first band. Lux later became Ultimato in 1981, an instrumental punk jazz/no wave band with the arrival of drummer Cláudio Souza, and later came to be named Zero in 1983, with the entrance of vocalist Guilherme Isnard (Voluntários da Pátria). With Zero, he took part in the recording of the single ""Heróis"". In 1985, Golfetti and Souza left Zero and formed alongside Angelo Pastorello the influential psychedelic rock band Violeta de Outono. As of 2016 Violeta de Outono has released 7 studio albums, 2 EPs, 4 videos and 2 live albums.
