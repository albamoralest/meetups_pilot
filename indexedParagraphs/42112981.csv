"At the beginning of the 1990s, Bélis created the Ensemble Kérylos to recreate music as it was during classical antiquity as faithfully as possible. There were three components to this process. First, deciphering musical papyri from antiquity, which she did as part of her scientific work as a papyrologist. Second, reconstructing the ancient instruments needed to play the music, what she did based on archaeological evidence and with the help of French and Spanish luthiers J.-C. Condi and C. Gonzalez. Finally, performing the scores, the reason why she founded the Ensemble Kérylos. In 1996, under her direction, the Ensemble Kérylos recorded a CD: De la pierre au son: Musiques de l'Antiquité grecque et romaine. In 2016, still under the direction of Annie Bélis, the Ensemble Kérylos produced a new recording, D'Euripide aux premiers chrétiens, a new interpretation of the scores of the previous CD taking into account progress in academic research in the field. This CD has the first recording of the ""Roman Kithara"" reconstructed by Annie Bélis and Carlos Gonzalez and the ""Paean to Apollo"" written by Mesomedes of Crete in its corrected edition.
