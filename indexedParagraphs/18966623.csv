He began his musical career in 1934, when he joined the Freddy Platt band at the Carlton Ballroom, Rochdale along with Geoff Love; Sharples played piano, and Love played trombone. In 1963, Sharples conducted the London Festival Orchestra, augmented with military band, in a London Records' Phase 4 Stereo recording of Tschaikovsky's 1812 Overture, backed with the same composer's Nutcracker Suite, showing his skill as a ""light classics"" conductor.

Sharples' other TV credits include themes for The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes, the early 1970s Thames series Man At The Top and the 1975 BBC documentary series The Explorers, as well as incidental music to Follyfoot.
