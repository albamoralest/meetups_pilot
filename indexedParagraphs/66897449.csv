"According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Taylor ""established that not only is it possible to identify individual birds by their calls but that those calls evolve over time."" She has argued that birdsong is music; traditional musicology excludes anything not created by humans. Taylor argues that the song of the pied butcherbird, in addition to being a form of communication, has an aesthetic character, with technique and inventiveness similar to human compositions, and that along with behavioral evidence supports the conclusion that birds have an aesthetic sensibility which may be analogous to that of humans. In 2019, Taylor was appointed an Australia Research Council Future Fellow at Macquarie University.
