"In the late 1970s Meier was brought in when the two founders of the Swiss electronic band Yello realised that they required a singer. The band was originally formed by Boris Blank (keyboards, sampling, percussion, backing vocals) and Carlos Perón (tapes) in the late 1970s. Perón left the band in 1983 to pursue a solo career, ultimately leaving Blank and Meier to record their most well known and commercially successful single ""Oh Yeah"" in which Meier provided almost all vocals, backing vocals and lyrics. ""Oh Yeah"" went on to appear in numerous films and television series in the following decades including Ferris Bueller's Day Off, director Jonathan Demme's Something Wild with Jeff Daniels and Melanie Griffith,  and the episode of South Park ""Hell on Earth 2006"".

"As a conceptual artist, he has been keeping himself busy with many art exhibitions. He began his career as a performance artist in the late 1960s. In 1972 as part of Documenta 5, Meier installed a commemorative plaque at the railway station in Kassel (Germany) which read: ""On 23 March 1994, from 3 to 4 pm, Dieter Meier will stand on this plaque"". He honored the promise 22 years later.Meier directed numerous films and videos, including German music group Alphaville's ""Big in Japan"" video.In the 1990s music took a backseat as Meier continued his performance art, designed silk scarves and was involved with ReWATCH, a company that recycles cans into watches. However, two more Yello albums did surface. In the late nineties, he bought 2200 hectares of land in Argentina, a four-hour drive away from Buenos Aires. The ranch is named ""Ojo de Agua"". His restaurant and store in Zurich has the same name from which he sells wine, meat, corn and soy products.
