"Vidaurri played in the bands the Ashes, along with Alec and Thomas Hanslowe. Their music is described as bringing together ""tubas and violins, banjos and electric guitars, organs and jawharps, all while dabbling in the sounds of the 60's, Nashville and New Orleans,"" and it draws comparison to the music of the Brian Jonestown Massacre, Bright Eyes, Tom Petty, and Tom Waits. They released the albums Photoplay Music in 2010, and Sing! in 2011, with Mint 400 Records. They also played with the Old Glorys, a group consisting of the Ashes, and former Any Day Parade vocalist Melissa Jackson. They released the EP Brunswick Street Demos.

"Vidaurri signed with Mint 400 Records, in 2014, as a solo artist. For the tribute album, Transformed: A Tribute to Lou Reed, Vidaurri does a rendition of the song ""I'm Set Free.""

He released the album The Cat Man is Sad in 2015, and performed at the 2016 North Jersey Indie Rock Festival. He also released the albums The Cat Man Returns in 2017, and The Cat Man Is On His Own Again in 2018.
