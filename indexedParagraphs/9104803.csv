"After getting some experience with local gigs in San Francisco, promoter Bill Graham booked Night Ranger as the opening act for such bands as Judas Priest, Santana, and the Doobie Brothers. They became one of the most popular mainstream hard rock bands of the mid-1980s. Night Ranger's first album, Dawn Patrol, released in 1982, reached No. 38 on the U.S. charts and sold over 1 million copies, yet it was 1983's Midnight Madness that established the band as a commercial force. Featuring the hits ""(You Can Still) Rock in America"" and ""Sister Christian"", the record peaked at No. 15 and sold over 2 million copies. The 1985 album 7 Wishes was even more successful, reaching No. 10 on the charts and selling over 3 million copies.
