"Hibbert had a starring role as Faulconbridge in the BBC's production of The Life and Death of King John, published in 1984. He has appeared on Broadway and in major regional theatre productions, worked in television as a series regular and guest star and also had roles in major films. In 1993 he won an Obie Award for his co-starring role of ""Sterling"" in Paul Rudnick's Jeffrey. His ""Frederick Fellows/Philip Brent"" in the National Theatre revival of Noises Off (presented at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre) was called ""delightfully discombobulated"" by one reviewer. Hibbert was in the Broadway musicals The Drowsy Chaperone and the 2007 premiere of Curtains (which reunited him with his Frasier co-star David Hyde Pierce). He appeared on Broadway as ""Mr. Praed"" (the architect) in Roundabout Theatre's 2010 production of Mrs. Warren's Profession starring Cherry Jones. He appeared on Broadway in the new musical It Shoulda Been You in 2015, again working with David Hyde Pierce, this time with Pierce as the director.

"Hibbert is openly gay. He says he's never come out of the closet, but never had to. ""I think in England it's not the same. It's unspoken but understood.""Being an out actor has never been a problem, Hibbert says. ""Being gay for me in Hollywood was not a problem. Someone once said, 'An Englishman and a homosexual is a distinction without a difference.' Everyone thinks all Englishmen are gay...""
