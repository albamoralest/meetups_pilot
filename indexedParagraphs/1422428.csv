"Roland On/Off switchTielli painted his Ibanez guitar with a ""never quite presented idea"" for the new Canadian flag, designed by A.Y. Jackson. This design is often mistaken for one originally championed by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson to be the Canadian flag (nicknamed ""the Pearson Pennant""). This guitar appears on the cover for the Rheostatics album, Double Live. Tielli's Steinberger guitar is nicknamed ""Steiny"".
