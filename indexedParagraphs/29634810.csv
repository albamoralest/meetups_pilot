They formed Revolver in 1990, with Flint acting as vocalist and guitarist and also playing organ. After two albums and several singles, they split up in early 1994. The previous year, Flint had joined Paula Kelley of Drop Nineteens' band Hot Rod, in which he played bass and provided backing vocals. The band also featured John Dragonetti and Eric Paull. They released a single album in 1993, Speed Danger Death. Flint then joined Death in Vegas as bassist, and played on all of their albums, as well as performing at every live show from 1996 to 2005.
