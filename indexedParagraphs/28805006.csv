"Borràs began her musical studies at age eight at the Liceo Conservatory in Barcelona, where she studied piano, harmony and guitar. Teachers she studied with included Molinari, Agosti and Vito Frazzi. Later she studied harmony, counterpoint and composition with Cristòfor Taltabul. In 1950 she received a scholarship to study at the Accademia Chigiana of Siena (Italy), and received the scholarship again two years later. At this Academy, she received a grant to study master classes in composition and later studied two courses of Frazzi harpsichord in the Conservatory of Barcelona. In Siena she learned to play unusual instruments like the harpsichord and the harp, which added to her knowledge of piano and guitar. In 1979 she was awarded the Summer School Fellowship for Composition  ""Music in Compostela"" in the class of Rodolfo Halffter. In 1997 she was awarded the ""Caterina Albert i Paradis"" prize. Between 1947 and 1953, she was a concert pianist. For seven years she was professor of piano and guitar at the Municipal Music School of Manresa, was also a professor of piano and harmony at the Music School of Mataró (subsidiary of the Lyceum) and later a professor at the Institute Alexandre Satorras.
