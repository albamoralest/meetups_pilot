"Lee's conducting career, which began in 1987, developed rapidly with invitations to collaborate with numerous orchestras. In 1992, Yoon Kuk Lee was offered the challenge of creating a new chamber orchestra on the European music scene, which was christened the Salzburger Kammerphilharmonie. Engaging fine professional musicians around him as their musical director, Lee went on to develop highly innovative concert series in Salzburg and beyond.

"One of many note-worthy collaborations was Lee's ambitious project with pianist Cyprien Katsaris between 1996 and 1999 to perform and record the complete works by Mozart for piano and orchestra, all of the concertos but other, lesser known compositions. The resulting 15 CD production for the Piano 21 label was the first of its kind in recording history. Lee's release of the Sinfonias by C.P.E. Bach (Naxos) in 1995 brought him lasting global recognition. The album was chosen as one of the 10 finest CDs by Gramophone magazine and the WQXR FM in New York.
