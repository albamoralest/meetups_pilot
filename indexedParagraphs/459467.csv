"Told by his art teachers that he would never make it as an artist due to his crude style, he quit art and became a full-time magician. After a few years, his passion for art overtook him and he created the comic Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl for Xenophobe magazine. The comic strips were later seen by Dan Vado, president of Slave Labor Graphics.

One of Dirge's legs was severely injured and had to be rebuilt with a metal rod, but he was said to be in good spirits despite facing a long recovery.  Roman is still not fully recovered.
