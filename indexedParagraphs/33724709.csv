"Cornor was born and raised in Deer Park, Texas, a suburb of Houston. He began playing guitar professionally at the age of 13, first for Gene Watson, then later for Frenchie Burke. During his tour years with Watson, he mastered the pedal steel, banjo, fiddle and harmonica. He next worked as a session musician, and soon got a recording contract of his own. His first ABC/Dot single, ""Sometimes I Talk in My Sleep"" from My First Album, reached Number 9 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Two other singles from the album, Heart Don't Fail Me Now and Love Doesn't Live Here Anymore, also charted. Both ""Sometimes I Talk in My Sleep"" and ""I Guess You Never Loved Me Anyway"" were written by Eddy Raven.
