"A big draw card on the live music scene, he was also a major recording star in New Zealand during the 1950s. During the 1950s when the transition from 78 rpm records to 33 rpm records was taking place, Bill Wolfgramm & His Islanders recorded South Sea Rhythm at Auckland's Astor Recording Studios. This album took four months to record and it featured Daphne Walker. It has the distinction of being one of the first long playing 33rpm records to be pressed in New Zealand. There is a belief by some that this album may have been the first.
