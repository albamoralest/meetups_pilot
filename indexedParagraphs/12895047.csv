"When Turbin was first contacted by Anthrax he was already in a band called AMRA, but left after a few months, which prompted him to answer Anthrax's advertisement. He attended the same high school as Scott Ian and Danny Lilker, Bayside High School in New York City, and was in a class with Ian in his freshman year. Turbin earned the position as the first official band vocalist in August 1982. His first performance with Anthrax was at Great Gildersleeves on September 12, 1982. He performed and recorded with the band on the original demo recordings and their first studio album, Fistful of Metal. Turbin wrote the lyrics to all songs on that album (with exception of the cover of Alice Cooper's ""I'm Eighteen""). He also has writing credits on five of the seven songs on the band's Armed and Dangerous EP, as well as two songs on Spreading the Disease, both of which were recorded by third Anthrax vocalist Joey Belladonna, who replaced second Anthrax vocalist Matt Fallon. Turbin's exit from Anthrax came two weeks after the band's first North American tour, ""Anthrax US Attack Tour 1984"", ending with a show at Roseland Ballroom on August 3. In 2009, the video game Brütal Legend was released, featuring the Anthrax song ""Metal Thrashing Mad"" on its soundtrack, with Turbin's vocals. Many of the songs Turbin wrote and recorded with the band have been re-recorded with different vocalists and appear on multiple albums and DVDs, including the double-platinum certified The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria.
