"Graham began her career during the 1960s as a band singer with the Cyclones in Scotland and later with the Cyril Stapleton Band, based in London England. She joined The Track in the mid-sixties and was a founding member of The Nocturnes, originally alongside Sandra Stevens (later of Brotherhood of Man) and then Lyn Paul (her future colleague in The New Seekers), recording for UK Columbia Records between 1967 and 1969. In 1969 she joined songwriter Roger Cooke for a single release, again on Columbia, called ""Smiling Through My Tears"" shortly before becoming a founder member of The New Seekers in 1969 and was lead singer on the majority of their early hits, including the world wide Number One hit – ""I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing"". Other songs that featured Graham as lead vocalist included the US and Canadian smash ""Look What They've Done to My Song Ma"", the British Top 5 hit ""Circles"", the Japanese No.1 ""The Greatest Song I've Ever Heard"" and the Roger Cook-Roger Greenaway composition ""We've Got To Do It Now"". Graham's three-octave range was showcased on several songs, most notably the British and European hit ""Never Ending Song of Love"", in which she reached No. 6.  Though mainly a vocalist, she played acoustic guitar on stage in the Chuck Berry-influenced skiffle number ""Good Old-Fashioned Music"" and kazoo in the comic song ""(Ever Since You Told Me That You Loved Me) I'm A Nut"".

"In 1974, the group disbanded and Graham moved onto solo cabaret work, but rejoined a reconstituted New Seekers in 1976, and sang lead on their hits ""It's So Nice To Have You Home"" and ""I Wanna Go Back"". In 1978 she left once more, and again performed as a solo singer, as well as marrying another ex-New Seeker Kevin Finn (known professionally as Danny Finn) on 1 June 1979. They toured as a duo for many years and released one single ""Ocean and Blue Sky"". Graham retired in 2000 after a last charity performance, and originally said that she could not envisage being tempted out of retirement. However, in 2005, former New Seekers record producer David Mackay produced a new album with her The Mountains Welcome Me Home. It was released as a CD and DVD, and contained Scottish traditional songs and new recordings of New Seekers songs. A Christmas themed album, Til The Season Comes Round Again, followed in 2006. In 2008, she told The Independent newspaper that after the band broke up she found work fitting bras, in a branch of Debenhams department store in Essex. She lived in Abernethy, Perthshire with her husband, who worked for a kitchen and bathroom design company. He died on 22 February 2016 after a short illness.
