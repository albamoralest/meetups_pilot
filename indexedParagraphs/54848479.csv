"Klein and Jimmy Gaudreau met in 1990 at a picking party. In 1992, they formed Chesapeake with Seldom Scene members Mike Auldridge (resonator guitar) and T. Michael Coleman (bass). At first a side project, the band eventually became a full-time occupation, and they recorded three albums for Sugar Hill. With no banjo, they were more acoustic country than bluegrass. Chesapeake disbanded in 1999 when their contract with Sugar Hill ended.
