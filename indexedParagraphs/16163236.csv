"McCaslin was born in Santa Clara, California, on August 11, 1966. His father was a vibraphonist, and McCaslin played in his father's ensemble at the age of twelve. He had his own group in high school, which played three years at the Monterey Jazz Festival.

"In 1987, after studying at Berklee College of Music, McCaslin joined Gary Burton's group and toured the world with him for four years. In 1991 he moved to New York City and was a member of Steps Ahead. In November 2014, McCaslin played saxophone on David Bowie's single ""Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)"". Subsequently he would play saxophone on Bowie's 2016 album Blackstar. On October 14, 2016, McCaslin released Beyond Now, inspired by his experience recording Blackstar. The album features the same band that appeared on Blackstar - Tim Lefebvre on bass, Jason Lindner on keyboards, and Mark Guiliana on drums. The album includes two Bowie covers, as well as covers of MUTEMATH, Deadmau5, and The Chainsmokers, plus five original tracks. NPR's All Songs Considered called McCaslin's ""What About the Body"" single ""exhilarating art-rock"". The album it came from, Blow, was awarded New Jazz Album of the Year by JazzJapan.
