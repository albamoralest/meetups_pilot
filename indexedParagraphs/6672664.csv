"He had released eight albums with notable hits  before his death in Istanbul from COVID-19, while in the hospital being treated for liver problems brought on by alcoholism. Shahram had a long battle with alcoholism and was sober for several months during his stay in Istanbul, but unfortunately relapsed months prior to his death. Legendary Iranian singer, Dariush Eghbali tried to help him with his alcoholism. Shahrum's interest for singing and music manifested at an early age. He started his career in 1990; however, it was not until 1992 that he released his professional debut album titled K-One, promoted byAlireza Amirghassemi,and also with support of Persian super star Leila Forouhar. Due to his youth, synergy, and style, he gained popularity in a short amount of time International popularity came with his second album Atash with hits like Begou Tou Begou and Khater Khah. In 2001 he stopped working with Caltex Records and instead signed on with Taraneh Records. This collaboration yielded couple instant bestsellers. The hit songs Dokhtar Bandari, Yadam Nemirehand Dige Basteh became club favorites. In a 2005 interview with Tapesh, Shahrum talked about his childhood, about his parent's divorce and his mom's short marriage to Googoosh's first husband. Shahrum also, in this interview, blamed Taraneh Records for not promoting his new album Khoshalam enough and delaying its release. His claim was dismissed by the owner of Taraneh, Vartan Avenassian, who cited immaturity of the singer as cause of their tense relationship. In August 2006 Shahrum's new music video from his latest album Game Over(directed by élan productions), was aired on all Persian satellite channels. Despite his complications with the record company, this album was still released by Taraneh Records. His latest music, Sahneh Sazi, was performed at Valley Oaks Memorial Park at his funeral, and artists such as Andranik Madadian and Shahbal Shabpareh attended his funeral and spoke about Shahram. Ali Hosseinzadeh, composer and songwriter of Shahram Kashani's latest song, explained about this song in an interview with KIRN Los Angeles Radio. The idea of making this song was formed many years ago, considering the events that took place in Shahram's personal life, I wrote this song. Shahram called this song an elevator because I refer to life somewhere in the poem, which is like an elevator زندگی ی آسانسوره یکیو بالا میبره اون که پایینه دلخورهLife is an elevator Raises one He who is down is sad. Shahram went to his studio in Los Angeles twice to record this song and recorded it several times. Because he was telling me I think my feelings are not real
