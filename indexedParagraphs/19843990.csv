On the Radio City album, he wrote ""Way Out West"" and co-wrote on ""Life Is White"", ""What's Going Ahn"", ""Back of a Car"", and ""Daisy Glaze"".

Hummel again returned to school and earned an associate degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology from State Technical Institute at Memphis in 1978.
