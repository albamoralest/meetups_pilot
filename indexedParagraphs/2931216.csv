"Clervoix who is of Haitian descent, joined in on the relief efforts a year later in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake that still left many people impoverished and homeless sending over money, food and clothes to Port-au-Prince, as well as his mother’s hometown of Limbé. He sought to create a Haitian hip-hop EP in collaboration with Creole Haitian rap stars such as Seca Konsa and among others. He is cousins with DJ Whoo Kid.
