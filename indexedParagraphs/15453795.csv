"Halliday made his debut album, Delayed Exposure, with the Chicago jazz label Delmark Records in 1991. His following albums, East of the Sun (1991) and Where or When (1993) with saxophonist Ira Sullivan were well received by the Chicago jazz community. Halliday became a ""staple attraction""  at many Chicago jazz clubs including the Green Mill, the Bop Shop, Joe Segal's Jazz Showcase, and the Get Me High Lounge. His performance on trumpeter Brad Goode's album Shock of the New (1998) won him much admiration on the Chicago jazz scene. Halliday was also featured on the album Stablemates (1995) with Chicago saxophonist Eric Alexander.
