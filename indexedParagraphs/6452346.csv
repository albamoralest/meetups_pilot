"A chance meeting with the influential guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bassist Jack Bruce in 1979, (while Husband was fulfilling his last engagement with saxophonist Barbara Thompson at Ronnie Scott's Club) resulted in a casual jam session.

"Gary Husband's proficiency on both drums and keyboards has received praise from other musicians and critics. In 2017, Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree referred to him as ""a great, amazingly talented musician! ... He's off the charts talented, this guy. I don't know anyone else in the world who can play piano at that level, and drums at that level"". Music critic John Fordham of The Guardian considers him one of the best British musicians in the contemporary post-bop scene, describing Husband's pianistic style as ""an onrush of long-lined phrases and ambiguous harmonies boldly adapted from Herbie Hancock and Bill Evans.""In 2011, when asked to recommend modern drummers to a drumming magazine, Bill Bruford of King Crimson mentioned Gary Husband, stating that ""anything Gary plays on is great"" and concluding that he is among the ""players [who] are helping push the boundaries of how things should be."" Pat Mastelotto said that Husband is an ""inspiration to every drummer."" Other drummers who have cited him as an influence or expressed admiration for his drumming work are Tomas Haake of Meshuggah. Sean Reinert of Cynic, Peter Wildoer of Darkane, and Rick Colaluca of Watchtower.
