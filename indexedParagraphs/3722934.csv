"Whitfield was born in Hull in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He sang in the choir at his church during his childhood and entertained his fellow members of the Royal Navy during the Second World War. After the war, he appeared on Opportunity Knocks, a talent show on Radio Luxembourg. His first recording to reach the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart was ""Bridge of Sighs"", written by Billy Reid. ""Answer Me"" (later recorded with different lyrics as ""Answer Me, My Love"") reached number one in the UK. Both versions have appeared on CD.

"Whitfield had other hits in the 1950s, and was the most successful British male singer in America during that period. In addition, he was the first British male vocalist to earn a gold disc and the third overall. He was also the first to reach the Top Ten of the Billboard Top 100, and the first artist from Britain to sell over a million copies of a record in the US. All of his hits were released by the Decca record label in the UK. His only album to reach the UK Albums Chart was The World of David Whitfield, which reached Number 19. He used orchestras, including those of Stanley Black, fellow Decca artist Mantovani and Roland Shaw, as backing accompaniment for said hits.

He continued to perform regularly across the globe, while living in Hull in the UK.

"Many of his singles were issued on LP and have been reissued in recent years on CD compilations under licence. There were three 45rpm EP specials (1959–60), one entitled ""The Good Old Songs"" and the other two featuring numbers from ""Rose Marie"" and ""The Desert Song,"" two musical shows in which Whitfield toured. On leaving Decca he recorded two singles for HMV (1962–63). His last LP, made for Philips in 1975 and entitled Hey There! It's David Whitfield, included his third recording of ""Cara Mia"" (he had already recorded a stereo re-make for Decca in 1966 for an album entitled Great Songs for Young Lovers). Whitfield's last single was for Denman, a coupling of ""Land of Hope and Glory"" and ""When You Lose the One You Love"" (1977).
