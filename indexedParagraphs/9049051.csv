"He began to play the clarinet at the age of 11 but had taken up the saxophone by the time he left school and then turned professional. In 1949 he performed at the Paris Jazz Festival and with Charlie Parker when Parker was on tour in Sweden in 1950. A few years later he recorded with Clifford Brown, Art Farmer, and James Moody. From the middle 1950s to the middle 1960s he was a featured soloist in the Swedish Radio Big Band. He wrote for film and television and recorded with Lars Gullin and Bengt Hallberg. With Bengt-Arne Wallin, Rolf Ericson, and Åke Persson (the latter two were former members of Duke Ellington's Orchestra), he participated in the Jazz Workshops organised for the Ruhrfest in Recklinghausen by Hans Gertberg from the Hamburg radio station. He recorded several times with Quincy Jones in Sweden and is featured throughout ""The Midnight Sun Never Sets"", composed and arranged by Jones and recorded under Jones' direction by Harry Arnold's orchestra in 1958. Domnérus' playing in his early career was typical of the cool, sophisticated, technically accomplished and lyrical style of Swedish modern jazz during the 1950s. Domnérus' health declined in his last years, and he retired from playing.
