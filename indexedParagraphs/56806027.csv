"Donnelly is a supporter of various social and political causes. Her 2017 debut single ""Boys Will be Boys"", written about societal attitudes towards women and her friend's experience of sexual assault, was dubbed a ""#MeToo anthem"" (despite being written and released prior to the widespread global coverage of the movement).

"Donnelly is opposed to the celebration of Australia Day. In a 2019 interview with The Guardian, she stated: ""It's a really nationalist, white pride day... and it's actually a very historic day for Indigenous Australians â€“ an invasion day, and a day of mourning."" Donnelly supports same-sex marriage, and was ""relieved"" when it was legalised in Australia in 2017. Donnelly is pro-choice.
