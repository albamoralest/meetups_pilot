"The Collins Kids were an American rockabilly duo featuring Lawrencine ""Lorrie"" Collins (May 7, 1942 â€“ August 4, 2018) and her younger brother Lawrence ""Larry"" Collins (born October 4, 1944). Their hits in the 1950s as youngsters, such as ""Hop, Skip and Jump"", ""Beetle Bug Bop"" and ""Hoy Hoy"", were geared towards children, but their infectious singing and playing crossed over generations. Larry, a lightning-fingered guitar whiz at age 10, was known for playing a double-neck Mosrite guitar like his mentor, Joe Maphis.

"The Collins Kids became regular performers on Town Hall Party in 1954 and on the syndicated for television version of the show, Tex Ritter's Ranch Party, which ran from 1957 to 1959. It was on Town Hall Party that Ricky Nelson first saw Lorrie Collins, and soon after they began dating. In a 1958 episode of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, Lorrie played both Ricky's girlfriend - and that girlfriend's sister.
