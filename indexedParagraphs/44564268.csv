"Cooking Vinyl was founded in 1986 by Goldschmidt and his former business partner Pete Lawrence, initially operating out of Goldschmidt's council house in Stockwell, South London. Over 25 years on the label has diversified from its original folk roots into releasing rock, metal, indie, punk and electronica. Cooking Vinyl is also recognised as a pioneer of ‘artist services’ deals working with artists such as Billy Bragg, The Prodigy and Marilyn Manson.
