"Jordan, an only child, was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland to a Christian Ethiopian father and Puerto Rican mother, occasionally attending a Baptist church. As a youth, Jordan was a fan of the conscientious rhymes of KRS-ONE and Public Enemy's Chuck D. Jordan first became interested in Judaism at the age of seven. ""I saw a commercial that said, 'Happy Passover from your friends at Channel 2,'"" he said, ""and I went drawing six-pointed stars on everything at my mother's house."" He started wearing a kippah and observing Shabbat at 14, and converted to Judaism around the turn of millennium. He later spent time studying at a yeshiva in Jerusalem. In May 2012, Jordan came out as gay. As of 2012, he still identified as an Orthodox Jew. However, by 2019 he proclaimed himself off the derech and reported that he was eating non-kosher seafood.
