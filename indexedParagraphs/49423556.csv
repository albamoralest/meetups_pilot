"Wexler grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and started playing at age five. He is a cousin of singer-songwriter Peter Himmelman. In 1975, Wexler became one of the founding members of the Diaspora Yeshiva Band, along with Avraham Rosenblum, Ben Zion Solomon, Simcha Abramson, Ruby Harris, and Gedalia Goldstein. The group, which played rock and bluegrass with Jewish lyrics, was highly influential in Jewish music and released six albums before disbanding in 1983.
",2,== Biography ==
"Wexler was an associate of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, performing on several albums in the 1980s and early 1990s. Shortly after Carlebach's death in 1994, Wexler and fellow Carlebach devotee Yehuda Katz co-formed the band Reva L'Sheva. Combining a Carlebach influence with a jam band rock sound, the band was a forebearer of the post-Carlebach Jewish rock scene, preceding bands like Moshav, Soulfarm, and Blue Fringe. The band released six studio albums before disbanding in 2004. In 2005, Wexler released his debut solo album, A Million Voices.
