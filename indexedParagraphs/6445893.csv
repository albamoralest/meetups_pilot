"In 2006 she released the album Lure the Fox, originally on Mary Ellen Recordings, whose owner, Mary Lewis, decided to help her pay to record the album at Pachyderm Studio after reading a Star Tribune article about her in 2005. Dave King of Happy Apple and The Bad Plus plays drums, Chris Morrissey plays bass, and the album features Low's Alan Sparhawk on the track ""Give it Up."" Also on that track is David Frankenfeld, Haley's former drummer, who played on The Size of Planets. One year after Lure the Fox was recorded, Haley signed with local label Afternoon Records, who then released the album nationally in October 2006.

The album also topped many Twin Cities year-end favorite lists, including those of the Star Tribune, City Pages, The Onion, and Pulse magazine. Haley was also featured on the cover of Metro magazine. Big Star, released in June 2008 on Afternoon Records, gained Haley a broader audience with songs like ""Big Star,"" ""Green Eyed Boy,"" and ""Arms of Harm,"" which was featured on the credits for an episode of Showtime's The United States of Tara.

Upon completion of her album Golder, released in 2011, she also started a side project band called Gramma's Boyfriend, a ""no-wave, new wave, punkish kind of thing that sounds like the Twin Peaks High School prom band."" Jeremy Ylvisaker (Andrew Bird, Alpha Consumer, Guitar Party), Jacob Hanson (Halloween, Alaska, Guitar Party, Minneapolis Dub Ensemble), Haley Bonar, Luke Anderson (Rogue Valley, Alpha Centauri), and Mike Lewis (Happy Apple, Fat Kid Wednesdays, Andrew Bird, Gayngs) are all members of Gramma's Boyfriend, though the band's website states that ""sometimes they all play together, sometimes its whoever shows up.""

"After two and a half years of writing and recording, Haley released the album Last War in May 2014. The album earned widespread critical acclaim, with Stephen Thompson of NPR calling Haley ""a bright, subtle storyteller, [who] displays a mastery of pop-rock craftsmanship that keeps these songs as relentlessly catchy on the surface as they are alluringly complex underneath."" SPIN lauded the track ""No Sensitive Man"" as  ""dynamic, demanding,"" while Consequence of Sound stated that ""Bonar creates a whimsical masterclass of indie-pop songwriting."" The album earned spots on best-of-2014 lists from Rough Trade, NPR's All Songs Considered, Village Voice and Wondering Sound, the latter of which said of the album, ""It’s a bold, confident statement, and it’s an early pick for one of the year’s best.""Her album Impossible Dream was released in August 2016.
