"Jerry was born in 1963 as the second child to the Best family. At that time, his family was living in Flushing Meadows in the borough of Queens in New York.
",2,== Personal life ==
"His family moved often after the job of Jerry’s father, and he ended up living in seven states during the first 18 years of his life. When he was around ten years old, his older brother Tom started teaching Jerry some chords, initially with an electronic guitar and later with a bass. Soon, they formed a band called Zeus, and played mostly at school and other local events. Later, after graduating from high school, Jerry moved to Los Angeles, where his father and mother had already moved. In Los Angeles, Jerry played with bands such as T-zer and Mansfield, together with Pete Preston and Doug Aldrich.
