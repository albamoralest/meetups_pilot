"Blo. Torch is a Dutch melodic death metal band from The Hague. Freely mixing genres, their style has also been described as black metal. Formed by Marvin Vriesde and Hassan M9echtar in 1996, they got their first big break when their debut demo titled ""The Plot Sickens..."" got a great review in Terrorizer magazine, which caught the eye of Earache Records label manager Dan Tobin. After contacting the band and listening to more material, he offered BloTorch a record deal with Earache sublabel Wicked World Records. Blo. Torch released their self titled debut album on Wicked World in 1999. Blo. Torch and Wicked World parted ways in 2001.

"The founding members, Hassan Moechtar and Marvin Vriesde were quickly joined by Sander Koole (formerly with Cypher). After a demo, they recorded an eponymous album, which was picked up by Wicked World, a sublabel of Earache Records, who signed the band in 2000. Quickly, however, the band complained about lack of support, and recorded and released the follow-up, Volatile, independently. Since recording that album, the band has played smaller festivals and venues in the Netherlands.

"In July 2005, Vriesde left the band (he is also active in Dew-Scented) and was replaced by Rory Hansen, formerly of Bagga Bownz.
