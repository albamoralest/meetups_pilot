"Martin Lass was born in Chicago in 1958 to Earle Lass (born 1931) and Ruth (born 1933); he has two siblings. At the age of eight, he became interested in playing violin after seeing Yehudi Menuhin on a TV show. The Lass family migrated to Australia in 1969. He graduated from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and then joined the Australian Chamber Orchestra. He also played with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra (the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra). Lass was a contestant on Bert Newton's TV talent quest, New Faces, in 1982, winning the Grand Final and People Choice awards. Then a touring career ensued, in which he combined classical, gypsy and popular genres including jazz, bluegrass and Celtic. He has also written much original material. He appeared as the Fiddler in two seasons of Fiddler on the Roof in Sydney. In the 1980s he was a frequent television performer, including regular appearances on The Midday Show with Ray Martin and Hey Hey It's Saturday. He supported major stars such as Luciano Pavarotti, Julio Iglesias, Kamahl and Joan Baez. He won the Mo Award for Instrumental Act for eight years consecutively, from 1984 to 1991. By January 1989 Lass had, ""developed a stage show which combines unique stage clothes with a

"powerful stage presence. His playing is backed by four other musicians, who also feature in their own right as a band. His wife plays synthesisers and is the musical director."" He was voted the Variety Club Artist of the Year 1990. He recorded 10 CDs and sold over 250,000 albums. According to The Canberra Times' Vanessa Johnson, ""[he] has revolutionised the classics, playing music which links Bach, Vivaldi and Beethoven to jazz, country and rock 'n' roll.""Lass returned to the United States in the 2000s, for ten years, and has periodically returned to Australia. In 2002 he recorded his ninth album, Sonnet, at Galactic Studios in Nyack, New York. For that album he provided art direction, design, audio engineer, keyboards, mastering, mixing engineer, piano, producer, and violin. AllMusic's Alex Henderson rated it at three-out-of-five stars and explained, ""[it] is an example of the more classical-influenced new age, and even though the material falls short of mind-blowing, all of it is pleasant and sincere.""Martin Lass's piano accompanist is his Dutch-born wife Inge, who made her Carnegie Hall debut at age 14 and studied at the New England Conservatory from age 16. They have three children and two grandchildren. Lass was a practising professional astrologer from the late 1980s to the mid-2000s. He has written astrological books and articles, and given presentations to astrological societies. His book, Chiron - Healing Body and Soul (Llewellyn Worldwide, 2005), has become a definitive text about Chiron, the ""planet"" of Wounding and Healing. In addition to this, in Sydney, for eight years, Lass was a student of an esoteric school of self-knowledge under George M. Adie (1901–1989), a disciple of George Gurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky.
