"Brondi toured in Europe as a guitarist and singer, known for singing Italian regional folk songs. She was also a composer of guitar works. She wrote a book on the history of the guitar, titled Il liuto e la chitarra (1926), which was published in several editions through the twentieth century. She was mentioned as a peer of Italian musicians Elisabetta Oddone (1878-1972) and Geni Sadero (also known as Eugenia Scarpa, 1886-1961), though both of them outlived her. Julian Bream mentioned her as making early lute recordings, in company with Suzanne Bloch and Diana Poulton.
