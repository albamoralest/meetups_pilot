"Ray had an interest for jazz, funk and soul music which led him to buy turntables. He began DJing as a teenager in the 1980s around his native Essex and Suffolk. This was before he got his break DJing on the London acid house and rave scene. He started working as a recording artist and producer for his own style of music and other genres in 1990. One of his early remixes was a bootleg mix of Orbital's Chime in 1990, which was then officially released in 1992. He found his niche with drum and bass music. He is famed for producing bass heavy yet soulful tunes and has made classics such as the jungle anthems ""Terrorist"" and ""Chopper"". Ray set up Dread Recordings in 1994 and has produced numerous albums. He has also remixed Moby, Shades of Rhythm and Moving Shadow.
