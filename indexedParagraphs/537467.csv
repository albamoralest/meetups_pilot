"Joan Carmella Babbo was born to an Italian-American family in Chicago, Illinois, United States, one of six children supported by her widowed mother. As an adolescent, she studied drama and ballet, and on graduating from Bowen High School, located in the South Chicago neighborhood, went with a local dance group on a tour of Canada. She then took a job as a chorus girl in the Edgewater Beach Hotel in Chicago.After doing a fill-in in Indiana, she decided to pursue a singing career. Some executives at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) spotted her in a television commercial, and she was signed by MGM in 1952. Her first hit, ""Why Don't You Believe Me?"", sold over two million copies. She had a number of hits following that one, including ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" (a cover of Hank Williams' hit) and ""Have You Heard?"". She was the first American to record at London's Abbey Road Studios, and recorded five albums there. She was also very popular across parts of the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in the Philippines where she performed at Manila's now defunct EM Club in 1957. She also scored a big hit in Manila with Filipino composer Salvador Asuncion's work titled ""In Despair"".James had seven Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ""Why Don't You Believe Me?"" (No. 1 in 1952) ""Have You Heard?"" (No. 4 in 1953)  ""Your Cheatin' Heart"" (No. 2 in 1953) ""Almost Always"" (No. 9 in 1953) ""My Love, My Love"" (No. 8 in 1953) ""How Important Can It Be?""

"James married composer-conductor Anthony ""Tony"" Acquaviva at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York in 1956. In 1964, she retired from the music industry in part because Acquaviva was in bad health and needed her attention. She cared for him until his death in 1986.

"Shortly after her first husband's death, James met retired Air Force General Bernard Adolph Schriever, two decades her senior. He had led the crash program that developed U.S. ballistic missiles — both ICBMs and IRBMs in 1953–62. The couple wed on October 5, 1997, in Arlington, Virginia. They honeymooned in France and the Greek Isles, then took up residence in Schriever's home in Washington, D.C. Bernard Schriever died on June 20, 2005, aged 94.
