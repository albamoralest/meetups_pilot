"Lowery was raised on the east side of Detroit. His parents were from Pembroke, North Carolina. Lowery's father was a preacher. His aunt and mother taught him about Native American heritage, telling him Cherokee and Lumbee legends and teaching him about dreamcatchers. Lowery started making music at a young age, using anything he could find as instruments, and began writing his own songs at the age of 13. By the age of 15, local kids were paying to watch him perform in his garage.

It peaked at #4 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart, #42 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and #98 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote that ""Mostly, Hatchet Warrior is a rehash of [Psychopathic Records] mystique. References to Faygo abound and shout-outs to Detroit and the Juggalos are frequent, while much of ABK et al.'s raps are workmanlike run-throughs of familiar themes"".

Now I can either release it as it is through Native World Inc. or spend another year working on it creating new beats. What would y'all want me to do""? With that question, the answer was unanimously voted for, releasing it as is, since it has taken 3 years to release it.

"Lowery's lyrical content draws heavily from Native American imagery. He refers to his style as being ""like a spiritual rap"". He states that ""I get a vibe from dreams, more or less. That's where a lot of my writing comes from. That and a lot of my fans' personal experiences. [...] It's their music, my fans' music. I'm just putting it to words behind lyrics for them.""In his review of Hatchet Warrior, Johnny Loftus describes the album as crossing Native American culture with gangsta rap and horror themes and humor derived from Juggalo and cannabis culture. Lowery has a lisp, which gives him a distinctive delivery. According to Lowery, ""A lot of fans will say, 'Oh, he's just doing that to make it up.' Why would I want to make up a lisp while I'm rappin? I wish it was gone sometimes but a lot of people love it.""
