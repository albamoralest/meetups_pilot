"Farrell released her first single, ""Hit Me Up"", in January 2007. The song was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Happy Feet. It found moderate success internationally charting in various parts of Europe, topping the charts in Hungary and peaking at No. 6 in Australia.

"In 2007 she recorded three songs ""You'll be Sorry"", ""Can & Cannot Do"" and ""Stupid For You"", however none were officially released as part of a CD or album. This was due to Gia Farrell leaving her label Atlantic Records because they did not release her album due to a change in internal staff and management.

"During this time in her early career, Gia had several managers and handlers including Doug Davis son of the legendary Clive Davis. After parting ways with Doug, Gia was forced to find new management. Gia's new manager was an unscrupulous individual who attempted to derail her career, steal her money and keep her in the dark. Unfortunately, he was successful at straining her relationship with her label. After a lengthy court battle and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, Gia won a court case against her manager and permanently parted ways with him.
