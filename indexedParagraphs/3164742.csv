"Lahiri was scouted in Covent Garden at age 14 by Select Model Management in London. She was sent on an audition for what she thought was a music video which turned out to be an audition for a musical group. At first, she was reluctant to audition but changed her mind. She performed All Saints' ""Never Ever"" and was chosen to become a part of the girl group Precious. The band was chosen by British viewers to represent the UK in the 1999 Eurovision Song Contest with their first single, ""Say It Again"", and arrived 12th. After that, they released their first album, called Precious, which yielded two Top 10 hit singles: ""Rewind"" and ""It's Gonna Be My Way"". In the summer of 2000, the band tried to enter the United States market. In November 2000, they released their last single, called ""New Beginning"", with a video clip set in an industrial warehouse with the girl band acting like tough girls. By the end of 2000, the group went under scrutiny and the members decided it was time to stop.
