"Cultus Sanguine was founded as a duo in 1993, but soon after expanded to a trio after adding a drummer. After a 1995 EP, they added the keyboards player Rex Nebulah before signing to Candlelight Records for the 1998 album Shadow's Blood. Following this the guitarist/bassist Aqua Regis and drummer Custus Arckanorum left the group, and guitarist Aurian and drummer Nox Perpetua joined. Two further releases appeared on Season of Mist before the group disbanded in 2001.
