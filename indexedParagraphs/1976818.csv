"During his residency at Atomic Nightclub, Graham was discovered by label executives and signed to Hope Recordings; one of his first productions, “Airtight”, was noticed by Nick Warren and Paul Oakenfold in 2000. Oakenfold subsequently put two of Graham's tracks on his album Another World. Tiesto also put “Airtight” on his In Search of Sunrise 2 album. That same year, “Airtight” was nominated for a Juno Award. He gained immediate acclaim and was voted #23 in the DJMag top 100 DJs for 2001 and was chosen to mix the famous Tranceport CD Series (Tranceport 4) that year.

"In 2004, Graham signed two singles to Sander Kleinenberg's Little Mountain label, entitled ""Does She Know Yet?"" and ""Automatic Weapon"".

"From 2008 to 2017, Graham released a new Cycles CD almost every year as a self-proclaimed “snapshot” of his current DJ sound. He also began touring exclusively playing open-to-close shows, where he focused on a wide variety of genres and a true journey of music. Producing under his own name, he made singles ""Sun In The Winter"", ""Nothing Else Matters"", and the hit ""The Evil ID"", which was championed by Armin Van Buuren at Tomorrowland. Graham also performed regularly at A State Of Trance shows. During that period, Graham teamed up with Protoculture to release a string of singles and remixes, including a remake of Grace’s ""Not Over Yet"".

"In 2015, Graham began to move away from trance (due to the changing sound that no longer appealed to him) and left Armada, closing down his Rebrand label in the process. His sound changed, and he started the label Cycles with Black Hole Recordings. This period saw more underground releases, like ""Redemption"" and ""One Hundred"", and showcased deeper sounds such as the tracks ""Argentina""  and ""Sunrise in Flight"". He also collaborated with Estiva on the track ""Generation"".
