"Eric Adams can hold high note screams for 30 seconds at Manowar shows. Adams's main vocal influence is Ian Gillan. Adams declared in an interview that he used to go to every Deep Purple show as a young man because he loved Gillan's voice. However, he also worked to create his own, personal style. In his prime, his voice covered more than four octaves, from bass G1 to the soprano C6. As Adams has aged, his vocal high end has decreased, so recent Manowar albums are tuned lower than earlier albums.
