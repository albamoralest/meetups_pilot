"Kiyoharu's musical career began in 1986 as a member of the independent band Double Bed, which folded after a few months of activity. He then formed Sus4 in 1987, before later joining Garnet. After the disbandment of Garnet in 1991, Kiyoharu, as well as former Garnet bassist, Hitoki, formed Kuroyume. Kuroyume began in the beginning days of the visual kei movement. They progressed from a typical dark image and sound, to a heavy sound influenced by punk rock. The band ended as only a duo with Kiyoharu and Hitoki remaining. After tension on how the band should be managed and health problems for Hitoki, the duo ended the band in 1999.

The label would sign its first act outside Sads, Merry, for their first album Gendai Stoic.
