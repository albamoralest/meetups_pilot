"Barbara Ess was known primarily for her large-scale ambient and shadowy photographs that were often made with a pinhole camera. They were usually printed with just one earthy color, such as amber or muted blue-black. They are shown internationally in solo and group exhibitions and reviewed extensively.

"Her images are intentionally left vague and unresolved. As such, they initiate a range of emotions from dream anxiety and helplessness, to being captivated by a fantasy and the romantic aesthetic quality of her old-fashioned pinhole method. Her pictures hark back to the nineteenth-century approach to fine-art photography known as Pictorialism and to the well-known amateur photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. The Pictorialists and Cameron often included nature, women, and children as subject matter, creating tableau vivant imagery that evoked moody, open-ended narratives.
