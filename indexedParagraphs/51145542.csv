"Kamelot was founded in Tampa, Florida by Youngblood and Richard Warner in 1991. They signed their first contract in 1994 with German label Noise Records. Six albums were released through the label. After the release of Epica in 2003 they started working with SPV/Steamhammer. With them they released The Black Halo (2005) and Ghost Opera (2007), after a temporary switch to Edel Music for the release of Poetry for the Poisoned (2010), they were back with SPV for another release with Silverthorn (2012). Currently the band is under contract with Napalm Records, Universal, ADA/Warner and King Records  and released the album Haven in 2015. Youngblood was the main composer of Kamelot's music from 1994 to 1998, collaborating with singer Roy Khan from 1998 to 2010. When Khan decided to leave the band, Tommy Karevik (Seventh Wonder) became the new singer. The new composing/writing team of the band consists of Thomas Youngblood, Oliver Palotai (keyboards), Sascha Paeth (producer) and Tommy Karevik (vocals). During Kamelot live shows Youngblood sings backing vocals and harsh vocals (""March of Mephisto"") if needed.

Youngblood collaborated with Mark Vanderbilt (ex-Kamelot vocalist) in the late 1990s for a project called ""Monarque"". The song ""Arion"" was released on the compilation CD ""Powerquest – The Awakening"". Consortium Project is the brainchild of Ian Parry, vocalist of the Dutch band Elegy. Youngblood and Ian Parry met when Elegy toured with Kamelot in 1998. When the first album Consortium Project was recorded, Youngblood was part of it. Other contributions by Patrick Rondat, Arjen Lucassen, Stephan Lill and others. Youngblood also contributed on the second album Continuum in Extremis in 2001. He has co-songwriting credits for ""Poetic Justice"". In 2003, Youngblood was invited to play guitars on the metal opera Days of Rising Doom by supergroup Aina, a project of Amanda Sommerville, Sascha Paeth, Robert Hunecke-Rizzo and Michael Rodenberg. In 2003, another collaboration between Ian Parry and Thomas Youngblood came to fruit. They recorded the song ""Flight of Icarus"" for the Iron Maiden tribute double album Slave to the Power.
