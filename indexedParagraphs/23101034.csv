"Price was already on the road drumming by the age of 16.  One of his first prolific gigs was playing drums for the band Scandal.  He performed on the band's classic Warrior album before moving on to Billy Idol. In 1986, he started drumming for Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, and he's been a member of the band for the past 28 years, even though he was originally just a studio musician.

"On the side, Price formed the band Price/Sulton with his childhood friend and music partner Kasim Sulton. They cowrote the music and Price played guitar and did vocals. They released a full-length album on CBS Records called Lights On. The song ""No T.V. No Phone"" was featured in the 1987 film The Allnighter, starring Susanna Hoffs. Price is currently drumming in his own band in New York City. They recently finished recording an EP, Sex, Drums & Rock ’n’ Roll, and some of their songs are featured in the soundtrack of Sweet Life, a film with Joan Jett.
