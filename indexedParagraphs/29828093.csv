"Maria Teresa Pelegrí i Marimón (4 March 1907– 18 March 1996) was a Spanish composer. She was born in Barcelona and studied piano as a child. When she married, she gave up her musical activities, but after twenty years renewed her interest. She studied piano with Joan Gibert and Carles Pellicer, counterpoint and fugue with Josep Poch and composition with Josep Soler. She also took classes on twentieth-century music with Carles Guinovart. Personal papers (scores) of Maria Teresa Pelegrí are preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya.
