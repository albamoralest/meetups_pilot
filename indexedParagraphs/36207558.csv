"Triphon Silyanovsky graduated both from the Law Faculty of Sofia University and from the State Academy of Music, Sofia majoring in Composition under Professor Pancho Vladigerov and in Piano under Professor Dimitar Nenov. He also studied History of Art and Stylistics with Hans Sedlmayr in Vienna (1941–43). In 1948 he won the first Bulgarian Singers’ and Instrumentalists’ Competition, an event that resulted in a number of recordings for the Bulgarian National Radio’s Golden Fund.

"After the instauration of the communist regime in 1944, his professional career was interrupted and his music was banished up to 1959. He was persecuted by the authorities for political reasons and was sent to a concentration camp (1949–51); he was periodically jailed thereafter and was exiled from Sofia. He got a living as a labourer, played the piano in restaurants and taught Latin and Ancient Greek. Not until 1959 was he allowed to work as an accompanist at Sofia Opera.
