"A guitar player and vocalist, Sawtelle was one of the original members of Hot Rize. He also played the character Slade in the band's alter ego Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers). Sawtelle was born in Austin, Texas, but he grew up in Colorado. Before Hot Rize, Sawtelle was a member of the bands the Rambling Drifters (along with Tim O'Brien and Pete Wernick) and Monroe Doctrine. In Hot Rize, Sawtelle played the bass until he replaced Mike Scap on guitar. Sawtelle also worked behind the scenes to ensure Hot Rize maintained a professional demeanor. After the members of Hot Rize went their separate ways in 1990, Sawtelle formed the band Charles Sawtelle and the Whippets, including Fred Zipp (mandolin, vocals), Jim-Bob Runnels (banjo), and Dan Mitchell (string bass, vocals). Sawtelle also performed and recorded with Peter Rowan. Sawtelle recorded his one solo album Music From Rancho deVille while he battled the leukemia that led to his death. His friend Laurie Lewis co-produced the album, and ensured its posthumous release. Besides Lewis, the album features Michael Doucet and Vassar Clements (fiddles), Todd Phillips (bass), Flaco Jiménez (accordion), Jerry Douglas and Norman Blake (guitars), David Grisman, Sam Bush, and Tom Rozum (mandolins), and, from Hot Rize, Nick Forster, Pete Wernick, and Tim O'Brien. Sawtelle operated the Rancho Deville Recording Studio near Boulder, Colorado, and it remains in operation today as the Sawtelle Recording Studio. After Sawtelle's death, flatpicking guitarist Bryan Sutton joined Hot Rize for their return to performance, touring, and recording.
