"Shane Steven Filan was born on 5 July 1979, in Sligo, Ireland. He is the son of Peter and Mae Filan (née McNicholas). Filan is the youngest of seven siblings; three brothers and three sisters. From a very early age, Filan worked behind the counter of his parents' business- a diner in Sligo -including on school Holidays. He attended primary school at a local Catholic school, and secondary school at Summerhill College, with future Westlife bandmates Kian Egan and Mark Feehily. All three of them participated in a school production of Grease. The Hawkswell Theatre became a significant part of their careers.

"Filan was a fan of Michael Jackson as a child, and claimed the singer inspired him to pursue a career in music. Before Westlife, he studied business and accounting.

"Before Westlife, Egan and Feehily were with Filan in a band known as Six as One and, later on, IOYOU, with other Sligonians Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael ""Miggles"" Garrett. He co-wrote the IOYOU song ""Together Girl Forever."" For six months, Shane's mother, Mae Filan, tried to phone Boyzone manager Louis Walsh, eventually succeeding in talking to him about her son's band. Three of the members were dropped and the other three, Filan, Egan, and Feehily, joined in finding two more singers for the band. The members that joined were Nicky Byrne and Brian McFadden, forming Westside. The name of the band was subsequently changed to Westlife as there were already a number of bands with the name Westside. Filan, along with Feehily, became the co-lead singers of the band. Their first album was released in November 1999, titled Westlife.

"On 20 October 2011, Westlife announced that they had decided to split and go their separate ways at the end of their 2012 Farewell Tour. Filan showed interest in being a solo music artist for his daily living. In December 2011, press reports announced Filan was close to signing a solo deal with one of several potential competing UK record labels. Filan and his manager Louis Walsh, had been in talks with several of the labels at the time. ""There's four, possibly five labels so far who have made it clear that they want to sign Shane,"" said a music source to showbiz writer Paul Martin. In a March 2012 interview with Paul Martin, Filan said he would be signing within the next few weeks.
