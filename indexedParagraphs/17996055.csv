"Ricotti was born in London, England, into a musical family and took up percussion, following his father who was a drummer. He came to the attention of teacher Bill Ashton who encouraged him to extend his studies. Ashton embarked on a project that eventually became the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Ricotti concentrated on the vibraphone and developed his talents as a composer and arranger, playing in the NYJO while a teenager and then attending Trinity College of Music between 1967 and 1970.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ricotti led his own jazz quartet. A line-up of the band featuring the guitarist Chris Spedding, bassist Chris Laurence and drummer Bryan Spring recorded the album Our Point of View, released in July 1969. In 1971, in partnership with bassist Mike de Albuquerque, he released the album First Wind (as 'Ricotti and Albuquerque').

Between 1984 and 1987, Ricotti wrote the soundtrack music for Yorkshire Television's The Beiderbecke Trilogy, in the style of Bix Beiderbecke. The music was performed by his band, the Frank Ricotti All Stars, and featured Kenny Baker on cornet. A soundtrack album was released in 1988. Later, in June 1993, it peaked at No. 73 in the UK Albums Chart. Ricotti and his band made a cameo appearance in the final series, playing in a jazz club.
