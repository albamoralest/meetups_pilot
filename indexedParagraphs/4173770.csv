"Googe was born in Yeovil, Somerset, England. Prior to joining My Bloody Valentine, she played for a band called Bikini Mutants in her hometown of Yeovil, who gigged with The Mob. Googe had moved from Yeovil to London, and in early 1985, an ex-girlfriend of hers recommended her as a bass player to Kevin Shields and Colm Ó Cíosóig of My Bloody Valentine. She joined the band after an audition in April 1985. She left the group in 1996, noting she ""hadn't been happy for a long time"". Googe is known for her raucous style of bass playing in MBV's live performances.
