"Aarset has worked with Nils Petter Molvær, Bill Laswell, Jon Hassell, Jan Garbarek, David Sylvian, and Marilyn Mazur. After several albums for Jazzland, he recorded Dream Logic for ECM (2012), collaborating with Jan Bang and Erik Honoré on the production and timbral design of melodies and soundscapes. His style has been associated with nu jazz and electronic music. At the 2013 Punkt Festival in Kristiansand, Norway, he accompanied Arve Henriksen, Jan Bang, Erik Honoré, and Ingar Zach, celebrating the release of Narrative from the Subtropics by Jan Bang and Places of Worship by Arve Henriksens, in addition to performing a special ""Dream Logic"" concert with Jan Bang, Audun Erlien, Wetle Holte and Erland Dahlen. John Kellman at All About Jazz named Eivind Aarset Dream Logic's appearance at Punktfestivalen, Kristiansand, Norway in September 2013 one of the 25 Best Live Shows of 2013.
