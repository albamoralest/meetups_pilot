"Myrick was killed in Los Angeles, California by a Santa Monica policeman during a narcotics investigation. While attempting to serve a search warrant, Police Officer Gary Barbaro mistook a butane lighter in Myrick's hand for a weapon. He fired a single bullet that hit Myrick in the chest. Myrick died in the hospital shortly afterward, aged 53 years. Following a funeral service at a Baptist church, his body was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles County.

"Myrick was survived by his mother, Antoinette Myrick-Carr (now deceased), wife Barbara (now deceased), and three daughters; Shani, Lauren, Shirika Myrick, and a cousin, Elliot Myrick. In 1995, their wrongful death lawsuit against the city was settled for $400,000. The song ""For a Friend"" by Phil Collins, released on the CD single ""We Wait and We Wonder"" in 1993, was a tribute to his friend, who actively participated in Collins's songs and shows for many years.
