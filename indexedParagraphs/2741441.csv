"Dailor first started playing in a band called Evisceration from 1991 to 1993, when the band broke up. Dailor was also a founding member of mathcore band Lethargy, and the progressive rock/funk metal band Gaylord and played with Today Is the Day. In 2015, Dailor announced his side project called Arcadea. The group features Dailor on drums alongside Atlanta musicians Core Atoms and Raheem Amlani. Dailor, Bill Kelliher, and Brent Hinds portrayed ""wildlings"" on S05E08 episode of Game of Thrones, which was filmed in Belfast in Northern Ireland. As previously reported, the band's original song ""White Walker"" is featured on the Game of Thrones mixtape Catch the Throne Vol. 2, but in the instance of their physical appearance, a press release from Reprise Records reports that the band was personally invited to participate in the show by Game of Thrones executive producer Dan Weiss, who is a fan of the band. Dailor appeared in a balloon suit from OppoSuits at the 2015 Grammys. Together with Brent Hinds who sported a full Dodgers outfit they made several headlines. Dailor appeared on a 2018 episode of the History Channel reality show Counting Cars called ""Heavy Metal Caddy"" in which he had his 1970 Cadillac Coupe DeVille restored. He calls his car ""Twinkle Toes"".

"Dailor's main influence is Phil Collins of Genesis in its 1970s era. He said that watching Sean Reinert with progressive metal band Cynic opened his eyes as a teen about the possibilities of technical drumming. He is also inspired by Mikkey Dee, Dave Lombardo, Elvin Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Stevie Wonder and Dave Witte. Dailor's metal bands before Mastodon, Lethargy and Gaylord, were both heavily influenced by avant-garde rock group Mr. Bungle.
