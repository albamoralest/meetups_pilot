"Uppermost started producing music using FL Studio at the age of 17. His music has been released by Sony BMG, Ministry of Sound, BugEyed Records, Starlight Records, and his own label, Uppwind. His song ""Equivocal"" reached 3rd place in the Beatport electro-house chart in 2009 and in 2011 his Biscuit Factory EP ranked 1st on the JunoDownload electro-house chart. Uppermost has remixed Daft Punk, deadmau5, Burial, Crystal Castles, Johnathan Coulton, Syl Johnson, Congorock, Gregor Tresher, Cyberpunkers, OniMe, Jesus Luz, Spencer & Hill and Felguk. He has been playlisted by artists such as Tiësto, Armin van Buuren and Steve Angello and remixed by the popular Swedish dance duo Dada Life. In 2010, Uppermost released 41 tracks for free on his MySpace page under the aliases Uppermost, Alonely and Downed. Uppermost is currently working to promote his record label, Uppwind. His goal is to ""...create a network where people can share art with each other; an artistic community where all talents can meet and learn from each other."" Uppermost's idea to create music came from ""an urge to express what I (Uppermost) felt at the time, some kind of nostalgia, music seemed to be the only language to translate this emotion.""On 19 September 2011, Uppermost released his debut album, Action, on his own label, Uppwind. It was made available for purchase on Beatport and Amazon on 28 November. On 19 December 2011, he released his second album, Polis, for free on his Uppwind blog, just two months after the release of Action. Uppermost began performing at live events in early 2012, starting with his gig at Alte Kaserne in Zurich.
