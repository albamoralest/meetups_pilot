"Eddie Hardin (19 February 1949 – 22 July 2015) was an English rock pianist and singer-songwriter. Born Edward Harding, he was best known for his associations with the Spencer Davis Group, Axis Point, and Hardin & York. Hardin, along with the drummer, Pete York, left the Spencer Davis Group on 26 October 1968, due to 'differences over musical policy'. Hardin and York performed as a duo on and off over the years and Hardin cut his solo debut Home Is Where You Find It in 1972. Both men rejoined the Spencer Davis Group in 1973 but the band broke up again after two albums. Hardin continued as a solo artist, occasionally reuniting with York, much of his work from 1974 onwards was produced by Roger Glover who had recently left Deep Purple. Hardin featured on Glover's solo project The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast that year, singing lead on the track ""Maximus Mouse"" and playing on and co-writing others.
