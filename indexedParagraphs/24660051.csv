He was one of the first hip-hop artists to become established, which also includes Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, Salt-n-Pepa, and Slick Rick. “Hip-hop was fun and energetic during this time. Hip-hop was just growing, so there was a lot of creativity and great live performances,” says Chuck. “Run-DMC and Whodini were some of the best live performances during this time”. After leaving Kiss FM in 1989, Chuck joined 107.5 WBLS FM in 1990 for two years. Chuck worked in 1995 by becoming one of the first DJs to play hip hop music in Japan. Hip-hop artists such as Busta Rhymes, A Tribe Called Quest, and Run-D.M.C. became known in Japan as a result. ""Hip hop was very popular in Japan"", said Chuck, ""The people there knew the history of the artist I was playing as well as mine. Japanese people were totally into the culture"".
