"After high school, Scott Sharrard and core members of his band The Chesterfields moved their home base to New York City and eventually garnered critical appraise for their live shows and studio recordings. After they disbanded in 2002, Sharrard continued to write and record on his own as well as collaborating in the New York City and Hudson Valley areas with a tightknit group of musicians that includes bassist Jeff ""The Claw"" Hanley, drummer Diego Voglino and multi-instrumentalists Moses Patrou and Jay Collins, longtime saxophonist for the Gregg Allman Band who eventually got Scott an audition.
