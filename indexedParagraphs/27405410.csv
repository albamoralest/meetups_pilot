In early 2020, Grum announced the launch of his own record label, titled Deep State Recordings, after his album of the same name. Human Touch, was originally his sophomore album due to be released in October 2013, but was delayed until April 2014. It was subsequently pushed back again to 2015. Additional singles from the album include ""The Touch"", ""Raindrops"", and ""Sunday Blue Sky"". Human Touch remained unreleased until March 2021, when he announced that he had re-acquired the rights to the album, and was subsequently released in that same month on Deep State Recordings.
