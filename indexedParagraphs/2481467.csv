"Nelson attended the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, in Pennsylvania. There, he and his friend Nathan Morris, joined later by Wanya Morris, Shawn Stockman, and Michael McCary, formed the singing group Unique Attraction. After hearing New Edition's song ""Boys to Men"" on the radio one evening, the group changed their name to Boyz II Men. In 1989, the group met Michael Bivins and began making arrangements to sign the group to a major label and begin recording. In the interim, the group encountered delays in recording their album. Nelson grew impatient and left the group and began recording his debut solo project.
