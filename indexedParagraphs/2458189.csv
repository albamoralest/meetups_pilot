"María Luisa Ramsey also known as Jaya was born on March 21, 1970 in Manila, Philippines. Her mother was Elizabeth Ramsey, a Filipina comedian and singer of Jamaican and Spanish-Filipino descent. Ramsey's father is Reynaldo Kagahastian, a Filipino. Her parents separated when she was young, and her father migrated to the United States. He now resides in Alberta, Canada.
",2,== Early life ==
"She started show business at the age of ten as a backup dancer of her mother and at the age of 12 she started to be a backup singer and frontacts in some minor and major shows. She began performing solo in 1982, using the name Louise Ramsey.
",3,== Early life ==
"The young Louise did not finish high school in the Philippines because of her busy lifestyle as a child performer. She nonetheless managed to receive high marks and was once elected class president.

"Her mother Elizabeth decided to leave for the United States in June 1985, and brought Louise with her. There she continued her solo singing stints, performing with other Overseas Filipino artists like Tillie Moreno, Eddie Mercado, Lerma dela Cruz, and the duo Reycards.
",6,== Early life == | === In the United States ===
"Life in America was likewise difficult for both Jaya and her mother. They stayed in different cities in California. She attended John Marshall High School in Los Angeles, which at the time already had a large Filipino-American student population. She ran away from home in 1988 after finishing high school, moving to New York with a friend and landing a job as a backup vocalist for Stevie B's group of musicians.

"Ramsey was re-christened ""Jaya"" in 1989 by her American producer after signing a record deal in the United States. After one year, Jaya moved to Florida, where she was offered to be a ghost-singer for an album but after listening to her voice, the management decided to do the album with Jaya.

"1995 was a turning point in Jaya's musical career. Pilita Corrales, dubbed ""Asia's Queen of Songs"", noticed her voice after Jaya did an opening act for Corrales, Carmen Soriano, the late Bert ""Tawa"" Marcelo, and Elizabeth in the United States. Corrales then asked Jaya if she would like to return to Manila and record an album, to which she agreed. Jaya returned to the Philippines and signed a record deal with Viva Records in March 1995 and completed her first local album. Five songs were recorded in the US while the rest were done in the Philippines.
",12,== Career == | === Philippine debuts ===
"Jaya is noted for being the Philippine music industry's female record holder of a seven-times platinum album. She was a big hit when Pinoys first heard her belt out soul ditties in 1996. Her winning the 1996 Metropop Song Festival via Danny Tan's ""Sometimes You Just Know"" made her the biggest star on the rise at the close of the last century. Her first album under Viva Records hit an all-time high of 9 times platinum. In 1997, she released her third album In the Raw, (second in the Philippines) the follow-up to her massive-selling 1996 Philippine debut album, Jaya, which sold nine times platinum, (360,000 units; platinum is 40,000 units sold). In this year also, 1997, she started performing in SOP, a Sunday variety noontime show in GMA Network.
",13,== Career == | === Philippine debuts ===
"She also won as Best Interpreter at the Asia Song Festival held in Hong Kong in February 1997 for her rendition of the song ""You Lift Me Up"", composed by Danny Tan with lyrics by Dodjie Simon. This composition also received the grand prize, the Best Song award.
",14,== Career == | === Philippine debuts ===
"She adorns Magpakailan pa Man (Up to the End), with soulful, Toni Braxton-styled flourishes, and renders the upbeat, ""Together"" with panache and verve. Her assured handling of the delicately nuanced, ""Sana'y Maulit Muli"" (May it Recur Again), is a tour de force. The album sold quintuple-platinum (200,000 units sold). She released a Christmas album, entitled Kung Kailan Pasko which contained traditional carols alongside original compositions, including a jazz version of The Christmas Song. In 1999, PolyMax Records, a label of then-PolyGram Records Philippines (now an affiliate of Universal Records) released Jaya's A Love Album, first released in 1992 in Japan under the same title. The album consists of songs taken from an earlier Jaya album, also called A Love Album, released in the United States in 1989, as well as songs recorded specifically for the 1992 Japanese release. In 1992, while touring Japan as a backup singer and keyboardist for American R&B artist Stevie B., Jaya was approached by the Japanese label Toshiba/EMI to make an album for Japanese release. A Love Album was released in Japan in conjunction with Jaya's American label, LMR Records, which still owns master rights, and from whom PolyMax obtained permission to release the album in the Philippines (according to Kazu Watanabe, managing director of PolyMax Records). A Love Album is exquisitely produced, and Jaya acquits herself well on the album's upbeat R&B/dance-styled tunes and soulful ballads. In 1999, Jaya released, her fifth album released in her native country since 1996, entitled Honesty originally done by Billy Joel, was also her career single.
",15,== Career == | === Philippine debuts ===
"Honesty differs greatly from Jaya's two previous major albums released in the Philippines, 1996's Jaya and 1997's In the Raw. Though, as before, Honesty contains mostly passionate, easy-listening love songs, this time out her approach is more intimate. She doesn't add many soulful flourishes as before, nor does she allow herself to soar passionately to the heavens, which she often did on her previous albums.
",16,== Career == | === Philippine debuts ===
"Another major difference is the inclusion of three modern, rhythm and blues styled songs, including, ""We Thang,"" ""Tear to Fall"" and ""In My Dreams."" These songs are far more contemporary and have much more international appeal than the easy-listening love songs which dominate Jaya's music. After five years in the recording scene, she released her first greatest hits album, entitled Five featuring a duet of Habang May Buhay (While There's Life) with Regine Velasquez and Kung Wala Na (If It Is Gone) from the Abandonada soundtrack.
",17,== Career == | === Philippine debuts ===
"In 1999, Jaya faced a big challenge when she did her first musical, the Ramayana-based Rama at Sita that starred Lani Misalucha. Her performance as the demon king Ravana's sister, Soorphanaka, was memorable for her skillful treatment of risque songs and sultry dancing. Also in 1999, Jaya was offered to be a main host in a GMA Network variety show called SOP.

"In 2001, Jaya released her sixth Unleashed album. Jaya sings in a relaxed, confident manner, and performs middle-of-the-road songs that mostly have depth and quality. Jaya mostly foregoes the soulful embellishments that were plentiful in her first two albums, 1996's Jaya and 1997's In the Raw, although every so often she adds a few unwritten notes in a passionate, soulful manner. She approached her last album, 1999's Honesty, in the refined manner that she furthers on Unleashed. Jaya covers Roy Orbison's ""Love Hurts"" and John Lennon's ""Love"" in an understated, yet enjoyable manner. Johnny Nash's ""I Can See Clearly"" features an imaginative, bass-heavy arrangement. In 2001, she released her first live album, entitled, Jaya Live at the Araneta. The album is dominated by performances of American hits. For example, the album starts with a performance of Aretha Franklin's 1960s hit ""Respect"", and also includes Labelle's ""Lady Marmalade"", Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" and Roy Orbison's ""Love Hurts."" She performs several of these ballads here, including her first hit in the Philippines, ""Dahil Tanging Ikaw"" (Because It's Only You). Several guest artists also have spots, including Regine Velasquez, who performs Abba's ""Dancing Queen""; boy band Jeremiah, who accompanies Jaya on remakes of songs by American boy bands, including Westlife's ""Swear It Again""; and male singers Wency Cornejo, KC Montero, and Rivermaya's vocalist and songwriter, Rico Blanco. After 4 years of hiatus in the music scene, Jaya returned with her seventh studio album entitled, Fall in Love Again. Friends, old and new helped Jaya put the album together. One of these is Ogie Alcasid, who composed and produced ""Ako'y Sa'yo"" later revived by Regine Velasquez, ""Maging Akin Ka Lamang"" and their duet of ""Bakit Di Mo Sabihin"". Another one is Vehnee Saturno, who wrote and produced most of Jaya's early hits. His contributions are ""Pagkukunwari"" and ""Di Na Ba Kita Mapipigilan"", which is the album's first single release.

"In 2007, she released her eighth album Cool Change under her new label, GMA Records, featuring covers of international hit songs including Donna Summer's ""On the Radio"" and the Chaka Khan's ""Through the Fire"". All of the songs were presented with new arrangements in various musical genres. The first single was ""Is It Over?"" originally sung by Ronnie Milsap which received Platinum award in 2009. After her Platinum Record solo album, ""Cool Change, "" Ramsey released her ninth studio album entitled, Real. Love. Stories. It contains 14 love songs carefully picked and beautifully revived by the Philippine's Queen of Soul, such as ""Breathe Again"" originally sung by Toni Braxton; ""Old Friend"" by Phyllis Hyman and ""Save the Best For Last"" by Vanessa Williams.

"The concept album will be released initially on a limited edition micro secure digital format and after two weeks, it will be available on physical CDs and digital downloading. Jaya was also part of Kaya Natin Ito single cd. The project was supported by Gawad Kalinga to help the tropical storm Ondoy and Pepeng victims that killed more than half a million people all over the country.

She played the nosy landlady Helen de Herenes in Kaya ng Powers, a sitcom that starred Joey Marquez and Rufa Mae Quinto as a couple from outer space.

"Jaya released an album under Universal Records entitled All Souled Out, a CD album containing 12 tracks of all revival songs. It was her third cover album, containing classic R&B and jazz songs that she grew up listening to. The album received a critical response, after experimenting with a variety of sounds in her previous outings, ""Jaya comes to terms with what she is really all about as a singer in ""All Souled Out."" She triumphs in making the material sound genuine, largely because it is perfect for her. And her voice is a thing of wonder. There is warmth, power, and vulnerability in her renditions, making listening to the entire album a breeze—perfect for long drives or for those lazy weekends.""
