"Born and raised in Chinapoo, Morvant, Laventille, Trinidad), Ataklan underwent vocal and performance training in his formative years from Ras Shorty I, who has been recognized as the inventor of what we now know as modern Soca music. Ataklan was a foundation member of the four-member Rapso group called Homefront from 1992 to 1993 under the Kiskidee Karavan. Ataklan was also the founder and manager of a youth musical initiative called ""The Laventille Bucketeers"" which consisted of 12 young Laventille residents playing original music compositions and rhythms on plastic buckets. The Bucketeers had appearances on Local Talent shows including ""Party Time"", winning best original act and scoring second place twice in a row. Subsequent to this, the artist founded his own record label, TAJ Records (named after his son Tyrone Anthony Jiminez), operating out of his hometown.
