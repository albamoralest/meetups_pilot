By age four, he performed alongside great masters of the Gnawa all over Morocco (including king of the Gnawa genre, master Sam) and in Casablanca for Lila.

"Hakmoun began learning Gnawa music from his mother, a mystic healer in Marrakesh who organizes derdeba trance ceremonies, which are often all-night affairs involving hypnotic playing and chanting to exorcise spirits. Hakmoun witnessed his first trance ceremony at the young age of four. He proceeded to study Gnawa music after a musical ceremony that healed his sister Mina Hakmoun. He eventually chose the sintir as his main instrument, a three-stringed lute with a body made of camel skin stretched over nutwood. The strings of the sintir are pitched low, enabling the instrument to serve as the bass foundation much like the Western string bass, while its tone is sweet, making it well-suited to carry the melodic line of a composition. By drumming on the body of the instrument, Hakmoun added his own percussion while contributing vocals, thereby creating a unique foundation for his musical explorations and growth. By the age of fourteen, he was an established musician performing at Gnawa lila ceremonies with his own ensemble. Today, Hakmoun is known as the godfather of Gnawa music.
