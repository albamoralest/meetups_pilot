"At the age of 21, Diamond produced Lou Reed's Coney Island Baby for RCA Records, the same year he and brother Gregg Diamond hit number one with ""More, More, More"" for The Andrea True Connection, with Godfrey's drum parts later appearing on Len's hit ""Steal My Sunshine"". The success of ""More, More, More"" led to the formation of the creative nucleus known as the World Radio Band consisting of Gregg, Godfrey, Steve Love and Jim Gregory. This team wrote, produced and arranged many dance/pop artists including Bionic Boogie, Hot Butterfly/Luther Vandross, Gloria Gaynor, Star Cruiser and George McCrae who were instrumental in creating the disco sound.
