"Avsec joined the band Wild Cherry immediately following the recording of the disco hit, ""Play That Funky Music"" (1976). He was brought in as a session keyboardist for two tracks on the band's debut album, and was then asked to join the group.  He also toured with the band, performing ""Afternoon Delight"" at the 1976 Grammy Awards. During this period, he befriended Donnie Iris, with whom he composed Donnie Iris & The Cruisers' hits ""Ah! Leah!"" (#19 Billboard Mainstream Rock) and ""Love Is Like a Rock"" (#9 Billboard Mainstream Rock).

"In 1980, Avsec wrote and produced the debut album for the band LaFlavour which garnered the hit single ""Mandolay,"" climbing to number 7 on Billboard's Disco Chart. Avsec later released ""Mandolay"" himself under the artist name Art Attack.  By the time Avsec composed LaFlavour's follow-up album, the band's label, MCA, had decided to change the band's name to ""Fair Warning,"" due to interest in disco music tapering off. The lead-off Fair Warning single composed by Avsec was called ""She Don't Know Me,"" which was taken by MCA from the Fair Warning debut album and given to New Jersey's Bon Jovi, who were preparing their debut album for PolyGram's Mercury label. The label felt Bon Jovi needed the song as a single, making Avsec one of the only outside songwriters to compose a song released by Bon Jovi.  Avsec has played with other musicians such as Mason Ruffner and The James Gang featuring Joe Walsh, Jimmy Fox, and Dale Peters.

Since 2003, Avsec has taught ""Law of the Music Industry"" at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, and he teaches ""Representing the Musical Artist"" through the Great Lakes Sports and Entertainment Law Academy, a program that Case Western Reserve University School of Law offers in affiliation with the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.
