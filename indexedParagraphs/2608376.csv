"In January 2010, Finch left Marvel and became a DC Comics exclusive artist. Finch collaborated with Grant Morrison on Batman #700 (Aug. 2010) an oversized anniversary issue. In July 2010 DC announced that Finch would be writing and drawing a new ongoing series entitled Batman: The Dark Knight, the first story arc of which deals with the detective's more supernatural cases.

The winning entry's character, Infernal Core by Anthony Kosar, was featured in Justice League Dark #16 (March 2013), which was published January 30, 2013. The episode premiered on January 22, 2013, as the second episode of the fourth season. Finch and Geoff Johns launched a new Justice League of America series and the Forever Evil limited series in 2013. Finch and his wife, Meredith Finch, took over the creative duties on Wonder Woman beginning with issue #36 (Jan. 2015), their first collaborative effort.
