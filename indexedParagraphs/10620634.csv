"Born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Merrill started playing bass at age fourteen, having traded in his train set for the instrument. Before joining Godsmack, Merrill worked as a self-employed carpenter, a trade likewise pursued by Tony Rombola. Merrill lives in St. Augustine, Florida, with his wife Heather and daughters Nianna, Nikiah, and Neven. Although he plays lefthanded, Merrill writes righthanded due to a birth defect that renders him unable to move the middle finger of his left hand.
