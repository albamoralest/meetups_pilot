"Born Maria Grazia Di Michele in Rome to parents from Abruzzo, at very young age, she founded with Chiara Scotti and Clelia Lamorgese ""L'Ape di Vetro"" (""The Glass Bee""), a politically inspired musical group which disbanded after a few years. She debuted as a solo singer at Folkstudio, a music venue in Rome, in 1977. In those years she also worked in a cultural club in Rome, the ""Johann Sebastian Bar"", and worked as a disc jockey in radio. Her first album Cliché, characterized by provocative lyrics about feminist and social themes, was released in 1978. In 1983 she released the album  Ragiona col cuore, of which the title track tells the story of a lesbian love, then in 1986 she got her first and major commercial success with the single ""Le ragazze di Gauguin"" and with the album with the same name. Between 1990 and 1993 she entered the Sanremo Music Festival three times, ranking third in 1993 with ""Gli amori diversi"", a duet with Rossana Casale.
