"Tyson is from Mooloolaba on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. At 14, he became keen on dance music, particularly trance and began DJing. His parents encouraged him to play an instrument, but he became interested in turntables and songwriting. He began participating in competition when he was 16. One competition misprinted his nickname ""Tydi"" as ""tyDi,"" which led to the stylization of his stage name. Tydi graduated from Queensland Conservatorium of Music with a Bachelor of Music Technology. In 2006, he entered Junkee's Australian Top 50 DJs at No. 12, and No. 4 the following year. In 2008, he reached No. 1, becoming the youngest person to top the chart.

"In 2009, TyDi released his debut album Look Closer, which reached No. 2 in the Australian Dance Charts. It featured 15 predominantly trance tracks. A review from Junkee's In The Mix stated, ""Look Closer is an absolute belter of a debut, and displays a musical maturity way beyond Tydi's years."" Electronic music website Trance.nu wrote that Look Closer was ""of world class quality the likes of some of the best trance and progressive artist albums out there."" A few months later he mixed a disc for the annual Ministry of Sound Trance Nation release and continued at No. 1 for the 2009 Junkee DJ chart. During 2009 and 2010, Tydi released singles such as ""You Walk Away"" (featuring Audrey Gallagher), ""Good Dream"", ""Vanilla"" (featuring Tanya Zygar), (again featuring Audrey Gallagher) and the anthem ""Half Light"" (featuring Tanya Zygar). In February 2010, he won ""Best Break-Through DJ"" at the International Dance Music Awards (IDMA), against Boys Noize, Chuckie, Joris Voorn and Super8 & Tab.

It featured collaborations with vocalists such as Tania Zygar, Brianna Holan, Audrey Gallagher and DJ Rap. Talking Reviews said ""For want of a better description, this musical journey is nothing short of astounding and breath taking"". Meanwhile, Beat Magazine described the final track, ""Ariana,"" ""could be rated the best album outro of 2011."" About half of the tracks have been released in extended club mixes or remixes.

"TyDi's fourth album, Redefined, was released on 30 September 2014. The project features vocals by Chris Carrabba and Jordan Witzigreuter. The album reached No. 5 on both the US and Australian iTunes dance charts on day of release. According to TyDi, Redefined represented a change in his approach to music creation, focusing more on songwriting rather than just hooks and rhythms. The album took three years to write and produce, during which time approximately 300 songs that were started were whittled down to the final 20. The album was not genre specific with house, progressive house, pop (ish), trance and chillout tracks all making the final cut. The title track, ""ReDefined"", reach number one on the dance airplay charts in the US in April 2015. Following the making of the music video for the song, it was revealed that Redefined was the final piece in a planned sequence. The trilogy begins with ""Live This Lie"" and ends with ""Stay"" but ""Redefined"" was the missing middle piece completing the story.

"On 14 July 2015, tyDi revealed that a new artist that had appeared on SoundCloud early in 2015, was in fact his alter-ego. According to the post, Wish I Was was his ""darker"" side. The post also suggests, Wish I Was came about because Tyson had entered an extended creative block when trying to write songs as TyDi. However, after writing about half the tracks that eventually came out on the debut Wish I Was EP, internet publications began to report on the producer, at first suggesting it might be the work of Galantis before TyDi eventually owned up to the project himself. On 6 May 2016, the first Wish I Was EP was released on iTunes featuring 15 tracks. Collide is TyDi's sixth feature album and is a collaboration with composer Christopher Tin. Released 8 March 2018, it took 3 years to create. The album featured 12 tracks. TyDi stated in July 2018 he had been asked to work on some songs in the worldwide Disney on Ice production.
