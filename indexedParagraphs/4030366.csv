"Ivana's father worked along the Black Sea coast with his orchestra. One night during a concert, after their lead singer had gotten sick, she was offered to substitute for her, singing several Bulgarian folklore songs. Ivana had great response from the audience and she was immediately offered to perform with the orchestra for the summer. She was 14 years old at the time and really liked being on stage. Later on she formed a band called ""Prima +"", consisting of herself, Stoyana and Rumen Radoinov. The group was invited to sing at the hotel estate `Prikazkite`, where Ivana’s talent was noticed by Payner music company owner – Mitko Dimitrov (Bulgarian: Митко Димитров), who shortly after offered her to sign a contract with the studio. Vanya Todorova Kaludova adopted the stage name Ivana and it didn't take long before she started making hits. Her first single was `Idol`. The second single - a duet with Kosta Markov, called `Darvo bez koren`(A tree without roots) - was released soon after. Her third single – `100 patrona` (100 bullets), which also served as her debut album title, became one of the biggest hits in the pop-folk genre in Bulgaria and still one of the biggest hits in pop-folk to date. The album was released in 2000, making her one of the hottest names in the music industry in the country. The following 8 years with her work and hits Ivana proved to be one of the biggest Bulgarian stars. Often cited ""the people's singer"" by the media and her fans, she is loved by many, not only for her music, but also for her cheerful persona and easy communication with her fans.
