"The band combine modern technology with archaic instrumentation over various media. The members have said they have dedicated their lives to art, to explore the nobleness of centuries in many possible ways (music, poetry, theatre, and photography). They define themselves as ""craftsmen of the sound"" because they create an unusual mix of sacred and profane, atmospheric and experimental, contemporary and early music, using acoustic and electric instruments as well, always with such language which fits best to the actual work.
",4,== Style and lyrical themes ==
"The word ataraxia is taken from Epicurean philosophy and means ""equanimity"", ""calmness"" and ""unflappability"". Ataraxia place themselves in a spiritual tradition from Greco-Roman and Celtic cultures. Nicoli has described the production process as ""medianic"" and associated it with the cult of Dionysus, where ""the musician was possessed by the God of Nature who spoke through him/her"". Regarding the band's pagan themes, Nicoli associates the word paganism with the countryside, and maintains that life in the countryside creates a connection to the rhythm of nature. In that sense, she considers Atarax a pagan band: ""I feel that I'm in a communion with that which surrounds me"".
