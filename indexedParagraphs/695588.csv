"He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. In his birth year, Parlan was stricken with polio, resulting in the partial crippling of his right hand. The handicap contributed to his development of a particularly ""pungent"" left-hand chord voicing style, while comping with highly rhythmic phrases with the right.
