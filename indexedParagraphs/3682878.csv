"In April 2008 it was announced that Cooper would release a ""solo album"" under the name Matthew Robert Cooper. Writing on the Temporary Residence message boards Cooper explained the change ""this is not far from something ""eluvium"" would release—but since I began writing them—I felt that they were somehow disconnected from eluvium—perhaps a different personality took shape—thus, the use of a different name - this work is very dear to me.""Miniatures was issued in 2008 on a limited vinyl release on the fledgling Portland label, Gaarden Records. The album was limited to 2,000 copies with the first 1,000 on colored vinyl.
