"The little information about his adolescence is revealed to us in his book Il principe. It is better to be feared than loved where the rapper tells of having lived for four years, in the Roman suburbs, with an alleged leukemia at the age of 15 which later turned out not to be such, but which marked him to the point of later manifesting an obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Junior Cally admitted abusing alcohol at age 20 only to realize he had to take his life in hand and change it: ""I told myself do something, live your life better. I tried to make up for lost time"". He found considerable success after the episode that occurred on September 4, 2019 in the video clip of the single Tutti con me, which anticipated the release of his second album Wanted, released on September 6, 2019. In the first scenes of the music video, the Roman rapper, always known with a gas mask on his face, he decided after two years of career, to reveal his identity by showing himself to the public.
