"And Duguid was born in Gütersloh, Germany on 16 November 1982. He moved to England before relocating to Scotland around 1990, where he has lived since. He started producing around age 14, after experimenting with keyboards and pianos for several years since he was 10. He released his first single ""Hypocrisy"" on Black Hole Recordings in 2006 and reached 5th place in the Dutch Dance Charts. His next single, Don't Belong, was received and featured on In Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza. In October 2007, before ""Wasted"" was created, Andy was asked by Black Hole to create an album so it would be released a year later.

"After being asked to create an album, Duguid released his single """"Wasted"" in 2008 which was included on In Search of Sunrise 7: Asia. The song became an opening track with Banyan Tree's Feel The Sunrise. In October 2008, Duguid released his first studio album Believe, which features long-time friend Iris Morrison (Leah) also known as Alanah, Mr. Sam and his friend Solarstone, Esmaye, who is also part of Black Hole's repertoire, Donna & Anthony, I-Fan, and Julie Thompson, whom he is currently helping to produce her first album to be released on Black Hole after her return to the dance scene with Tiësto's ""Somewhere Inside"" which had also appeared on in Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza. It also included Duguid's remix once it was released as a single on Magik Muzik. After the release of Duguid's album and the time of the his brother's death, he confirmed that he wrote White Sands together with his brother which is the last track on Duguid's album. Speaking to Vh1 India, Duguid said, ""This track means so much. You can lose pictures or videos of your loved ones but this is something that will be around forever and it makes me very proud of my brother.""In December 2008, he joined Radio Volum as part of their program on Saturday nights from 10:00 to 12:00. During the first 45 minutes, Duguid opens his set followed 15 minutes of ""Chance"" in which Andy lets unsigned artists show some of their own tunes and their mixing abilities. From 11:00 to 11:30 he plays a selected number of classic anthems from the electronic dance music scene. The last 30 minutes of the program include his closing set which is similar to the opening. The radio show is now syndicated to a number of stations worldwide, including Dance Paradise Brazil, to a listenership of over two million people.  In October 2013, Duguid told Vh1 India that After Dark Music was put on hold to be restructured and would be fully up and running by the Christmas season.

"The track ""7even"" featuring vocals from Jaren Cerf was released on 14 October 2013, and is the fifth single off of Duguid's second album On the Edge.  On his Facebook page, Duguid explained that the song and music video are based on the story of Olivia Downie, a young girl who died after a long battle with neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer. Her story made national headlines while her parents raised funds for her treatment. When the song became available for download on digital music stores, Andy announced that he would donate all of the royalties he earned off of the track to cancer research in Olivia's name.
