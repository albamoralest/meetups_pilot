"Coleman grew up in Mayodan, North Carolina, graduating from Madison-Mayodan High School in 1969 where he was a part of bluegrass and folk groups. After working as a sound technician each time Doc Watson came to nearby Appalachian State University, Coleman played bass with Doc Watson and his son Merle starting in 1974 and continuing until 1986. Coleman also toured with Doc Watson and David Holt during the final three years of Doc's life.

"After his time with Watson, Coleman joined the Seldom Scene, replacing Tom Gray. Coleman was with The Seldom Scene from 1986 until 1995. There were initial objections to Coleman's use of an electric bass in the normally acoustic bluegrass lineup, but Coleman's playing fit the group's sound.

With no banjo, they were more acoustic country than bluegrass. Chesapeake disbanded in 1999 when their contract with Sugar Hill ended.
