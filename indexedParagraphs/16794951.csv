"Boheme was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 1986. When she was fifteen, she and her mother went to Los Angeles to look for a record deal. They returned to Wisconsin unsuccessful. In 2004 Mike Melvoin, a native of Oshkosh, was nominated for a Grammy Award, and Boheme sent her congratulations. Melvoin asked her to work on his records, and he became a mentor. When she was eighteen, she was offered a contract by Concord Records, which released her debut album, What Love Is, in 2006. Her second album, What a Life, was produced by Michael Bubl√©. In 2017, Boheme sang at the inauguration of President Donald Trump.
