"Abrigo is the Artistic Director of POURQUOIPAS , a non-profit association organizing concerts, masterclasses and projects with social commitments, which she founded in 2015 with the Swiss violinist Madeleine-Murray-Robertson. With POURQUOIPAS she created in 2017 for Pully Sound Sound Festival an educational experience titled ""Niccolò Paganini: the mystery"": a one hour itinerary discovering truth and mysteries of the composer's life, that ended with a final concert. In February 2021 POURQUOIPAS launched the crowdfunding campaign in support of the violinist Corinne Chapelle, affected by a rare form of cancer. The campaign raised +200.000 Euro in three weeks, involving dozen of Classical Music Stars (Nicola Benedetti, Renaud Capucon, Vilde Frang, Steven Isserlis, Igudesman and Joo, Corina Belcea..) and many International Newspaper, Radio and Media (The Times, Radio France, Le Figaro, The Strad, The Violin Channel...). Tragically, Corinne Chapelle died five weeks later, after an intensive care in Germany.
