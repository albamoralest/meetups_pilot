"André Wormser was born in Paris and studied with Antoine Marmontel and François Bazin at the Paris Conservatoire. As a very wealthy man, Wormser was able to afford a membership in the social club Cercle artistique et littéraire. In 1872 Wormser won the Premier Prix in piano at the Paris Conservatoire, and in 1875 he won the Prix de Rome for his cantata Clytemnestre. He is best known for the pantomime L'Enfant prodigue (1890), which was revived at the Booth Theater in New York in 1916 as the three-act play Perroit the Prodigal. He died in Paris.
