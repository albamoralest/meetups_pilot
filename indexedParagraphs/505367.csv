"Whitford graduated from Reading Memorial High School in 1970. After attending the Berklee College of Music, Whitford played in local bands Cymbals of Resistance, Teapot Dome, Earth, Inc., and finally a band called Justin Thyme before joining Aerosmith in 1971, replacing original guitarist Ray Tabano. Aerosmith would go on to be one of the most successful bands of the 1970s. However, following a string of less successful albums in the late 1970s, Whitford left the band in 1981 to work on his own project with singer Derek St. Holmes, simply called Whitford/St. Holmes. The project was dissolved after a sole self-titled album was released in 1981, although Whitford/St. Holmes reunited for a 2015 tour, at which a follow up album titled Reunion was sold.
",2,== Career ==
"Whitford briefly toured with the Joe Perry Project, featuring former Aerosmith bandmate Joe Perry, before both Perry and Whitford rejoined Aerosmith in 1984.  In the mid-late 1980s, all band members completed drug rehabilitation, including Whitford, who completed programs to combat his alcohol abuse.  Whitford remains sober to this day and continues to be an active member in Aerosmith.
",3,== Career ==
"Whitford also served as a producer for a well-known Boston band, the Neighborhoods, who were led by a rabid Aerosmith fan, David Minehan. When, in 1994, Whitford was forced to leave unexpectedly in the middle of an Asian tour due to family illness, Minehan was flown to Japan where he performed in Whitford's place for several days until Whitford returned.

"Whitford missed the start of Aerosmith's 2009 summer tour after requiring surgery as a result of a head injury sustained while getting out of his Ferrari, joining the tour after a month.
",5,== Career ==
"In 2010, Whitford was announced as one of the guitarists to take part in the Experience Hendrix tour, playing songs performed and inspired by Jimi Hendrix along with other musicians such as Joe Satriani, Sacred Steel, Jonny Lang, Eric Johnson, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Ernie Isley, Living Colour, Hubert Sumlin, Chris Layton, and bassist Billy Cox. Along with fellow Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, Whitford was included in the Guitar World book The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time in 2007. In November 2015, Whitford/St. Holmes reunited for a 10 show tour.

"While Joe Perry is Aerosmith's better known guitarist and the band's principal songwriter with Steven Tyler, Whitford has made significant contributions to the band's repertoire over the years. This includes co-writing Aerosmith's hit ""Last Child""  as well as some of Aerosmith's heaviest songs: ""Nobody's Fault"" and ""Round and Round"", and playing lead guitar on ""Sick as a Dog"" and ""Back In the Saddle"" (on which Perry plays six string bass), ""Last Child"", and on the ballads ""You See Me Crying"" and ""Home Tonight"" He also plays co-lead with Joe Perry on songs such as ""Train Kept A-Rollin"", ""Lord of the Thighs"" and ""Love in an Elevator"". The version of ""Lord of the Thighs"" on their 1978 live album Live! Bootleg in particular is perhaps his most famous soloing moment.  When Aerosmith made their comeback in the late 1980s, Whitford continued to co-write tracks such as ""Permanent Vacation"" and ""Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man"", and plays occasional lead guitar on some more recent tracks as well as during many live performances.

"Concerning his lesser role in the band's songwriting process, Whitford has said, ""I don't consider myself a terribly prolific writer. I can write music with other people if they're better songwriters than I am. I really can't create a song. It's very difficult to do. That's why the people that can do it are very few and far between. I'm certainly not that type of a guy. More of a guitar player, more of the kind of [guy] who comes up with enough riffs and ideas to write a song. But to write lyrics and come up with a melody for it, it won't happen.""Said Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler of the two guitarists, ""Joe is self-taught and his playing comes from raw emotion. Not that Brad's doesn't, but his style is more schooled.""

"Slash, lead guitarist of Guns N' Roses cites Whitford as one of his heaviest influences, stating: ""I identified with Joe Perry's image, both soundwise and visually....but I was also totally into Brad Whitford's guitar solos, and he had a more direct influence on the way I play than anybody realizes.""

Whitford continues to tour primarily with vintage Fender Stratocasters and Gibson Les Pauls for Aerosmith concerts as well as smaller gigs. Meanwhile, Aerosmith's original heyday in the late 1970s saw both Whitford and co-guitarist Joe Perry arm themselves with aggressive-looking guitars from BC Rich (Whitford favored an unpainted BC Rich Eagle, while Perry often played an alien-looking red BC Rich Bich).
