"Persson was born in Hässleholm, southern Sweden and started his music career by playing valve trumper in school. Persson, known as ""the Comet"" (or ""Kometen""), moved to Stockholm in 1951, where he played in Simon Brehm's quintet (1951–1954). Following this Persson worked with Arne Domnérus, Hacke Björksten, Harry Arnold's Radio Band (1956–1961), Quincy Jones, Lars Gullin, the RIAS Berlin band (1961–1975), and the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band (1963–1971). Persson played with many American musicians, including George Wallington, Roy Haynes, Benny Bailey, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Dizzy Gillespie. He led several sessions for labels such as Metronome, Philips, and EmArcy in the 1950s. Persson drowned in the Djurgården canal in central Stockholm in February 1975; he had driven his car into the canal either accidentally or deliberately. There is a book trombonist Åke Persson written by author Bo Carlsson.
