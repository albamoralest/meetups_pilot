"Joseph Hector Fiocco worked under his stepbrother's direction at the Ducal Chapel of the Notre-Dame du Sablon most sources cite some time before 1730. In 1730, Joseph Hector  became sous-maitre (submaster) of the Notre-Dame du Sablon; he did not keep this position for long, because he resigned in 1731 to become sangmeester (choirmaster) at Antwerp Cathedral.

"At Antwerp (1731–37) he was in charge of the music. In 1737 he returned to his birthplace and worked in the collegiate church of St. Michel and St. Gudule. He died in Brussels at the age of 38. In connection with his cathedral employment, Fiocco wrote many choral works, including motets and Mass settings.

"Some of his most significant compositions are Lamentations du Jeudi Saint,  a Missa solemnis and Pièces de Clavecin.  His two suites for harpsichord were dedicated to the Duke of Arenberg, and they incorporate French and Italian styles. The first suite begins in the style of Couperin and ends with four Italian-style movements: Adagio, Allegro, Andante, and Vivace. He is also known to Suzuki violin students for his Allegro, which is part of the Book Six Suzuki violin repertoire (and has been recorded by Itzhak Perlman, among others). This piece has also been arranged for string quartet, and is sometimes heard at weddings.
