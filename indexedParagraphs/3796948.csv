"Johan Liiva formed Carnage with his friend Michael Amott in 1988, and appeared on two demo tapes ""The Day Man Lost"" and ""Infestation Of Evil"", but left the band before their debut album was recorded in 1990.  He went on to form Furbowl as a guitarist/vocalist, with Max Thornell on drums.  The band released their debut album Those Shredded Dreams as a two piece on Step One Records in 1992.  The album also featured guest solos on two songs by Michael Amott (who also produced the recording).  Furbowl would add a guitarist, Nicklas Stenemo, and release their second full-length The Autumn Years in 1994 on Black Mark Production, but the project folded soon after.

"After the demise of Furbowl in the mid 1990s, Liiva once again teamed up with Michael Amott to form the band Arch Enemy in 1996.  After releasing their first album Black Earth in Japan that same year, the album became a success, receiving airplay on Japan's MTV Rocks! and in 1998 Arch Enemy were invited to tour Japan, and sign a new deal with Toy's Factory records.  Arch Enemy released Stigmata worldwide in 1998, and the band toured for the first time.  In 1999, the band released Burning Bridges, and Burning Japan Live 1999, the latter proved to be Liiva's last album with Arch Enemy.
