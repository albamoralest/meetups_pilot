"Elgenes was raised in Kristiansund together with musicians Lynni Treekrem and Frode Alnæs. With the latter he started the pop band Dance with a Stranger in 1984, and they released five albums. His first solo album Som første gang (1997) showed Elgenes from another side, with Norwegian lyrics. His next solo project Remembrance (2000) was the exact opposite. Here he sing classic songs with English lyrics, accompanied by piano, sound effects and a chamber orchestra. In 2002 he started a new trio called ""AcousticMusicMachine"" with Inge Bævre (guitar) and Eivind Gjelberg (percussion). The music ranged from the more show-like the driving blues and soul, and most of it was self-composed material with Norwegian lyrics. The follow up was the solo album The Way Life Goes (2004) continued six years later with the last album Storm (2010). In 2013 he released his latest album Lucky One. This time his record was given some great critics and airplay. From 2013 he has been playing concerts with his own band ELGband.
