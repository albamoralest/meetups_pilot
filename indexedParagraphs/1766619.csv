"Ritz’s first collaboration was Brother Ray (1978), the autobiography of Ray Charles. Ritz has said that his initial intention was to write a biography until becoming intrigued by the idea of rendering the book entirely in Charles' voice. ""That's when I discovered I had a gift for channeling voice"", Ritz told the L.A. Times' Patrick Goldstein in 2012. ""That discovery changed the course of my literary life.""Other autobiographies co-written by Ritz include:

"The platinum-selling song ""Sexual Healing"" was written in Ostend, Belgium in April 1982 and is credited as a collaboration between Marvin Gaye, Odell Brown, and Ritz.  Ritz was not originally credited as songwriter, and his contribution to the song has been debated, with many sources claiming that he contributed only the title. Ritz sued Marvin Gaye for songwriting credit; Ritz received credit only after settling with Marvin Gaye's estate after the singer's death. Ritz claims that the lawsuit was settled because he had interview tapes with Marvin Gaye in which Gaye says, ""These are great lyrics you wrote.""David Ritz also co-wrote three songs including the title track from Guy King's 2016 album Truth.
