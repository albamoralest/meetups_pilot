"For several months, the three rehearsed and played shows around Denver. They decided to undertake a small-scale concert tour for 30 days, playing shows from Portland, Oregon to New York City. Of her decision to tour with the band, Pekarek said, ""I was only 23 years old. If you are going to be in a band and do something stupid, it might as well be then."" The 30-day tour was followed by a tour of the West Coast and a weekly installment at The Living Room, a venue in New York. While her contribution to the band was most noticeable as a cellist, she had a larger role as a vocalist in live performances, including performing a duet with Schultz.

I see myself working really hard to make everything equal between all of us. The boys are learning a lot about it and they've been really supportive, but there've been some growing pains.""
