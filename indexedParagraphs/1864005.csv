"== Personal life ==
",12,== Personal life ==
"From 2013 to 2018, Traoré had a relationship with Jan Goossens, a Belgian playwright and artistic director with whom she has a daughter, born in Belgium in 2015. Since their separation in 2018, the couple have been in conflict over custody of their daughter. In March 2019 Traoré accused Goossens of sexually touching their daughter and deprived him of any contact with the child outside Mali. Goossens appealed to the Belgian courts and reported the charges against him. In a provisional judgment, the judge decided that the child would have to spend part of the summer vacation with the father. Traoré ignored this legal judgment. Next the Brussels court of first instance granted the father the child's main residence while deciding that parental authority would remain joint, and that custody would be shared. For her part, Traoré filed three complaints against Goossens, whom she accuses of sexually touching their daughter. A first complaint in Belgium, in July 2019, was dismissed. A few months later, she filed a second complaint in Mali, and then another complaint in France. Malian justice, seized well after the first judgment of the Belgian justice and the international arrest warrant, decided for its part to grant Traoré sole custody of her daughter in a provisional order.
",13,== Personal life ==
"In October 2019, Belgian courts issued an international arrest warrant against Traoré for ""kidnapping, forcible confinement and hostage-taking"". She was given, however, a period of a few months to present the child. Not having respected the final deadline of 22 February 2020 granted by the Belgian justice, Traoré was arrested on 10 March 2020 in Paris. She was stopping over there on her way to Belgium to attend the appeal hearing she made. Incarcerated in Fleury-Mérogis prison, she immediately began a hunger strike. Released under judicial supervision, she fled to Mali: ""I am a mother who protects her children. So I packed my bags, headed for the airport, took a legal private plane. By virtue of the protection afforded to me by my Malian diplomatic passport, I was able to leave"".
