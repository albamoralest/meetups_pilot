"In his younger years, after playing other instruments for some time, Citron switched to playing guitar on the advice of his older cousin Howard Leese, who played with Heart. By the age of 17, Citron was a formative member of the band Hero, who were eventually signed to 20th Century Records, releasing two albums, Hero and Boys Will Be Boys. Eventually, the band would evolve into Head Shaker, fronted by David Donato, whose later credits would include Black Sabbath and the Geezer Butler Band.

"By 1995, Citron had joined the band of symphonic and progressive rock singer Lana Lane and played on many of her albums, including her 1995 debut Love Is an Illusion and Curious Goods, released the following year, which both enjoyed success in Japan. Touring would follow, resulting in the release of live material and several follow-up albums and the DVD Storybook: Tales from Europe and Japan, in which Citron is featured in both live performances and interviews. By 2002, he became more involved in solo projects as well as extensive studio work with artists such as Steve Vai, Steve Lukather, and Larry Carlton. That year, he received a Grammy Award in the Best Pop Instrumental Album category for engineering No Substitutions: Live in Osaka by Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather. His contribution to Lana Lane's albums would largely be guest spots in the studio from that point on.
