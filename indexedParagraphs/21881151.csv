"Born and raised in Orangevale, California and of Armenian descent, Deradoorian first found an interest in music at the age of five, when she was taught violin and piano at the private school she attended. Both her parents are artists and she has an older sister Arlene, who also tours with her performing solo material. At the age of 16 she decided to leave school and pursue a career in music. She moved to Brooklyn, where in 2007 she joined Dirty Projectors and played an important role in the recording of the album Bitte Orca. In 2012, she moved to Los Angeles together with her then-boyfriend Avey Tare. Deradoorian's debut EP, Mind Raft, was released under her surname in 2009 by Lovepump United Records. In 2009, she recorded a track with Vampire Weekend keyboardist Rostam Batmanglij and Ra Ra riot vocalist Wes Miles on their Discovery album LP. The track is entitled ""I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend"". Animal Collective chose her to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they curated in 2011. In 2011, she released a split 7-inch with Albert McCloud containing a song by McCloud entitled ""Planetarium 2010"" and her own song ""Marichka"". She was a member of Avey Tare's project, Slasher Flicks, along with ex-Ponytail drummer Jeremy Hyman, and released the album Enter the Slasher House in 2014. In 2015, Deradoorian released her debut solo studio album, The Expanding Flower Planet, on Anticon. In 2017, she released an EP titled Eternal Recurrence, which mixes obscure and ambient landscapes. Her second full-length solo album, Find the Sun, was released on September 18, 2020, by Anti- Records.
