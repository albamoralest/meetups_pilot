"Ritchard was born in the Sydney suburb of Surry Hills. His parents were Sydney-born themselves: Herbert Trimnell-Ritchard, a Protestant grocer, and Marguerite, a Roman Catholic who raised her son in her faith. Educated by the Jesuits at St Aloysius' College, he studied medicine at Sydney University. His career in medicine was abandoned in 1917 when he decided to become an actor.

"Dance teacher Minnie Hooper suggested Ritchard team up with one of her dancers, Madge Elliott, but Madge rejected him because he couldn't dance. Two years later, after a practice waltz, Madge and Cyril realized they were a team, and they went on a dancing tour of New Zealand. Madge and Cyril appeared in “Yes, Uncle!”  and “Going Up,” both in 1918. They then went their separate ways. Ritchard shared an apartment with Walter Pidgeon in New York while he appeared there, and Madge made her first West End appearance in 1925. Ritchard joined her in London and they reestablished the dancing partnership. In 1927 Laddie Cliff booked them to star in ""Lady Luck"" at the Carlton Theatre in 1927. In 1932 they returned to Australia where they were a hit. They appeared in a number of musicals, including ""Blue Roses.” Their swan song performance in Australia was their wedding  ceremony was at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, in September 1935. There were said to be 5,000 onlookers at the wedding;  Madge's four-yard £400 veil had a starring role. Ritchard achieved star status in 1954 as Captain Hook in the Broadway production of “Peter Pan,” starring Mary Martin, who had the same birthday (1 December). For his work in the show, Ritchard received a Tony Award as Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Both Ritchard and Martin reprised their roles in the NBC television productions of the musical, beginning with a live color telecast in 1955. In 1958, he starred in the Cole Porter CBS television musical “Aladdin”. In 1959, he won his second Tony Award, for Best Actor in a Play, for “The Pleasure of His Company.”
