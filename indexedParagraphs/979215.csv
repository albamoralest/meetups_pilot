"Tony Touch began as a B-boy during the rap music renaissance era of the early 1980s. Heavily influenced by pioneers like Crazy Legs and the Rock Steady Crew, Grandmaster Flash, Red Alert, Little Louie Vega and Jam Master Jay, he quickly shifted his interests towards the turntables. Tony is known for his mixtapes the 50 MC's. His mixtapes have featured guest appearances from Boot Camp Clik, Eminem, KRS-One, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Wyclef Jean, M.O.P., Big L, and Mos Def. In 2000, Tony released his debut album The Piece Maker on Tommy Boy Records. It sold 400,000 units worldwide and featured guest appearances from Big Pun, Cypress Hill, Wu-Tang Clan, Busta Rhymes, Eminem, and Gang Starr. In 2000 the single ""I Wonder Why"" featuring Total was released. The music video featured cameos from John Leguizamo, Rock Steady Crew, Grandmaster Flash, The Awesome 2, Marley Marl, and DJ Premier. Since then, Tony Touch has released The Piece Maker 2, which featured guest appearances from Puff Daddy, Fat Joe, Sean Paul, Snoop Dogg, and Ruben Blades. Tony Touch is also known to represent the urban Latino community with his Spanglish lyrics and Salsa roots. This is the result of him growing up with salsa at home and hip-hop influence in his lifestyle. In 2005 Tony signed to EMI records releasing a reggaeton album, ReggaeTony. The lead single ""Play That Song"" featured Nina Sky and B-Real of Cypress Hill. The CD included collaborations with artists such as Tego Calderon, Zion and Lenox, Pitbull, Ivy Queen, NORE, Voltio, Mexicano, Thirston Howl III, and Soni. The album went gold, and EMI moved quickly to release ReggaeTony 2. This CD featured Lumidee, Plan B, Joell Ortiz, Tru Life, Don Chezina, and the Beatnuts. To this date Tony has sold over a million records worldwide. On July 16, 2013, his sixth album The Piece Maker 3: Return of the 50 MC's was released and featured guest appearances from Busta Rhymes, Reek da Villain, Roc Marciano, Lil' Fame, Too Short, Xzibit, Kurupt, B-Real, Papoose, Uncle Murda, Black Thought, Styles P, Sheek Louch, Jadakiss, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, RZA, Eminem, Twista, Bun B, Action Bronson, Prodigy, Joell Ortiz, Royce da 5'9"", KRS-One, Crooked I, Redman, Method Man, N.O.R.E., and Erick Sermon.
