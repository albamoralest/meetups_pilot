"Kenny and Amanda Smith met at a Lonesome River Band concert, where Amanda gave Kenny a tape of her music. They decided to collaborate, and then decided to marry. Their first album Slowly But Surely in 2001 was recorded when Kenny was still with the Lonesome River Band and Amanda was working a day job. The album was popular enough to be listed on the bluegrass charts, and the Smiths decided to form the Kenny and Amanda Smith Band. They won the IBMA's Emerging Artist of the Year award in 2003. In 2004, they released the album House Down the Block. Ronald Inscore played mandolin, Steve Hubers played banjo, and Greg Martin played bass. The Kenny and Amanda Smith Band released Live and Learn in 2008, along with Zachary McLamb (bass), Aaron Williams (mandolin), and Ron Stewart (fiddle, banjo). On their album Unbound they were assisted by Wayne Winkle (vocals), Kyle Perkins (bass), Jacob Burleson (mandolin), and Justin Jenkins (banjo). The lead single ""You Know That I Would"" stayed at the No. 1 spot for consecutive weeks on the Bluegrass Today Weekly Airplay charts.
