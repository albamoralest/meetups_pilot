"She is one of the women pioneers in  electronic music composition in Great Britain for her earliest musique concrete pieces belong to the late 1950s. Daphne Oram was helpful and encouraging here. The influences on her music are diverse and include non-European music as well as the sounds of nature and industry. The use  of music technology allowed her to make sonic explorations and the use of microtonality. These influences  also enriched her writing for acoustic instruments as in ""Study of the Object no V"" (1970) for unaccompanied voices, a graphic score she calls sound sculpture, ""Mestra"" (1979–80) for solo flutes and ""Hunting Horns are Memories"" (1977) for horn and tape for which she worked out  quarter tone fingerings for the F/B flat double horn. How time passes is also intrigues her and she has experimented with polymetric and polytempi music. Janet Beat is included in the British Music Collection archive at Heritage Quay, Huddersfield.  She is an Honorary Research Fellow of the School of Culture & Creative Arts at the University of Glasgow and an Affiliate of the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery as a Curatorial Consultant.
