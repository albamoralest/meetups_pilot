"Johnston was married five times, and had five children.  One of his marriages was to actress Kathryn Grayson at an August 22, 1947 ceremony in Carmel, California. Grayson was his second wife. On October 7, 1948, the couple's only child, daughter Patricia ""Patty Kate"" Kathryn Johnston was born. Grayson and Johnston separated on November 15, 1950. On October 3, 1951, Grayson was given a divorce from Johnston on the grounds of mental cruelty. Johnston's This Time for Keeps co-star, Esther Williams, claimed in her 1999 autobiography that while making the film, Johnston would read Grayson's intimate letters aloud to the girls in his fan club, including the ""all-too-graphic details concerning what she liked about his love-making.""
