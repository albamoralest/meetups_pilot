Ton announced Nov/2021, that Kayak will embark on their 'Farewell Tour' (Spring/2022) throughout countries: The Netherlands, England, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.  This will take place during the 50-year anniversary of the band. He did not rule out the possibility of occasional reunion performances.   Scherpenzeel has a notable fear of flying, that has limited his touring to the European continent..

"2021: VELVET ARMOUR, the fifth solo album from Ton Scherpenzeel, was released via Friendly Folk Records.an independent label located in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Ton said in an interview with Irish Music Magazine/ (Nov/2021) that he was dubious about releasing an album like Velvet Armour commercially, and had considered releasing demos for free. When he made that statement on social media he was approached by owner of Friendly  Folk Records, Kathy Keller, who said she would be interested in releasing the album on her folk label. Ton mentioned that he loved Keller's dedication and enthusiasm and he signed with her label. He also told journalist Sean Laffey during the interview, 'I know I am not your typical folk artist but there are strong similarities and connections to that style'. The eighteen-track album reflects the essence of the Medieval Renaissance era, with a blend of Baroque Folk and Prgressive Rock Ballads. The album also includes an old Kayak number, 'My Heart Never Changed', originally released on the album, Royal Bed Bouncer (1975).
