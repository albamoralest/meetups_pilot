"Born in New York City, to middle class Jewish American parents, (His father, of German descent, was a factory supervisor, while his mother, of Hungarian descent, was a housewife), in the borough of Manhattan, Susser grew up in the borough of Queens, and attended Jamaica High School. He was a baseball pitcher and was honored by New York City as its ""Most Valuable Player"" within The New York City Baseball Federation League, 1957.  During his high school years, he wrote songs for some of his favorite artists, such as Dion and The Drifters. But, at the time, all of his attempts to reach these artists were unsuccessful. Four decades later, in 1998, Ben E. King, lead singer of the Drifters, recorded a collection of Susser's children's songs titled, ""I Have Songs In My Pocket"". Susser graduated from Queens College, City University of New York, Magna cum laude, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications. He received a Master's degree in communications in early childhood education from Teachers College, Columbia University, where he studied with Canadian scholar, and communication theorist, Marshall McLuhan. In 1961 he received an honorable discharge for serving in the United States Army.

"After producing four singles in 1961, and 1962 with his childhood friend Paul Simon, for the group Tico and The Triumphs, which included Susser's first Billboard Hot 100 chart record ""Motorcycle,"" on Amy Records, he concentrated on writing and producing rhythm and blues songs. He spent most of his days in New York's Brill Building, attempting to place his songs with music publishers, and receive advance monies, with the hope his songs would be recorded by popular artists. In 1963, he wrote, produced, and sold the master recording of the song ""Kiss Me Now"", sung by Florence DeVore, to Phil Spector. The record was the first release on Spector's new Philles Records subsidiary label, Phi-Dan Records. Soon Susser began recording his songs with Panama Francis, Bernard Purdie, Paul Griffin, Bob Bushnell, Al Gorgoni, and Horace Ott. From 1965 through 1973, he continued to write and produce songs for Florence DeVore, as well as for Sharon Redd, Lily Fields, Mamie Lee, Morgana King, Robert John, and Trini Lopez. While he published most of his new songs, the older ones that he had placed with other music publishers were beginning to get recorded. In 1971 he wrote and produced the controversial song ""Once You Understand"" on Laurie Records, sung by his own studio group, Think. After being banned from radio stations in several major cities, the anti-drug, novelty song sold 1.4 million records in the United States. The song later was sampled and covered by artists Biz Markie, Acen, 4 Hero, and De La Soul. Susser received letters from churches, synagogues, and schools inviting him to play his song and talk with teenagers about its anti-drug message. He started to write and produce songs and activities for children, ages 4 through 8. He registered the name, Bobby Susser Songs For Children, and the series began.  Titles from the early 1970s include ""Learning Basic Awareness Through Music,"" ""Pre-Physical Education Through Music,"" ""Pre-Square Dance,"" ""Let's Act As Consumers,"" and his series for young pre-readers, Doctor Alphabet. In 1976, Diana Ross recorded ""Kiss Me Now"", on her second, self-titled album.

"During the 1980s, he visited schools with his young children's songs. At that same time he also wrote and produced songs for his own pop, studio group, The Bobby Susser Generation. But he returned to writing and producing young children's music, and continued to appear in schools with songs and activities for his early childhood audiences. In 1991, he formed a new record company, ""New Hope Records"", in order to administer the distribution, sales, and license rights of his recordings. He wrote and produced songs for thematic albums, and by 1996 they had become some of the most popular young children's songs and recordings  used in day care centers, schools, churches, synagogues, and homes. He created ""The Bobby Susser Singers"", ""The Bobby Susser Children's Chorus"", and a logo caricature of himself, drawn from a photograph, for his series, ""Bobby Susser Songs For Children"", ages 2 through 8. Michael Green was often the lead male vocalist, and Deanna Jones was often the lead female vocalist on several of the early recordings within this series. By 1998, Susser broadened his guest list of vocalists, and began working with a greater variety of adult and children singers, and made guest appearances on his song series for young children. He continued to make changes in his personnel of singers and players depending upon the song, style, and subject matter.  In the year of 1999, he went back to visit young children's classrooms and lectured on the subject of young children's songs.

In June 2008, Susser released the collection of original young children's songs All Roads Leads To Home. One review stated, ""All Roads Lead To Home is a very solid choice to use with preschoolers, and its additional song, '70 (Bringin' It Home To You)', for all ages, makes for a wider family appeal"" and another said, ""All Roads Lead To Home"" is headed for the group of classic and standard young children's recordings.""In February 2009, Susser's children's series surpassed 5 million albums sold.

This incredible honor, reinforces my commitment to educating, and entertaining children through music and songs.""In June 2014, Susser, along with producers Kevin Mackie and Krista Wallinger, won the 13th annual Independent Music Awards in the Best Spoken Word (with music accompaniment) Category for ""ACTION MOVES PEOPLE.""
