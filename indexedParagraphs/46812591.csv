As part of his musical training at the Birka Folkhögskola in Östersund he came to pick up the upright bass and played in the regional symphony orchestra, with whom he also had guest performances and first television appearances. In 1990 he moved to Stockholm to study at the Kungliga Musikhögskolan. There he played in the group  Jazz Furniture  and in the quintet of Lina Nyberg, where he met Esbjörn Svensson.
