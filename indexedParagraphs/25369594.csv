"Aura Dione was born Maria Joensen on 21 January 1985 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Her mother is Faroese of French descent, while her father is of Danish and Spanish descent. Her parents introduced her to music, and she began writing songs when she was as young as 8 years old. Her parents were hippies who with Aura as a child sailed all the world's oceans, until the 7-year-old was given residence on Bornholm. Here, she began her formal schooling and as a teenager enrolled to Secondary school, but in the middle of her education she chose to move to Australia where she sought inspiration from the Aborigines. This later resulted into a song ""Something From Nothing"".
