"At Peñate's concerts, it is customary that audience members enter the stage while the song ""Torn On The Platform"" is performed. One such stage invasion at the Oxford Zodiac on 22 April 2007 resulted in a fan stealing Peñate's distortion pedal. After he'd realised it was missing he proclaimed,  ""D’you know what? Whoever's got it... keep it! Just make sure you play a Telecaster through it and not a Gibson!""
