"In 1939, Holland moved to New York City, playing in big bands led by Coleman Hawkins and Fletcher Henderson. From 1941 to 1946, he played with Charlie Barnet. He and Don Redman toured Europe in 1946, and during this tour Holland elected to remain there, living in Paris, France, and then Sweden. He recorded there until 1960, releasing some 46 records for European labels.
