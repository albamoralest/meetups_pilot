"His Musings EP was released in October 2015. “I Don’t Wanna Love You” was released as a single through Casablanca Records. He released ""Fragile"", a collaboration with Hailee Steinfeld as a single. He lost his grandfather before the song was created. Lassner spoke of the collaboration, describing it as 'superstitious' fate. His late-grandfather and Steinfeld share the same birthday date (December 11). ""Fragile"" was first presented to Lassner by his songwriter-friend Lil Aaron. He then re-arranged it and produced with a style he calls ""future pop"". When he sent the song to Steinfeld before reworking the lyrics to fit her voice. He later collaborated with Michelle Buzz to release ""Oxygen"", a single inspired by the death of his god-grandmother Shirley who died due to lung cancer.
