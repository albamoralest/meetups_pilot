"As a cabinet store worker by day and a musician by night, Hires always had a heroic passion for music. Hires' father, also a musician, introduced him to music at a young age, giving him the handmade guitar that he continues to play. Initially drawn to the punk, Post-hardcore, and Emo scenes, Hires later developed an interest in artists like Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, which explains the uniqueness of his vocal and instrumental harmonies that dabble in both traditional and contemporary musical realms.

"Hires released his debut EP, Live From the Hotel Cafe, under F-Stop Music/Atlantic Records, on October 7, 2008. Although only four songs in length, the EP gained him solid exposure, with critics comparing him to the likes of Jack Johnson, John Mayer, Matt Costa, Mat Kearney, and Bright Eyes. But still, critics conceded that Hires has a sincerity and authenticity of his own. Building his fan base in preparation for his debut album, Hires appeared at the SXSW Music Festival and on the 2009 Mayercraft Carrier. He has also opened for Dave Matthews, Marc Broussard, OAR, and Paolo Nutini.
