"Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Osby studied at Howard University, then at the Berklee College of Music. Osby's main instrument is alto saxophone but he occasionally plays soprano saxophone as well. He played with Jack DeJohnette's group Special Edition from 1985-1991 and has also recorded with Jim Hall and Andrew Hill, among many others. With Geri Allen, Steve Coleman, Gary Thomas, and Cassandra Wilson, he was a founding member of the M-Base Collective. He began recording albums under his own name for JMT Records in the 1980s, then recorded for Blue Note in the 1990s. In the 2000s, he formed his own label, Inner Circle Music. He gave exposure to young pianist Jason Moran, who appeared on most of Osby's 1990s albums, including Further Ado, Zero, Banned in New York and Symbols of Light, a double quartet featuring the addition of a string quartet to the band.
