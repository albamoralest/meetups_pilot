"Banks' style is notorious for its heavy sampling of old school R&B, pop culture and Japanese anime. Robb states his inspiration to rap comes from Biggie Smalls and that one of his favorite artists of all time is British quiet storm-style singer Sade. Robb has also mentioned Lil' Wayne, Webbie, SpaceGhostPurrp, his father and Slug as an influence to his sound. His tag ""I Think I Might Be Happy"" is synonymous with his music and is taken from a scene of the U.S. version of Skins. Banks frequently makes references to Japanese anime Naruto and calls it his favorite anime of all time. Banks also refers to himself as ""Femto"" from the Japanese manga, Berserk.
