"DJ Logic (born 1972 as Jason Kibler) is an American turntablist active primarily in nu-jazz/acid jazz and with jam bands.
",0,N/A
"Kibler was born and raised in The Bronx, NY. An early interest in hip hop led to him using the turntables, practicing often. Kibler was also interested in funk and jazz music and began collaborating with various musicians. His own recordings are perhaps best described as contemporary soul jazz with a strong hip hop feel.
",1,N/A
"Kibler tours often with his own group, Project Logic and has recorded or performed with Vernon Reid, moe., John Mayer, Medeski Martin & Wood, Bob Belden, Jack Johnson, Chris Whitley, Uri Caine, Christian McBride and others. On September 10 2001, Project Logic performed the final official show at Wetlands Preserve before the closing of the venue (this performance featured special guests Warren Haynes of The Allman Brothers Band and Gov't Mule, Stanley Jordan and Mike Gordon).  On April 6 2006, Kibler sat in with Bob Weir's Ratdog, adding his style to the famous Grateful Dead song combo ""China Cat Sunflower/I Know You Rider"". He is a founding member of The John Popper Project. On August 15 2009, Kibler sat in with O.A.R. at Madison Square Garden, adding his style to their latest single ""This Town"".
",2,N/A
"Jason Kiblers mentor was Vernon Reid, and the twosome recorded and toured occasionally as the “Yohimbe Brothers” with various guests. Kibler has appeared on studio and live performances with Reid's solo projects, Reid also did a guest solo on one track from Kiblers original band, Eye and I, which also featured D.K. Dyson and Melvin Gibbs, the latter of which has played on all of the DJ Logic solo releases as well.
