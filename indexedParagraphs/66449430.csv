"Anderson met future bandmate Aaron Kelley on Facebook around 2010 when he was fourteen-years-old. Remaining friends through 2014, Kelley introduced Anderson to recording industry executive Richard Reines, of whom he was interning for at the time, and Anderson began writing and producing for the bands that Reines managed.
