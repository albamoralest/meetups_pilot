"Once Vazquez-Cofresi decided to move the band to New York City, he had to hire new musicians and shorten the name to Los Calientes per the label's recommendations. After the September 11 attacks, the music scene in New York City was affected to the point that the label decided to invest in smaller acts that performed reggaetón. The band's album was shelved until 2004 when the contract ended with the label. Around the same year, Vazquez-Cofresi was working at ABC Television and playing music on the side. It was there that he would be introduced to lead-vocalist Edwin Perez (singer) who worked on a different floor for ESPN.
