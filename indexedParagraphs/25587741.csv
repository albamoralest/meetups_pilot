"He then joined Stereomud which consisted of Lowery on bass, Erik Rogers on vocals, Dan Richardson on drums, and John Fattoruso and Joey Zampella on guitars. They released their first album, Perfect Self, on Columbia Records in 2001 and a video for the song ""Pain"" received airplay on MTV2. They released Every Given Moment in April 2003. After participating in the JÃ¤germeister Music Tour with Hed PE, Breaking Benjamin, Systematic, 68rouge and Saliva, Columbia Records cut their touring support, and dropped the band. Due to this, and an impending Life of Agony reunion, Stereomud went their separate ways in July 2003, three months after the release of Every Given Moment.

"In 2015, Lowery was asked by Mike Mushok and Adam Gontier to join their new band, Saint Asonia.

The tour also included a stop in South Africa for Seether, after a six year absence. Before the tour ended, he became a full time member of the band.
