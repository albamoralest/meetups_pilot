"Headliner left Arrested Development in 1996 and did not participate in the group's reunion in 2000, unlike fellow ex-member Rasa Don, who returned to the band for another six years and, with whom he would eventually establish the 'Creative Royalty' production house. In 2015, Headliner allegedly took the liberty of releasing a song, ""Pension Plan (Clap Your Hands To This)"", under the name ""Arrested Development"" without prior consent from founding and existing member, Speech, claiming that he had every right to do so. Headliner also runs his own children's edutainment brand, the Sandtown All-Stars.
