"After beginning her career at the Blackstone Hotel in Omaha, she joined a United States Navy recruiting tour during World War II. In the late 1940s, she worked in clubs in Chicago where she once played piano for Anita O'Day. During this period, she became known for her singing, particularly for her renditions of torch songs. Southern signed a contract with Decca Records in 1951 and became known both for pop and jazz. She recorded ""When I Fall in Love"" accompanied by the song's composer, Victor Young, and his orchestra in April 1952. In 1955, her recording of ""An Occasional Man"" reached number 89 on the Billboard magazine pop chart.  She sang in films and in 1957 had a hit with ""Fire Down Below"".

"Her only child, Kathryn King, said Southern stopped performing because of its negative psychological effect. In a 2010 newspaper article, King talked about Southern's shyness, saying she had ""a paralyzing case of performance anxiety. Just contemplating performing made her enormously anxious and depressed.""
