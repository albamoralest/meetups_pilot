"The members of Trails and Ways met while attending UC Berkeley, and the band was formed in early 2012, after members had lived abroad in Brazil and Spain. Their songs have included Spanish and Portuguese, and their lyrics have been described as ""decidedly political"".  For example, their song ""Skeletons"" is about dancing at a club, then being ""fast-forwarded a thousand years to what was left of the club on an ecologically collapsed earth"".  In 2015, they signed on with Barsuk Records.
