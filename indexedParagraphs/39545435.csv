"Valerie Coleman was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, in the same West End inner city neighborhood that Muhammad Ali grew up in. Her father died when she was nine, and her mother raised Coleman and her sisters as a single working mother. Even as a toddler, it was clear that Valerie Coleman had a love for music and a great interest in playing the flute. Coleman even recollects picking up sticks in the backyard and pretending they were flutes. She started her formal music education in fourth grade, at age eleven. During her early years as a young musician, Coleman was interested in composing music. This love for composing grew and she started writing symphonies as a hobby, using a portable organ that she had at her home. By age fourteen she had written three full-length symphonies and won several local and state competitions, as well as participating as a flutist in youth orchestra. She is a graduate of Louisville Male High School.
",4,== Early life and education ==
"Coleman and all her sisters attended college, and she earned a double B.A. in theory/composition and flute performance from Boston University. She then graduated with a Masters Degree in flute performance from Mannes College of Music. Coleman studied flute with Julius Baker, Alan Weiss, Judith Mendenhall, Doriot Dwyer, and Mark Sparks, and composition with Martin Amlin and Randall Woolf.

",6,== Imani Winds ==
"In 1996, while still a student, Coleman began planning a chamber music ensemble. She chose the name Imani Winds, Imani being the Swahili word for faith, and sought African American woodwind players who might approach classical music from a similar cultural background. About her reasons for starting the ensemble:
",7,== Imani Winds ==
"I used to be in the youth orchestra [as a child], and there were so many African Americans. But somewhere along the line, when I got to college, I was the only one in the orchestra. So I wondered what in the world happened here? It came to my mind that role models are needed.
",8,== Imani Winds ==
"The group grew to five people, with Coleman on flute, Torin Spellman-Diaz on oboe, Monica Ellis on bassoon, Mariam Adam on clarinet, and Jeff Scott on french horn. From the beginning the ensemble focused on ""championing composers that were underrepresented from the non-European side of contemporary music."" The repertoire frequently involves music that is inspired by many different cultures including influences from the music of Africa, Latin America and North America. Accolades
",9,== Imani Winds ==
"By 2001 the group had won the Concert Artists Guild competition, and over the following years released five albums internationally on the E1 Music label (formerly known as Koch International Classics), with many of those tracks composed by Coleman herself. About their musicianship, the New Orleans Times Picayune stated, ""As an ensemble, the Imani Winds cultivate the big, rich sound one associates with classical players -- and they also display the daring, respond in-the moment qualities one associates with a swinging jazz combo.""The ensemble was named resident-artists of Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and has appeared in major concert halls throughout the United States. The ensemble has won awards from Artists International and the 2005 ASCAP/WQXR-FM Award for Adventurous Programming, and were honored at the 2007 ASCAP Concert Music Awards. NPR Music named their album Terra Incognita one of the ""5 Best American Contemporary Classical Albums Of 2010,"" saying ""Imani Winds' members have earned a reputation for expanding the recorded wind-quintet repertoire, but in a way that's culturally significant."" According to the Cleveland Classical, ""Imani Winds have carved a unique path into the world of classical chamber music for themselves through inventive programs, commissioning projects, and educational activities, and above all superb musicianship.""

"In 2009 Coleman conceived and created the Imani Winds Chamber Music Festival, which is both an institute and chamber music series on the Lincoln Center Campus in New York City. The festival attracts artists from all around the world, who come to be mentored by Imani Winds and explore different paths of chamber music performance and repertoire.

"The third annual festival was opened with Coleman's composition ""Tzigane,"" which according to Lucid Culture, ""made a deliciously high-octane opening number: an imaginative blend of gypsy jazz and indie classical with intricately shifting voices, it was a showcase for the entirety of the ensemble.""In 2012 composers were added to the roster through the Emerging Composers Program. It involved master classes with composers such as Mohammed Fairouz and Daniel Bernard Roumain, and the panel of guest artists included Stefon Harris, Paula Robison, Carol Wincenc, and Stanley Drucker.

"Coleman is the resident composer of Imani Winds, though the ensemble also incorporates the work of other members and composers. Coleman's style mixes modern orchestration with genres as diverse as jazz and Afro-Cuban. She has added a number of works to the flute repertory, also contributing to the literature for wind quintet, full orchestra, woodwinds, brass, and strings, many of which have been published by International Opus.
",17,== Compositions ==
"She often interposes music with the words of historical figures and poets, in some cases using manipulated speeches of people of diverse as Robert F. Kennedy, A. Philip Randolph and Cesar Chavez. About her world premiere of Painted Lady, a set of two songs for orchestra and soprano and her first commission, The Hartford Courant said ""The songs are luminous works, with a tangy but accessible harmonic language, graced with a humanizing sense of melodic line and a mildly exotic rhythmic lilt. They are the work of a major talent, and they should be recorded immediately."" The songs used words by African American poet Margaret Danner. Her signature wind quintet piece Umoja (named for the Swahili word for ""unity"") in 2002 was listed as one of the ""Top 101 Great American Works"" by Chamber Music America. Josephine Baker: A Life of le Jazz Hot in 2007 traced the life Josephine Baker, receiving a glowing response in publications such as the Philadelphia Inquirer.
