"Although active at the beginning of the decade, Yangpa began to experience health issues, causing her to go on hiatus. She released an album in 2007 titled The Windows of My Soul and collaborated with the singer Miho, but her activities were short lived and she once again went on a break.

"In early 2011, it was announced that Yangpa had signed onto Core Contents Media and would be making her comeback after her four-year absence. Her EP Elegy Nouveau, which contained the self-composed tracks ""Bon Appetit"" and ""그때 그 사람"", was released on March 28, 2011. After the concept photos for the album were released, controversy aroused over whether or not the singer had gotten cosmetic surgery. Her agency initially denied the claims, but Yangpa stated in a later interview that she had had some work done. Yangpa released the song ""Sarangeun da Geureongeoraeyo"" (Korean: 사랑은 다 그런거래요, ""Love Is All the Same"") featuring Davichi's Lee Haeri and F-ve Dolls member Han Na-Yeon (HANNA) on April 4, 2012, and announced that she would be releasing a new album titled Together. Shortly after the song's release, an alternative version of the song titled ""Ibyeoreun da Geureongeoraeyo"" (Korean: 이별은 다 그런거래요, ""Parting Is All the Same"") featuring Speed's Shin Jong Kook was released. On October 22, 2016, Yangpa participated in Immortal Song 2 and won that broadcast with 435 points.
