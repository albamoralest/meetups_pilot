"Andrew James Somers was born in Poulton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, England on Dec 31, 1942. (The birth date of Andy Summers -- aka Andrew James Somers aka Andrew James Summers -- is predominantly listed as December 31, 1942, on numerous online sites, including www.encyclopedia.com, www.britannica.com, www.imdb.com, and www.allmusic.com. The link in Citation #3 confirms this. Summers' age was also listed as 44 in the birthdays segment of the December 31, 1986, episode of Entertainment Tonight.)
",2,== Early life ==
"During his childhood, his family moved to Bournemouth, then in Hampshire,  (it was reassigned to Dorset in 1974). After several years of piano lessons, he took up the guitar. At an early age, he played jazz guitar. In his teens, he saw a concert by Thelonious Monk and Dizzy Gillespie in London that left a lasting impression. By sixteen he was playing in local clubs and by nineteen he had moved to London with his friend Zoot Money to form Zoot Money's Big Roll Band.

"Summers's professional career began in the mid-1960s in London as guitarist for the British rhythm and blues band Zoot Money's Big Roll Band, which eventually came under the influence of the psychedelic scene and evolved into the acid rock group Dantalian's Chariot. In September 1966, Summers was the first guitarist encountered by Jimi Hendrix after landing in the UK. The young Summers is portrayed in fiction as one of the ""two main love interests"" in Jenny Fabian and Johnny Byrne's 1969 book Groupie, in which he is given the pseudonym ""Davey"". After the demise of Dantalion's Chariot, Summers joined Soft Machine for three months and toured the United States. For a brief time in 1968, he was a member of the Animals, then known as Eric Burdon and the Animals, with whom he recorded one album, Love Is. The album features a recording of Traffic's ""Coloured Rain"", which includes a 4 minute and 15 second guitar solo by Summers. The LP also included a reworked version of Dantalion's Chariot's sole single ""Madman Running Through the Fields"".
",6,== Musical career == | === Pre-Police career ===
"After five years in Los Angeles, mostly spent studying classical guitar and composition in the music programme at California State University, Northridge, from which he graduated in 1972, he returned to London with his American girlfriend, Kate Lunken. In London, Summers recorded and toured with acts including Kevin Coyne, Jon Lord, Joan Armatrading, David Essex, Neil Sedaka and Kevin Ayers. In October 1975 he participated in an orchestral rendition of Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"".
",7,== Musical career == | === Pre-Police career ===
"In 1977, Summers was invited by ex-Gong bassist Mike Howlett to join his band Strontium 90, but was soon coaxed away by future Police bandmates Sting and Stewart Copeland.

",9,== Musical career == | === The Police ===
"Summers achieved international fame as the guitarist for the Police, which he joined in 1977, eventually replacing original guitarist Henry Padovani. Emerging from London's punk scene, the Police gained international renown with many hit songs, including ""Message in a Bottle"", ""Roxanne"", ""Don't Stand So Close to Me"", ""Every Breath You Take"", and ""Every Little Thing She Does is Magic"". During his time with the band, Summers twice won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, first in 1979 for ""Reggatta de Blanc"" (written with Copeland and Sting) and in 1980 for ""Behind My Camel"".
",10,== Musical career == | === The Police ===
"Although Sting was the lead singer of the band, Summers occasionally contributed lead vocals, as in ""Be My Girl/Sally"" (1978), ""Friends"" (1980), ""Mother"" (1983), and ""Someone to Talk To"" (1983). Other notable Summers compositions from this period are ""Omegaman"" (which would have been released as the debut single from the 1981 Ghost in the Machine album had Sting not objected), ""Shambelle"" (1981), ""Once Upon a Daydream"", and ""Murder by Numbers"" both co-written with Sting (both 1983). In early 1984, after seven years together and record sales around eighty million, the Police disbanded. Though not given songwriting credit, Summers wrote the guitar riff for ""Every Breath You Take"". It was recorded in one take with his 1961 Fender Stratocaster during the Synchronicity sessions. The song was number one for eight weeks. Sting won the 1983 Grammy Award for Song of the Year, and the Police won Best Pop Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal for this song. Summers provides an account of the session in his memoir, One Train Later. As a member of the Police, Summers created a trademark guitar sound, which relied heavily on a chorus effect. He explained in 2017 how the sound came about:
",11,== Musical career == | === The Police ===
"""I created it sort of out of necessity; my mission was 'We’re going to play for two hours each night as a trio,' so I wanted to have this fantastic, coloured guitar sound that was different for every song. So, I used the Echoplex, then a chorus, and a few other pedals…envelope filters. As we went on, I acquired more stuff and got a Pete Cornish board. But what was driving it was to invade and push the edge of what the guitar was supposed to sound like, and make it really interesting over a show. So, it wasn’t just one straight sound all the time. I could move it around. And it was appreciated by many millions of people (laughs). Of course, it’s very tired and a bit 'retro' now; I’m not very keen on it anymore. But in those days it was new, fresh, and exciting.""

"Summers's solo career has included recording, touring, composing for films (including Down and Out in Beverly Hills and Weekend at Bernie's), and exhibiting his photography in art galleries around the world.
",14,== Musical career == | === Post-Police ===
"He recorded the duet albums I Advance Masked (1982) and Bewitched (1984) with guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson, as well as duet albums with Victor Biglione, John Etheridge, and Benjamin Verdery. His solo debut album, XYZ, was released in 1987 and is the only non-instrumental album in his solo catalogue. Although it included pop material, such as the single ""Love is the Strangest Way"", it failed to dent the charts. In 1987 Sting invited Summers to perform on his second album ...Nothing Like the Sun, a favour the singer returned by playing bass on Charming Snakes (1990) and later contributing vocals to ""'Round Midnight"" on Summers' tribute album to Thelonious Monk, Green Chimneys, in 1999. In the mid-1990s Summers briefly returned to a more rock-oriented sound with Synesthesia (1995) and The Last Dance of Mr X (1997) before recording a string of jazz albums. He also participated very early in the formation of Animal Logic. In 1992 he led the house band (credited as Musical Director) for The Dennis Miller Show.

Their debut show was 25 July 2013 at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The band's debut album, Circus Hero, was released 25 March 2014. It is titled after a malapropism of the band's name made by a radio disc jockey during an interview of Summers.

"Summers was briefly married to American singer Robin Lane between 1969 and 1970. He married his second wife, Kate, in 1973 and they had one daughter in 1978, Layla Zoe Summers. Summers' years with The Police would take its toll on their marriage, however, leading them to divorce in 1981 although they would then re-marry in 1985. In 1987, Kate and Andy's twin sons Maurice X and Anton Y were born. As of 2019, Summers resides in the Los Angeles area with his wife and family.
