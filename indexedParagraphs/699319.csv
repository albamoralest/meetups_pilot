"A native of Berkeley, California, McCorkle studied Italian literature at University of California at Berkeley before dropping out to move to Europe. She was inspired to become a singer when she heard Billie Holiday sing ""I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues"". She began her career in the early 1970s by singing at pubs in London with bandleader John Chilton.  She also worked in London with Keith Ingham and Dick Sudhalter and recorded her first two albums, one a tribute to Harry Warren, the other to Johnny Mercer. After moving back to the U.S. in the 1970s, she sang at the Cookery in Greenwich Village and the Riverboat in Manhattan. Later in her career she sang often at the Algonquin Hotel. No More Blues (1989), her first album for Concord Jazz, was recorded with guitarists Emily Remler and Bucky Pizzarelli and pianist Dave Frishberg. Her writing was published in Cosmopolitan, Newsday, New York, and the O. Henry Award Prize Stories. Stereo Review magazine named How Do You Keep the Music Playing (1985) album of the year, while critic Leonard Feather named it vocal album of the year.
