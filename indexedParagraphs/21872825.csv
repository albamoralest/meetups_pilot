"Nahid's career began in 1970 when she sang a duet with Khalid Asghar in ""Raag Malhar"" at Radio Pakistan Multan. She has recorded songs in a range of styles, including Pakistani film music, pop, Ghazal, traditional Pakistani classical music, Punjabi folk songs, Qawwalis, Naat & Hamds & Others. She was first discovered for films by veteran music director M. Ashraf in the mid-1970s who pursued her to sing in films. She had no well-known person as ustad (teacher) to train her musically but music director M. Ashraf played a key role in grooming her talent. Her inaugural film ""Nanha Farishta"" was released in 1974 and in the same year she sang songs in film Shama (1974). Initially it was said in the film circles that she was introduced to fill the vacuum of Runa Laila who had migrated to Bangladesh. But later people realized that she had her own original singing style. She was active in the Pakistani film industry all the way through the 1980s.
