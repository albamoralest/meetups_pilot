"Taylor was a trombonist in the American Symphony Orchestra in the late 1960s under the direction of Leopold Stokowski and began playing as a studio musician during this time. In jazz, he worked with the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, Chuck Israels, George Russell, and Larry Elgart in the 1970s, and in the 1980s he worked with George Gruntz, Bob Mintzer, Ray Anderson, Jim Pugh, and Gil Evans. He began teaching at the Manhattan School of Music in 1989 and the Mannes School of Music in 1991. Taylor worked in the 1990s with Frank Lacy, Paul Smoker, John Clark, Daniel Schnyder, and Kenny Drew Jr.. He has also played in formal music idioms, including a 1984 recital at Carnegie Hall and with the Chamber Orchestra of New York and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.
