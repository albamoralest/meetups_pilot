"In 2003, Arista Records signed the band Lo Mass Republic, featuring Jason on guitar and Jesse Glick as lead singer, to a recording contract. Their debut album was recorded in Seattle by Rick Parashar (Pearl Jam, Temple of the Dog, Alice In Chains, and Blind Melon) and mixed by Jack Joseph Puig (Weezer, Stone Temple Pilots, The Black Eyed Peas, and U2) at Ocean Way but the record was never released.  The band then joined forces in 2007 and hired John Travis (Kid Rock, Juliana Theory, Social Distortion) to record and produce their independent album Poisoned Heart Machines. Since the early 1990s, he is also a regular member of Greyhound Soul (fronted by Joe Pena) which has achieved critical acclaim regionally. Jason has also performed and recorded with many other musicians, including Kathy Valentine (of the Go-Go's), Clem Burke (of Blondie), Abby Travis (of Elastica and KMFDM), Ian Astbury (of The Cult), Motochrist, Alana Sweetwater, Jet Set, and several others.
