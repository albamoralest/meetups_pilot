"Cohn was born in Chicago, Illinois. Cohn started playing in small groups around the city with King Fleming while he was still a teenager. Cohn joined Red Saunders' group in 1945, while Saunders was out of the Club DeLisa and working with a sextet instead of his usual mid-sized band.

"After his stint in the military, Cohn joined the Saunders group at the Capitol Lounge in Chicago; Leon Washington had recommended him. Cohn was featured on Saunders' first recordings as a leader, for Savoy, Sultan, and (behind Big Joe Turner) on National. Cohn was heard on the records that Saunders made for OKeh Records beginning in 1951 through 1953. After those records, Cohn was on Saunders' recordings for Parrot and Blue Lake in 1953 and 1954. Cohn survived several downsizings of the Red Saunders band, as well as the closure of the Club DeLisa, but eventually accepted an offer from Count Basie, with whom he worked from 1960 through 1984. After Basie's death, Cohn returned to Chicago, where he remained active as a musician for another two decades.
