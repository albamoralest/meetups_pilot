"Kasenetz-Katz discovered their latest hitmaking group, the Crazy Elephant (whom they consider the ultimate in underground acts) in a Welsh coal mine. As everyone can plainly see by looking at the charts, they rose to overnight fame. 'We come up on the elevator,' said the group's lead singer. Nevile Crisken, London nightclub owner, read an article in The Mining News, the country's leading underground newspaper, about a group of miners who hadn't been in the sun in four years.  Working in the lowermost depths of the mine, they spent their spare time playing in a rock and roll band. 'We had lots of rocks down there too,' grins the group's drummer.  McSteve hopped the first train to Wales, located the mine and descended 18,372,065 feet beneath the surface of the earth and signed the group to a long-term management pact.

"Former Cadillacs member Robert Spencer was widely utilized on lead vocals, though future 10cc member Kevin Godley took lead vocals on ""There Ain't No Umbopo"", recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, England, and released on the Bell label in May 1970.  A touring group was formed later for promotional purposes.  The bassist on ""Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'"" was Norman Marzano, part of the Marzano-Calvert studio group.  The song was covered by Detroit band Adrenalin featuring vocalist David Larson in 1979 and later by Helix.

Several follow-up singles, including ""Gimme Some More"" (b/w ""My Baby (Honey Pie)"") and ""Sunshine Red Wine"" (b/w ""Pam""), failed to chart.
