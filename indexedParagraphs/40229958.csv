At Vossajazz 2014, he appeared within the Polyostinat experience, by his brother Ivar Kolve. Together they performed within an elite team of Norwegian musicians, including Jørn Øien, Ellen Andrea Wang and last but not the least Jarle Vespestad. They delivered an indulgent poly rhythmic and poly harmonic treat for the discerning ear.
