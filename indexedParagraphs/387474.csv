"British newspaper The Guardian has described Heaton as ""one of our finest songwriters: his music reveals an exuberant ear for melody, his lyrics a keen eye and a brilliant wit"". AllMusic said: ""The warm, mellifluous voice of Paul Heaton often masks the jagged satirical content of his lyrics.""

"Paul David Heaton was born in Bromborough, Cheshire  on 9 May 1962 to parents Doris and Horace Heaton. Heaton has two older brothers Mark Heaton and Adrian Heaton. At the age of four his family relocated to Sheffield. While living in Sheffield, Heaton became interested in football, and while his elder brothers elected to watch Sheffield Wednesday, Heaton chose to support Sheffield United. After moving to Sheffield, Heaton's father took a job in management and Heaton described his childhood as being ""fairly middle class, although you wouldn't know it given the schools I went to and the friends I had"". After a childhood in Sheffield, Heaton moved to Chipstead, Surrey during his adolescent years, an early life Heaton described as ""bred in Sheffield, fed in Surrey"". Whilst in Surrey he, with his brother Adrian, formed their first band ""Tools Down"" with friends John Box and Stuart Mair. After leaving Surrey, Heaton spent time hitch-hiking around Europe before moving to Hull in 1983, where he formed the Housemartins. Heaton also lived in Leeds for a year. Throughout his childhood, Heaton's main interest was football, and he regularly attended Sheffield United games. Heaton played over 700 competitive games at junior and amateur level, often insisting on driving back from gigs on a Friday or Saturday night to attend his Saturday and Sunday matches.

"Heaton, then billing himself as P.d. Heaton, formed the Housemartins in the early 1980s. This band featured Stan Cullimore on guitar, Ted Key on bass and Hugh Whitaker on drums. Shortly afterwards Key left the band and was replaced with Norman Cook. The Housemartins released a number of singles and two studio albums, London 0 Hull 4 and The People Who Grinned Themselves to Death. Their most popular hit was an a cappella cover version of ""Caravan of Love"" (originally by Isley-Jasper-Isley), which reached number 1 on 16 December 1986, their only number 1 hit in the UK. For the second album Hugh Whitaker was replaced with Dave Hemingway on drums. Shortly afterwards the Housemartins split up.

"The Housemartins' lyrics were a mixture of Marxist politics and Christianity (the inner sleeve of London 0 Hull 4 contained the mantra ""Take Jesus – Take Marx – Take Hope"").

"In 1988, Heaton formed the Beautiful South. The initial lineup consisted of Heaton, Dave Rotheray on lead guitar, former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass, David Stead on drums and Housemartins former drummer Dave Hemingway, now in the role of joint lead singer and frontman. The writing partnership of Heaton and Rotheray proved very successful. The Beautiful South released two top ten singles, ""Song for Whoever"" and ""You Keep It All In""; the latter featured Irish singer Briana Corrigan on vocals. In 1989, the band released an album, Welcome to the Beautiful South. The band's biggest success to date is the single ""A Little Time"", released in 1990; it reached number 1 on the UK chart.
",8,== The Beautiful South ==
"The band went on to release eight more albums, including two (1996's Blue Is the Colour and 1998's Quench) that reached the number 1 on the UK Albums Chart, as well as releasing the best-of compilation Carry on up the Charts, which also reached number 1 and achieved platinum status, before the band split up in January 2007 (see below).
",9,== The Beautiful South ==
"After a band meeting on 30 January 2007, they decided to split. They released a statement on 31 January, in which their reasons for splitting were ""musical similarities"". ""The band would like to thank everyone for their 19 wonderful years in music,"" the statement also said. On an interview with BBC Breakfast in July 2008, Heaton clarified this statement by stating the Beautiful South had made similar-sounding albums for the past ten years.

"In 2001, Heaton released a solo album using the persona of Biscuit Boy (a.k.a. Crackerman). This double name, including the parenthetical a.k.a., was the official project name on all early releases.
",12,== Solo albums ==
"The solo album, called Fat Chance, was not a commercial success, peaking at number 95 for one week on the UK albums chart. Also, ""Mitch"", the lone single credited to Biscuit Boy (a.k.a. Crackerman), reached only number 75 in the UK Singles Chart.
",13,== Solo albums ==
"In an attempt to relaunch the album, Mercury Records re-issued Fat Chance in 2002. The album featured new artwork, and was now credited to Paul Heaton. However, this record charted even lower in the album chart, hitting number 168. ""The Perfect Couple"", a single pulled from this re-release also did poorly, peaking at number 102 in the UK. Heaton subsequently rejoined the Beautiful South from 2002 to 2007.

"In 2011, the Manchester International Festival endorsed the writing by Heaton of an anthology of songs based on the 7 deadly sins, to be called The 8th. The song was broken down into a section for each sin, which was to be performed by a different artist. The singers for the original piece were: Wayne Gidden, Aaron Wright, King Creosote, Simon Aldred, Cherry Ghost, Jacqui Abbott, Yvonne Shelton, and Mike Greaves. The individual sections were incorporated with a narration written by Che Walker and performed by Reg E. Cathey.

"On working with Abbott again, Heaton said: ""Working with Jacqui again was like going into your garage and discovering a beautiful, covered up Rolls Royce that hadn't been started in years. Jacqui is one of the best singers I've worked with and is also part of my past. It was only a matter of time before I asked her.""On Sunday 29 June 2014 they appeared live on BBC Two at Glastonbury Festival performing acoustic versions of second single ""Moulding of a Fool"" and a cover version of Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton's ""Islands in the Stream"".
