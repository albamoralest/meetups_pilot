"Bliss was founded in 1986 by vocalist Rachel Morrison and bassist Paul Ralphes, who were the primary songwriters. In 1987 they released two singles on the label Survival, ""I Hear You Call"" and ""Your Love Meant Everything"". Between March and September 1988 the quintet recorded their debut album, Loveprayer, which was released through Parlophone/EMI in 1989 and which also featured a number of session musicians. Loveprayer failed to make an impact in the U.S. and the UK, but saw success in Europe, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. By the time they recorded their sophomore effort, 1991's A Change in the Weather, Tommy Schmieder had taken over on guitar and Michael Witzel on drums. A Change in the Weather was produced by Rupert Hine and featured guest appearances from Paul Carrack and Liam O'Maonlai from Hothouse Flowers. Following this, the group toured with Van Morrison, Chris Isaak, and The Neville Brothers. Soon after the release of A Change in the Weather, Morrison left the group to care for a newborn child. Ralphes moved to Brazil to pursue a career in production.

Rachel and Tom then formed an electronica project called Meeker, which released several singles in 2000–2001.

"After meeting up again with original band member Paul Ralphes in winter 2006, the idea to re-form Bliss took shape and the German record label Zounds eventually released a ""Best Of"" album called Spirit Of Man including both previously published and new material, in 2007.  At the same time, the Bliss back-catalog of recordings done with EMI was digitally released internationally.

"Today, Bliss continue to perform with a new line-up consisting of Rachel Morrison (vocals), Tom E Morrison (guitars), Simon Peter (keyboards), Rob Tree (bass), Marc Layton-Bennett (drums/percussion).  This line-up, under the Rachel Morrison solo name, recorded an album of covers in the fashionable ""Celtic"" style released under the title ""The Celtic Woman"" which also includes three tracks by others.  The fifteen Morrison tracks range from versions of songs by Enya, The Cranberries and All About Eve to more ""standard"" covers of songs by Barbra Streisand, Dolly Parton and R.E.M.  The album has been released as one of a double CD set in 2008 called Simply Celtic Moods by Union Square Music (number SIMPLYCD009) and shows this singer's versatility to good effect.
