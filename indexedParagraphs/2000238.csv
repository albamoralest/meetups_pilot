"Prior to joining Journey, Tickner was a member of the San Francisco psychedelic rock band Frumious Bandersnatch, along with fellow Journey founder Ross Valory. In 1973, Tickner was in the lineup for a number of performances by Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders' band. After the release of Journey's debut album, he left the band to attend Stanford Medical School on a full scholarship. Upon Tickner's departure, Journey lead guitarist Neal Schon took over all of the band's guitar duties, until Jonathan Cain (keyboards/rhythm guitar) joined in 1981.
