She later signed them to Nick Raphael and Christian Tattersfield at Northwestside Records, a newly formed subsidiary of BMG. The band enjoyed multiple top 10 singles including the Number 1 ‘Freak Me’, as well as a platinum debut album in the UK. After Reid left the management business, Charrington joined up with Simon Fuller.

The duo have worked together for 14 years, 10 of which at Sony, before moving to Universal to restart London Records, now Capitol UK.
