"In 2005, Farren formed the indie rock band Fake Problems with local friends in Naples. The band would release 3 studio albums and several EPs before officially breaking up in 2014, following guitarist Casey Lee's departure from the band in 2012. In 2014, Farren began selling a The Smiths parody t-shirt that featured a photo of actor Will Smith, actress Jada Pinkett Smith, and their two children Jaden and Willow. Following an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, in which Fallon gifted Farren's shirt to Will Smith, the shirt became fairly popular online. After the dissolution of Fake Problems, Farren would go on to release a collaborative EP with Jeff Rosenstock titled Soulmate Stuff as the band Antarctigo Vespucci. Since 2014, Antarctigo Vespucci has released 2 full-length albums and 2 EPs. Farren released an album of all-original Christmas songs titled Like A Gift From God Or Whatever in 2014, with tracks featuring other artists such as Sean Bonnette, Laura Stevenson, and Mae Whitman. In 2016, Farren released his debut solo album, Can't Die, through SideOneDummy Records. In 2018 and again in 2020, Farren would compose music for two episodes of the Cartoon Network cartoon, Craig of the Creek with the show's composer and Farren's frequent collaborator, Jeff Rosenstock. His second solo album, Born Hot, was released on October 11, 2019 on Polyvinyl Records. In 2019, Farren announced The Born Hot Tour, his first headline tour as a solo musician. The tour began in January 2020 and concluded in February 2020 with a sold out concert in Los Angeles.
