"From 1983 to 2007 Shapiro recorded eight albums, toured, and frequently played tenor saxophone in New York City with the Microscopic Septet. In 1994 Shapiro co-founded a musical collective with American record producer Arthur Baker called Brooklyn Funk Essentials. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal's music critic Will Friedwald wrote that ""Shapiro's tenor saxophone sound itself is big, rich and full, and 'davens' in the direction of the great Italian tenors, like Vido Musso, Charlie Ventura and Sam Butera.""In 2020, Shapiro performed an homage to the Amazon Prime series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.
