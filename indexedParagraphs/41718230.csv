"Born in Osaka, Yamane attended the University of Arts in Aichi.  Her training destined her to be a violinist in classical music, but she extended her practice to modern music and later to pop music. She moved to Europe to further study in Berlin and Rostock, finally relocating in Berlin. In 2009 she started an experimental contemporary dance and live music project, Tansik, with dancer Chizu Kimura.  The group produced e.g. the plays ""~ing"" in 2012 and ""Discord"" in 2016.

"In 2011 she joined the band Tangerine Dream. In 2013 she started a solo project, Tukico, with a debut performance at Madame Claude, Berlin, in 2014.  She pairs up with Jürgen Heidemann in KiSeki (木石), producing experimental music with the sound of wood (木, wood of a violin, played by Yamane) and stones (石, stones, played by Heidemann). (""Kiseki"" is a pun on 奇跡 (kiseki) which means ""miracle"" in Japanese.) She often toured as a violinist with Jane Birkin and other Japanese musicians.  She composes and plays with the Berlin-based Motimaru Dance Company. In 2017 she performed on the Cargo original motion picture soundtrack composed by Thorsten Quaeschning of Tangerine Dream.
