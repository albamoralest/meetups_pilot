"Errico was born and grew up in San Francisco, California. He was a founding member and the original drummer, in December 1966, for Sly & The Family Stone, and in 1971 he became the first member to quit the group, citing the band's continuing turmoil. Errico toured with jazz-fusion group Weather Report in 1973/74, but never made a studio recording with the group. His performances can be heard on live recordings hosted at the website Wolfgang's Vault. Joe Zawinul said that no one could play his tune ""Boogie Woogie Waltz"" better than Errico had.

In 1974 he began drumming for the Jerry Garcia Band on and off thru 1984. He also worked with Larry Graham (from Sly & The Family Stone) plus members of the Tower of Power horns, Journey and the Pointer Sisters on the first album for Betty Davis; Errico produced and drummed. He also produced and drummed on the only album by Ike White (Changing Times).
