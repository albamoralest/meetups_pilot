"Maps of Tacit  Recorded with Andy Baker and Steve Albini.  ""Overall, Maps of Tacit finds Wright growing more adventurous both as a composer and performer; it's a dark and challenging work, yet it isn't off-putting or overly harrowing, and its bracing experimentalism and originality suggest even greater things to come."" – AllMusic review by Steve Huey. Perishable Goods was a limited mini-album compiled of appearances by: Alan Sparhawk of Low, Crooked Fingers, and Rachel Grimes and Christian Fredrickson from Rachel's.

"Over the Sun recorded with Steve Albini; although Wright had recorded with Albini before on several occasions (Maps of Tacit & Dyed in the Wool), this was the first time Wright and Albini completed a full-length record together. This album comes closest to capturing her raw live-performances.

"Division – 2017 album recorded in Paris and Rome at KML Studios with David Chalmin. ""Wright's songwriting reaches a new perfection in the most tenuous murmurs, where it is still a tear that works, an evil that clings, a fermenting poison. The nuances are all here: less guitar and more piano give the impression of chamber music – but flooded – or aquarium – but overturned. This frightened indecision, this trouble of the eyes too wide open, is the very art of Shannon Wright, very pure singer, too rare."" – Les Inrocks Paris, France
