"Javier Monthiel was born on April 11, 1967 in Ocotepeque, son of Antonio Leiva and Tereza de Jesús Ramirez. Javier inherited his musical aptitude from his father, who was a Honduran saxophonist and musician by profession. However, Javier did not meet his father until he was twelve years old and never spent much time with him. More influential in his life was his stepfather Valentín Pérez, a railway worker, whom Javier credits with having taught him honesty, humility and the value of hard work. Javier began to sing at the school, initially at Soledad Fernández Cruz and then at the Dionisio de Herrera institute in San Pedro Sula, where in 1984 he won the Summer Song Festival championship in Tela, Atlántida in 1984. After Javier finished school in 1985, he worked at the national telecommunications company, Hondutel. During this time he performed at the amateur level and matured as a composer. In 1990, Javier Monthiel also entered the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Honduras, where he obtained a degree in Business administration in 1998. In 1990 he also launched his professional career with the release of his first album produced in the Republic of El Salvador. This album included two original works, Tus Ojos Son and Culpables Rápido. These songs quickly became known within the romantic genre in Honduras.
