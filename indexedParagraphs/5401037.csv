"Until around 1999, KAORI. worked under the stage name Kawana Akiko (川菜明子) and then Kawana Midori (川菜翠) at an entertainment agency, but due to a merger with the agency she belonged to, she couldn't use ""Kawana Midori"" anymore, so she worked under the stage name Ka~na (か〜な) for a brief period. The stage name KAORI., which she used since 2000, is a portmanteau of Kawana Midori. In 2008, when she appeared in Pocket Monsters: Diamond and Pearl, she changed her stage name to Suzuki Kaori (鈴木カオリ), though she continued to use ""KAORI."" when singing.
