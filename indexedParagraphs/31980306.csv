"Fedorova was born in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR. Both her mother, Tatiana Abayeva, and father, Boris Fedorov, were concert musicians, scholars, and teachers. From the time she was two years old, she had always wanted to become a pianist. She began playing at the age of five. She gave her first public recital when she was six, and she gave her national debut at the age of seven, at the National Philharmonic Society of Ukraine. Regarding her early childhood, Fedorova has said that, with both parents being professional pianists, there was always ""the sound of the piano in the house"". Her parents gave her lessons, and she said ""they were decisive for my musical development"".

"Fedorova's ""international concert career took off while she was only a child"". In 2013, at the age of twenty-three, Anna performed at Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Netherlands. She played Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No 2. Fedorova has performed there more than thirty times. Fedorova's manager Rob Groen recounted the first time he heard her play. He ""reluctantly"" heard her play ""as part of a group of piano students performing for him in Kiev"". The first three were ""all very good"", but, when he heard Anna, he was ""in shock"" by her ""exceptional talent"". Musical critics have praised Fedorova's signature ""sweet modesty and wild expression"", which rendered listeners ""completely taken by surprise, compelled and astonished"". Fedorova says about her playing, ""You can really paint with music. You see the colorful, inspiring scenes.""

"The Nottingham Philharmonic Orchestra in a 2016 concert at Albert Hall in London. About the concert, William Ruff, music critic for the Nottingham Post wrote ""Soloist Anna Fedorova relished the work's sophistication and opportunities for bravura display. The opening movement exploded in a fireburst of energy and its castanet-accompanied march was handled with wittily pointed humour. Her characterisation of each of the slow movement's variations was sharply perceptive—and her high-octane handling of the finale was another display of pianistic fireworks.""

In his review in Fanfare on July 10, 2016, Colin Clarke wrote, ""The Chopin Sonata (with exposition repeat) reveals a player of the highest sensitivity... Fedorova has the daring to let bare textures speak for themselves; her rests are always impeccably timed and her approach reminds the listener of the modernity of Chopin's writing."" ""Brahms seems to enter a whole new world, a fantastical new beginning almost. Fedorova conveys all the exploratory wonder; the end is rapt and magnificent"". In the Liszt piece, Fedorova gives ""another fine performance"". She ""seems to enter straight into the world of the composer. Her way with the long tenor/bass melodies expertly tells a story; her filigree is impeccably Lisztian.""

"In the same issue of Fanfare, Peter J. Rabinowitz had a review. In it he said, ""Now just reaching her mid 20s, Ukrainian pianist Anna Fedorova shows herself, on this debut recital, to be a significant pianistic talent."" In the Chopin piece, she plays ""with a seamless legato, a rich and deep tone, a flexible (even improvisatory) sense of pulse, a sure feel for the emotional weight of the harmonies, and an enviable ability to sustain the phrases, she brings out the long lines in a way that's rare for hotshots of her generation"". ""She produces instead a polished elegance that helps explain why she did so well in the International Rubinstein In Memoriam competition in Poland in 2009."" In the Brahms piece, Fedorova's playing is ""even more succulent"". ""Her treatment of dynamics, especially at the quiet end, draws you in."" ""This is a distinguished reading—as is her rich and flexible reading of the Liszt Sonnetto.""In 2016, more albums by Fedorova were released on DRC: Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 3 and Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition were released. Piano Classics released an album of Fedorova playing Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, Cello Sonata accompanied by the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonic.
