"DeLong started as a drummer for indie rock bands but added more electronic elements to his compositions following his exposure to their use at raves. DeLong is notable for using video-game peripherals, such as a Wii remote and a joystick, connected to a MIDI interface, to modify his sound. He cites as influences Death Cab for Cutie, Modest Mouse, Dreamers, and Boards of Canada, among others. He released his first full-length album, Just Movement, on Glassnote Records on 5 February 2013.  His sound has been described by Wired Magazine as a merger of ""electronic dance music, alt rock, and vocals into tracks that are poppy enough to make you move but dissonant enough to be interesting."" At live performances, facepaint is offered to fans; volunteer local artists organized and led by DeLong's longtime partner, visual artist Heidi Callaway, do the actual facepainting. Facepaint is a regular fixture of DeLong's performances and creates a sense of community amongst fans.  His equipment and clothing feature an orange ""X"" logo; this same logo, or a variant of it, is often painted on his face and those in attendance.
