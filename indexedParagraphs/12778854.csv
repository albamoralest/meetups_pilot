"In 2012, he auditioned for the third season of the American music competition The Voice singing for his blind audition his own hit ""Cupid Shuffle"" in a varied version. None of the four judges Adam Levine, Cee Lo Green, Christina Aguilera or Blake Shelton pressed their ""I Want You"" button, thus eliminating him from further competition. But Cee Lo Green recognized Cupid after he finished the song and asked him to perform another tune to prove that ""he can sing"". After recognizing his true musical talent, the judges said that he should have tried a different song to help present his voice better.
