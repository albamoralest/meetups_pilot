"After National Service at Padgate, Warrington, England, Deuchar worked with the British modern jazz unit the Johnny Dankworth Seven. In the 1950s, he worked with a number of commercial bands, such as the Oscar Rabin Band, and also intermittently with Ronnie Scott. In the late 1950s, he worked with Kurt Edelhagen's orchestra in Germany. He returned to the UK and worked again with Scott (1960–62) and with Tubby Hayes (1962–66). As a highly gifted player and a leading exponent of the ""modern"" style, he was in some demand and achieved success as a touring player in Europe and the United States. He also ""sat in"" with leading American players at Ronnie Scott's club as musical exchanges were liberalised at the start of the 1960s.

"He returned to work with Edelhagen in 1966. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he also worked with The Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band, featuring leading European and expatriate American musicians. He returned to London around 1971, working freelance, and then to Dundee in the mid-1970s. He continued to arrange, play and guest in a number of settings, including the BBC Big Band in London and the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra in Glasgow, until his health deteriorated.
