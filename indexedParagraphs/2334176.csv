"Les McCann was born in Lexington, Kentucky, United States. He grew up in a musical family of four brother and three sisters with most of McCann's family singing in church choirs. His father was a fan of jazz music and his mother was known to hum opera around the house. As a youth, he played the tuba and drums and performed in his school's marching band. As a pianist McCann, was largely self taught. He explained he only received piano lessons for a few weeks as a six year old before his teacher died.

"During his service in the U.S. Navy, McCann won a singing contest which led to an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. After leaving the navy, McCann moved to California and played in his own trio. He refused an offer to work in Cannonball Adderley's band so he could dedicate himself to his own music. The trio's first job was at the Purple Onion in 1959 accompanying Gene McDaniels.McCann's main career began in the early 1960s when he recorded as a pianist with his trio for Pacific Jazz. In 1969, Atlantic released Swiss Movement, album recorded with saxophonist Eddie Harris and trumpeter Benny Bailey at that year's Montreux Jazz Festival. The album contained the song ""Compared to What"", and both the album and the single reached the Billboard pop charts. ""Compared to What"" criticized the Vietnam War. The song was written by Eugene McDaniels years earlier and recorded and released as a ballad by McCann in 1966 on his album, Les McCann Plays the Hits. Roberta Flack's version appeared as the opening track on her debut album First Take (1969).

"After the success of Swiss Movement, McCann, primarily a piano player, emphasized his vocals. He became an innovator in soul jazz, merging jazz with funk, soul, and world rhythms. He was among the first jazz musicians to include electric piano, clavinet, and synthesizer in his music.

"In 1971, he and Harris were part of a group of soul, R&B, and rock performers – including Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, Santana and Ike & Tina Turner – who flew to Accra, Ghana to perform a 14-hour concert for over 100,000 Ghanaians. The March 6 concert was recorded for the documentary film Soul to Soul. In 2004 the movie was released on DVD with an accompanying soundtrack album.
