"At the age of 16, Ledé moved to North Hollywood. She worked at a gymnastics center and a jazz club due to her receiving no advance from RCA Records.

She was later motivated by Grammy award-winning production duo Rice N' Peas to perform cover songs. The series was dubbed ""Soulfood Sessions"" and helped her gain a following.
