"Born in Petworth, Sussex, England, and later based in Folkestone, England, Landon started singing and playing semi-professionally under his real name of Pat Cahill in 1960, replacing Kitson 'Kit' Keen in the Dover based 'Rolling Stones' (no connection with the later famous band of that name). When he left to front the 'Cheetahs' (1961–62), he was replaced by Mick Morris (later of Mirkwood). After adopting the name Neil Landon, he joined Folkestone group the 'Burnettes' (1962–65), in which Noel Redding became lead guitarist and Pete Kircher, the drummer. In 1965 Landon released two singles, ""Waiting Here For Someone"" b/w ""I've Got Nothing To Lose"" (Decca F 12330) and ""I'm Your Puppet"" b/w ""I Still Love You"" (Decca F 12451).  Both were written and produced by John Carter and Ken Lewis. Despite television appearances however, early success eluded him.

"After replacing Ken Lewis in The Ivy League (Tony Burrows had replaced John Carter in 1966) Landon sang on a few of the group's less successful records. Subsequently both Landon and Burrows became members of The Flower Pot Men, who scored a hit in 1967 with ""Let's Go To San Francisco"" (Deram DM142) which reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1968, Landon began writing songs with former bandmate Redding, initially as a solo project but with the aim of involving other former bandmates as session musicians. Bassist Jim Leverton had connections with two of Landon's former bands having both played in the Burnettes as well as alongside the Rolling Stones. Since the demise of the Burnettes, Leverton had worked in the recording studio with the Walker Brothers and Cat Stevens among others, and had recently been playing as a member of Engelbert Humperdinck's backing band, where he had met the drummer Eric Dillon. With Leverton and Dillon now on board it was decided to turn the recording project into a new group and Fat Mattress was born. The new band toured the United States as support for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, securing a recording contract on their return to the UK and playing the Isle of Wight Festival 1969. Fat Mattress recorded two albums and a third was underway when they disbanded at the end of 1970. The band's first album yielded the major Dutch hit ""Magic Forest"", which Landon co-wrote and performed lead vocal on.

"After a spell in the U.S., Landon returned in 1972 to live in the UK where he put together a new band, 'Mainhorse Airline'. The group was short-lived however, and in 1974 Landon relocated to Hamburg, Germany where as 'Neil Landon and Friends', he quickly established a following. In September 1975 Landon's first German recording, a solo album produced by ex-Rattle Achim Reichel, was released. Two more albums, this time credited to the 'Neil Landon Band', followed as well as two more solo albums.

"Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Landon continued to be involved in a wide range of musical projects, including a 1982, Klaus Voormann produced single, ""One of the Big Boys""; stage appearances as lead singer with Klaus Gerlach's rock horror troupe; with the 'Neil Landon Five'; with Noel Redding at Hamburg's 'Fabrik' club in 1997; and in starring roles in the musicals, Let's Twist and Jailhouse in 1998 and 1999. In the spring of 2001 Landon's solo show, 'Musical Highlights', was a success with audiences, and in the summer of that year he appeared with his own new 'Neil Landon Band'.
