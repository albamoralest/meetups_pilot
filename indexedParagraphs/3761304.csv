"After a few years he returned to California, and began working as a sound engineer at RCA Records in Los Angeles.   During 1964 he served as ""audio consultant"" for the landmark concert film The T.A.M.I. Show.  He won a Grammy in 1964 for Best Engineered Recording - Special Or Novel Effects, for his work on The Chipmunks Sing the Beatles Hits. From November 1964 until August 1966 he was often the chief engineer for the Rolling Stones, primarily on the dates when they recorded at the RCA studios in Los Angeles, working on several albums and singles with the band during that period. Hassinger discovered, signed and managed the Electric Prunes, owning the rights to the band's name and engineering all of their recordings from their second single and first hit until their breakup in the early 1970s. Other musicians with whom he worked included Jefferson Airplane, the Mamas and the Papas, the Grateful Dead, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, the Monkees, Liverpool Five, Love, The Collectors, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, the Jackson 5, Leo Kottke, Seals and Crofts, the Blackbyrds, Sweetwater, and George Strait. The Doors' producer Paul Rothchild described Hassinger as ""a perfect example of a great engineer in a bad studio.... one of the great engineers in the world today... [T]hat Hassinger was able to go as far as he did with that studio [RCA] is a mark of his excellence as an engineer.""In 1969, Hassinger purchased the Moonglow Records building in Hollywood and renamed it the Sound Factory. The Sound Factory went on to become one of the most popular recording studios in Hollywood. He later worked for KPSI-FM radio in Palm Springs.
