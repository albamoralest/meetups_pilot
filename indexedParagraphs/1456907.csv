"Ozick's fiction and essays are often about Jewish American life, but she also writes about politics, history, and literary criticism. In addition, she has written and translated poetry. The Holocaust and its aftermath is also a dominant theme. Much of her work explores the disparaged self, the reconstruction of identity after immigration, trauma and movement from one class to another. Ozick says that writing is not a choice but ""a kind of hallucinatory madness. You will do it no matter what. You can't not do it."" She sees the ""freedom in the delectable sense of making things up"" as coexisting with the ""torment"" of writing.
