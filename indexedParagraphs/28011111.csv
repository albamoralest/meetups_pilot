"In 1992 he and fellow actor Son Ji-chang launched duo The Blue (더 블루). They were playing leads in hit dramas at the time, and enjoyed explosive popularity among women when they debuted with ballads and dance music. They went their separate ways for a while after their first album, but reunited in 1995 for a second project and produced many chart-toppers. Kim simultaneously launched a successful career as a solo singer. But in 1996, at the height of his popularity, As the controversy over the similarity of the song ""Gwi cheon do ae""(1996) to Japanese song ""Summer Dream""(1987, by Tube), he faced criticism and eventually announced his retirement. He made a comeback two years later with his fourth album. Though his popularity dimmed in the mid- to late-2000s, Kim remained active in the entertainment industry as an actor, appearing in the film Mr. Butterfly opposite Kim Jung-eun, as well as the romantic comedy/police procedural Woman of Matchless Beauty, Park Jung-geum, risqué cable drama Hyena, period drama The Return of Iljimae, and manhwa adaptation A Man Called God. In 2009 The Blue returned to the K-pop scene. Kim said Son had been toying with the idea of releasing a ""best of"" album for a while. When the two appeared together for an event in 2007, the positive response convinced them to get back together, so they re-recorded some of their old hits such as ""Feeling Only for You,"" ""With You,"" and ""Endless Love."" They released a four-song single album, and during that year went on official The Blue promotional activities. He and Son are also business partners and co-CEO of Blue M Company since 2010.
