"Bent Fabricius-Bjerre was born in Frederiksberg, Denmark. He started a jazz ensemble after World War II and founded a label, Metronome Records, in 1950. However, he is best known for his 1961 instrumental ""Omkring et flygel"" (literally, ""Around a Grand Piano"") which became a hit in Denmark. The song was re-released worldwide under the name ""Alley Cat"" on Atco Records the following year, and went to #1 in Australia and #49 in Germany. The tune also became a hit in the United States; the song hit #2 on the AC chart and #7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the LP of the same name hit #13 on the Billboard 200. ""Alley Cat"" also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock & Roll Recording. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. The follow-up single, ""Chicken Feed"", hit #63 in the U.S.
