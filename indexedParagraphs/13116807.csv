"Leslie Ann Jones has had an interest in music since her early childhood in the Los Angeles-area TV and music scene. Through her father she was exposed to a wide variety of musical styles. Through her mother, Helen Grayco (who sang with her father's band), she grew to appreciate fine vocalists such as Mel Torme, Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand. She was given a Sears Silvertone electric guitar and played in a band starting from when she was fourteen. She played Top 40 hits on guitar and sang background vocals with an all-female band; she arranged music for other people's bands and assembled a PA system. In 1974, Jones served as road manager and live sound mixer for Fanny on their world tour. Jones also made basement recordings for bands on an early Tascam ½"" 4-track tape machine. She wanted to be another Peter Asher and produce bands. Her favorite music is big band.

"In 1978, Jones moved north to San Francisco, California to work at The Automatt, a recording studio known for cutting-edge developments such as automation in mixing, an innovation followed quickly by the purchase of one of the earliest digital audio recording systems.

She also recorded albums by Maze, Confunkshun, Holly Near, and Angela Bofill.
