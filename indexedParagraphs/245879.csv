"Lew Brown (born Louis Brownstein, Russian: Луис Браунштейн; December 10, 1893 – February 5, 1958) was a lyricist for popular songs in the United States. During World War I and the Roaring Twenties, he wrote lyrics for several of the top Tin Pan Alley composers, especially Albert Von Tilzer. Brown was one third of a successful songwriting and music publishing team with Buddy DeSylva and Ray Henderson from 1925 until 1931. Brown also wrote or co-wrote many Broadway shows and Hollywood films. Among his most-popular songs are ""Button Up Your Overcoat"", ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"", ""Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries"", ""That Old Feeling"", and ""The Birth of the Blues"".

"Brown was born December 10, 1893, in Odessa, Russian Empire, part of today's Ukraine, the son of Etta (Hirsch) and Jacob Brownstein. His family was Jewish. When he was five, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School but, at the suggestion of a teacher, he left to pursue his songwriting career without graduating. Lew Brown was married first to Sylvia Fiske, then to Catherine ""June"" Brown until his death. He had two daughters from his first marriage, Naomi Brown Greif and Arlyne Brown Mulligan. The latter was married to the prominent jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan.

"Brown started writing for Tin Pan Alley in 1912 and collaborated with established composers, like Albert Von Tilzer.  Two of their well-known works that year were ""(I'm Going Back to) Kentucky Sue"" and ""I'm the Lonesomest Gal in Town"". Brown then wrote a string of popular World War I songs during 1914–1918, teaming with Von Tilzer, Al Harriman, and other composers. In 1925, Brown formed his most-successful songwriting partnership with Buddy DeSylva and Ray Henderson. Their cheerful hits, such as ""Button Up Your Overcoat"" and ""The Birth of the Blues"", earned lasting appreciation for ""the rich variety of verbal mosaics"" and ""the suggestive imagery that was their trademark"". DeSylva left in 1931 but Brown and Henderson continued scoring Broadway shows. Brown also worked with other composers, like Sammy Fain. ""Brown in 1939 estimated that he had written or collaborated on about 7,000 songs.""Brown wrote the lyrics to ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"" (1942), which appeared in the film Private Buckaroo.  Recordings by Glenn Miller and by the Andrews Sisters popularized the song with World War II soldiers and radio audiences.  Not long after this hit, Brown retired from songwriting.
