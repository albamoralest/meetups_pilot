"In 2008, Black released a solo single, ""HYPNTZ"". The song's lyrics were taken from rapper The Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Hypnotize"", while its instrumental sampled a cover of ""Starman"" by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Rihanna's ""Umbrella"". used. The single received positive reviews, with one critic commenting: ""It achieves its magic formula in a manner that is both arbitrary and obvious, which is a part of its brilliance. The Umbrella break + Starman soundtrack + a beautiful melodic rendering of a gangsta rap staple: we know exactly what has been done here, and this is why it sounds so good"". However, before a planned music video could be shot, The Notorious B.I.G.'s estate informed Black's team of their objection to the use of the ""Hypnotize"" lyrics. The ""HYPNTZ"" single was consequently taken out of circulation and the video scrapped.
