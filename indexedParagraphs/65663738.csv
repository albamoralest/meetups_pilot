"McCoy started his career as a backing vocalist and arranger for Anri's 1987 albums, Sumertime Farewells and Meditation, before being brought to serve as a backing vocalist for Carlos Toshiki & Omega Tribe's first album, Down Town Mystery. The band was composed of vocalist Carlos Toshiki, guitarist Shinji Takashima, and keyboardist Toshitsugu Nishihara, as their second guitarist and bandmaster, Mitsuya Kurokawa, left the band due to health issues.  After ""Aquamarine no Mama de Ite,"" Joey joined in the band officially with the release of the single ""Reiko,"" where he was the lead vocalist. After the break up of the group, he was featured on the 1991 album Perfect Selection Dracula by Konami Kukeiha Club, where he rapped on three of the songs. The year after, in 1992, he released his only album, Summer Time Memories, before disappearing from the scene altogether. He later moved to Hawaii. In the 2017 science fiction novel Honor's Reserve by Michael La Ronn, the character Grayson McCoy is named after Joey McCoy after finding out about the band from his uncle, who was a band manager. He stated that ""he brought up a crate from the basement, and on the very top I saw this CD–it was a Japanese band... and in the middle of four Japanese guys was a black guy. I was intrigued.""
