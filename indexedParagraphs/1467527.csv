"Dixon later played with April Wine and was lead singer of Guess Who for eight years in total, until his near-fatal car accident in 2008 in Australia. Coney Hatch bandmate, Curran spoke to Dixon via phone while Dixon was still in his coma, and told him Dixon had to live because Coney Hatch had more rocking to do. Dixon survived with multiple injuries and years in rehab. He tours solo and performs with his band and with former members of The Guess Who. He has released five solo albums. In 2016 he returned to The Guess Who for two sold-out shows in the USA. In 2017 Dixon released his debut country album ""Whole 'Nother Thing"". Dixon's survival from the automobile accident saw him become an inspirational speaker. He is listed with Canada's National Speaker's Bureau. In 2015 his first book was published by Dundurn Press titled A Strange Way to Live, and includes, among other things, his experience playing as part of Coney Hatch. Dixon has written instrumentals for television series including Tornado Hunters (Netflix), his songs have featured on Degrassi High, Baywatch (Taste of Love co-written with Brett Walker) and The Saddle Club television series.
