"In April 2004, Ambrosia Parsley embarked on a project for the liberal radio station Air America called Ambrosia Sings the News, providing a short song, usually under a minute or so, always with the same melody, that attempted to encapsulate the contents of the previous week's headlines.  Approximately 47-50 installments of ""Ambrosia Sings the News"" were aired, some of which she performed live.  The show was successful enough that a single entitled ""2004 (The Year In Review...For Anyone Who Can Bear the Mere Thought)"" was sold exclusively via iTunes.
