"Rothman was born and raised in a middle class area of St. Louis, Missouri. They are Jewish. From a young age, Rothman identified as gender-fluid, wearing makeup and presenting in an androgynous style. Rothman's mother was receptive, but their father pressured them into growing a beard and acting more masculine, which left them depressed and suicidal. Rothman was homeschooled until the fourth grade and was bullied after entering the public school system. From the age of 13, Rothman formed a number of punk, alternative rock and hip-hop bands, and toured throughout the United States. During this period, Rothman was physically assaulted by three off-duty National Guardsmen after performing a club in Texas. At 17, they left home and moved to Chicago with no support from their parents. Living with a cousin, Rothman encountered artists and musicians who helped them come to terms with their non-binary identity. From 2002 to 2011, Rothman fronted the punk rock band Living Things under the name Lillian Berlin.

In June 2013, Rothman released their debut single, ""Montauk Fling"", with an accompanying video directed by Sigismondi.

"In 2014, Rothman signed to Downtown Records and began work on their debut album, The Book of Law, with producer Justin Raisen. Rothman came up with a list of dream collaborators, including Duff McKagan from Guns N' Roses, Kim Gordon, Angel Olsen, and Nick Zinner from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, whom Raisen brought into their studio. The two used Rothman's journals as the basis for the lyrics and emotional mood of the record. In an interview with The FADER, Rothman stated that the recording process was fraught and dramatic, with “drug ODs [from others in the camp], fist fights, jail, police getting called on [Raisen] by record companies, threatening to cut a guy's neck off on Thanksgiving"".
