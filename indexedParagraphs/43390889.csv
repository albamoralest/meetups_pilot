The album, Echoes was initially announced for an August 2013 release. It was eventually released worldwide on November 12. The album debuted at number eight on the iTunes Electronic Chart. Commenting on the album, Flax said: ""It's amazing how it came together. It really was an organic process, which is truly important to us. The majority of the people on our record are friends, it really all came together perfectly."" Dillard adds: ""It took a while to finish since we had so many guest vocalists, but we're honored to have worked with so many talented artists."" Flax also said: ""We wrote it and produced it, so the final mixes had to be everything it could be. We wanted Chris Coady to mix our record, he had just finished Beach House, Zola Jesus, and Santigold and we loved the sound of those records. We had to wait for him and it was worth it"". Echoes combines house, trip hop, electronic, and gospel elements in some songs.
