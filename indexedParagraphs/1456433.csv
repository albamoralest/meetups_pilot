"Wilbur James Cobb (January 20, 1929 – May 24, 2020) was an American jazz drummer.  He was part of Miles Davis's First Great Sextet.  At the time of his death, he had been the band's last surviving member for nearly thirty years.  He was awarded an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship in 2009.

"Cobb was born in Washington, D.C. on January 20, 1929.  Before he began his music career, he listened to jazz albums and stayed awake into the late hours of the night in order to listen to Symphony Sid performing in New York City.  Cobb started his touring career in 1950 with the saxophonist Earl Bostic.  He subsequently performed with vocalist Dinah Washington, pianist Wynton Kelly, saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, bassist Keter Betts, Frank Wess, Leo Parker, and Charlie Rouse.  His website also recounts his gigs with Billie Holiday, Pearl Bailey, and Dizzy Gillespie that took place before 1957.

"== Career ==
",3,== Career ==
"Cobb joined Miles Davis in 1958 as part of the latter's First Great Sextet, after Adderley recommended him to Davis.  Cobb's best known recorded work is on Davis' Kind of Blue (1959).  Cobb was the last surviving player from the sessions, a distinction that, after Davis's death in 1991, he held for almost three decades.  He also played on other Davis albums, including Sketches of Spain (1960), Someday My Prince Will Come (1961), Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall (1962), In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete, and briefly on Porgy and Bess (1959) and Sorcerer.  His subtle and understated demeanor drew the admiration of many including Davis.  However, this also meant that he did not get the same level of recognition that his fellow drummers would.  Cobb had the propensity to eschew publicity and did not record his first set as bandleader until 1983, with the release of So Nobody Else Can Hear.
",4,== Career ==
"Cobb left the band in 1963, when Tony Williams was brought in by Davis.  He formed a trio with pianist Wynton Kelly and bassist Paul Chambers, both of whom were part of Davis' rhythm section.  The group recorded with Kenny Burrell (guitar) and J. J. Johnson (trombone), before breaking up at the end of the decade.  Cobb went on to join the Great Jazz Trio, together with Hank Jones on piano and Eddie Gómez on bass.  He also toured with Sarah Vaughan during the 1970s, and taught at Stanford University, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and Berklee College of Music.  He played in a tribute band called ""4 Generations of Miles"", together with Ron Carter (bass), Mike Stern (guitar), and George Coleman (tenor saxophone). During his career, Cobb worked with Bill Evans, Clark Terry, Stan Getz, John Coltrane, Wes Montgomery, Art Pepper, Wayne Shorter, Benny Golson, Gil Evans, Kenny Dorham, Frank Strozier, Bobby Timmons, Booker Little, Johnny Griffin, Akiko Tsuruga, Bertha Hope, Hamiet Bluiett, Nat Adderley, Mark Murphy, Jon Hendricks, Joe Henderson, Fathead Newman, Geri Allen, Larry Willis, Walter Booker, Red Garland, Richie Cole, Ernie Royal, Jerome Richardson, Jimmy Cleveland, Philly Joe Jones, Sonny Stitt, Nancy Wilson, Ricky Ford, Richard Wyands, John Webber, and Peter Bernstein, among many others.

"Cobb was married to Eleana Steinberg Cobb until his death.  Together, they had two daughters, Serena and Jaime, both of whom survived him. Cobb died on May 24, 2020, at his home in Manhattan.  He was 91 and had been suffering from lung cancer.
