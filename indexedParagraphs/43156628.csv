"Research trips to the interior of Argentina, Brazil and finally Uruguay, where he settled from 1950 onwards, allowed him to widen his continental vision.  This immersion into American cultural anthropology had influenced his music which, far from any superficial garment and in its apparent nakedness which may at times become disconcerting, is, according to the expressions of Colombian musicologist Andrés Pardo Tovar, ""a sign of a temperament which, notwithstanding its originality, finds in the roots of vernacular tradition the most profound and true sources of his musical aesthetics"".
