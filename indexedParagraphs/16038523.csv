"Ben Granfelt Band began working on their 11th album in February 2010 but Granfelt's family issues forced him to put both the album and the band on hiatus in June 2010. Soon after making this decision, Granfelt was asked to join Finnish Rock'n'roll sensation Los Bastardos Finlandeses by the band's lead singer Bryn Jones. It did not take too long for Granfelt to join Los Bastardos Finlandeses full-time and contribute to songwriting for their next album. Granfelt has achieved nidan (二段:にだん) second degree black belt in karate and black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
