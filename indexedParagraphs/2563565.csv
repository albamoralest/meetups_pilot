"His debut album Ginger (1993) was released on Richie Hawtin's Plus 8 record label in Canada, while in the UK it was part of Warp Records' Artificial Intelligence series of electronic listening music. A further, more introspective release, G-Spot, followed in 1995. A live album, !ive, was also released. Afterwards his work, which included Public Energy No.1 (1997) and A Shocking Hobby (2000) became more xperimental, importantly influencing the development of what is known as ""IDM"", or intelligent dance music.

"""Upon first impressions, Public Energy No.1 highlights a big departure from previous Speedy J offerings... in a complete role reversal, it enters upon an iconoclastic electro territory more familiar to admirers of such other purveyors as Autechre, the Aphex Twin, Mike Paradinas and Martin Damm in his Steel persona,"" wrote Andrez Bergen in 1998 for Australian magazine Inpress. The album Loudboxer (2002) saw a return to a more minimal four to the floor style of techno. While the CD version of the album contains 15 tracks mixed together, the vinyl version instead contains 200 locked grooves.
