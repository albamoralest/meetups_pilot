"Before joining Decapitated, Lechner played in symphonic black metal band Thorns of Ivy from 2006 to 2009. Lechner joined Decapitated starting after their hiatus from 2007 to 2009, replacing deceased former drummer Witold Kiełtyka. Lechner played in the band until leaving in September 2012, performing on the band's album Carnival Is Forever. In 2013, Lechner started an online fundraiser to fund his independently released solo album, titled Explore, released on 26 September 2013. Later in 2013, Lechner filled in on drums for Polish death metal band Behemoth, due to drummer Zbigniew Robert Promiński undergoing surgery. In December 2013, Lechner posted videos of himself playing the Slipknot songs ""People = Shit"" and ""Eyeless"" as an audition to be the band's next drummer, following the departure of Joey Jordison. However, his speculative application was eventually unsuccessful.
