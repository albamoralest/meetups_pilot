"In 1933, Abdel Wahab began composing his own style of Egyptian film musical after visiting Paris and familiarizing himself with French musical film. He introduced a lighthearted genre of musical film to Egyptian culture eventually composing eight musical comedies between 1933 and 1949. His films portrayed Western social elite and included music that veered off from the traditional Egyptian tune. He starred in his 1934 film The White Flower which broke records in attendance and still plays frequently in Egyptian theaters.

"Abdel Wahab composed more than 1820 songs. Abdel Wahab is considered to be one of the most innovative Egyptian musicians of all time, laying the foundation for a new era of Egyptian music with his use of non-local rhythms and refined oud playing.
",9,== Contribution to Egyptian and Arabic music ==
"Despite the fact that Abdel Wahab composed many songs and musical pieces of classical Arabic music, he was notably criticized for his orientation to Western music. In fact, he introduced Western rhythms to Egyptian songs in a way appropriate to the known then very classical forms of Egyptian songs. For example, in 1941, he introduced a waltz rhythm in his song ""El Gandol,"" and, in 1957, he introduced a rock and roll rhythm in Abdel Halim Hafez's song ""Ya Albi Ya Khali"".

"He composed some of the best hits of Nagat El Saghira, including four poems by Nizar Qabbani.

He was the first Egyptian singer to move from silent-era acting to singing. Abdel Wahab also composed songs for the Lebanese icon Fairuz whom he famously called ""Our Ambassador to the Stars"" and stated in the 1950s that he was the leader of her fan club in Cairo.
