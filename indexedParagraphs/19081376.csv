"She has been described by Tony Bennett as the ""Ella Fitzgerald of Brazil"" and others have compared her to the late Sarah Vaughan. In Europe where she toured, she was the Brazilian First Lady of Jazz, building a huge fan base in the Netherlands and Italy. She recorded the album Embraceable You in July 1991 at Volendam, the Netherlands. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote of Andrade's performance at Birdland on August 27, 2008, ""To describe Ms. Andrade as both the Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald of bossa nova only goes so far in evoking a performer whose voice seems to contain the body and soul of Brazil. You may think you know ""The Girl from Ipanema"", the final number in the show's opening medley of Jobim songs. But you haven't really absorbed it until you've heard Ms. Andrade sing it in Portuguese; disgorge might be a better word than sing, since, like everything else she performs, it seems to well up from the center of the earth.""
