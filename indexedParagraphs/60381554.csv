"Jones composed ""Easy Street"" in 1940. It was first recorded by 'Jimmy Lunceford and his Orchestra.'  Around four years later in Coney Island (during the summer of 1944), Jones collaborated with Lou Springer and composed the melody for ""Donâ€™t Go Away Any More, Elinore"" and ""Make the Two of Us One"" for Tom McKee, who wrote the lyrics.
