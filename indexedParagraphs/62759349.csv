While most Ikettes didn't last long, Jones was one of the constant members until the end of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in 1976. At one point, she had briefly quit when Ike Turner fined her $15 for being late onstage. Due to her experience and leadership, Jones trained the other Ikettes and was referred to as ""Motha"" Ikette.
