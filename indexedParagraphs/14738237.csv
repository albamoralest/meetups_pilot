"In 1969 Diermaier was a member of a German rock band called Campylognatus Citelli, with Hans Joachim Irmler (keyboards) and Arnulf Meifert (percussion). Later that year in Hamburg, at the suggestion of journalist and record producer Uwe Nettelbeck, they joined forces with another German rock group, Nukleus comprising Jean-Hervé Péron (bass guitar), Rudolf Sosna (guitar) and Gunther Wüsthoff (saxophone). The sextet became known as Faust and under the direction of Nettelbeck, they converted an old school-house near the village of Wümme, between Hamburg and Bremen into a studio, where they began working on their first album.
