"CooRie is a self-produced Japanese music unit by singer-songwriter Rino that performs songs for anime and games. CooRie used to be a two-person unit when it debuted in 2003, with Rino doing the lyrics and vocals and Naoyuki Osada (長田直之, Osada Naoyuki) doing the music compositions and arrangements. After Osada left by the end of 2003, Rino maintained the name CooRie and composed the music by herself, although she sometimes sings under her own name, especially if the song is for adult games. CooRie's records are released under Lantis and Mellow Head (On the Run).
