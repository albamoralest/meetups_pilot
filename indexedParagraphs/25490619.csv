"Raised by a family plugged into Pittsburgh’s jazz lineage, Dorsey began playing instruments at an early age. He picked up the piano and cello first, soon after joining the Pittsburgh Symphony at the famed Center for the Musically Talented. He began his undergraduate studies at Oberlin College, where he was the first to receive a B. M in classical Double Bass and Jazz Performance. Dorsey also graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory and was one of several jazz luminaries at the opening of their new jazz facility, the Bertram and Judith Kohl building. He released his debut album The Watcher in 1995 and followed it up with 1999’s Song of Songs. In 2003, he founded Leon Lee Dorsey Studios in New York City. Dorsey has performed alongside many jazz icons, from Lionel Hampton, Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers, Dizzy Gillespie, Wynton Marsalis, Freddie Hubbard, John Lewis, Kenny Clarke, Jon Hendricks, Gloria Lynn, Harry “Sweets” Edison, Dorothy Donegan, Stanley Turrentine, George Benson, Ellis Marsalis, Nnenna Freelon, Terumasa Hino to GRAMMY-winning vocalist Cassandra Wilson, performing with Frank Sinatra at Carnegie Hall, and with conducting legends Lukas Foss and Robert Fountain.
