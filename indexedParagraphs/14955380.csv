"Chrispa was born Chrisanthi-Pagona Pitiropoulou (Chris-pa) in Athens, Greece on 7 December 1982. At the age of five, she moved to Pireus, Greece where she began to experiment with music and dance. Originally, she had no dream to become a singer, and loved ballet. After thirteen years of ballet, she left it behind partly because of her short height, and pursued musical instruments, taking courses at her school for phonetics, piano and guitar. Chrispa's singing career began at age 18 when she sang a song with Sofia Vossou at her summer concert in Aegina. Vossou described Chrispa's voice as ""very good"" and her connections eventually helped Chrispa get a record contract with Alpha Records. Her talent was quickly realized and she sang in more concerts with other popular singers such as Stamatis Gonidis, Labis Livieratos, and Themis Adamantidis.

"She was a candidate in the Greek national final to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. Chrispa had chosen a song composed by Marios Psimopoulos with lyrics by Antonis Papas. The provisional title of the song was ""SOS For Love"", but later it was changed to ""A Chance to Love"". The song has an ethnic style, described as a ""Dance Oriental"", with lyrics in both Greek and English. At the national final, held on 27 February 2008, Chrispa performed ""A Chance to Love"" first out of the three participants. She placed third with 15.9% of the vote. Kostas Martakis placed second, and Kalomoira went to Eurovision with ""Secret Combination"", eventually placing third. On 6 October 2009, Chrispa released her fifth studio album, titled Mehri Edo. It included eleven new tracks composed by Stefanos Korkolis, with lyrics by Rebecca Roussi. It was reported that Chrispa had expressed dissatisfaction with her label's lack of promotion of the album, and as a result, considered prematurely exiting her contract with Minos EMI. Since that album, Chrispa has released four digital singles: ""Den yposxomai tipota"" (I can't make any promises) (2010), ""Eisai asteri"" (You're a star) (2011), ""Kolla 5"" (Hi5) (2012) and ""Me skotonei"" (It's killing me) (2013).
