"Dean joined Japan in 1975 at the age of 20. The band began as an alternative glam rock-style band and became a popular new wave sensation in the early 1980s. Dean left the band in May 1981 following their 'Art of Parties' tour, as his guitar work had become increasingly marginalised as they developed a more electronic sound.

"He had previously played on their albums Adolescent Sex (1978), Obscure Alternatives (1978) and Quiet Life (1979). His last studio contributions were on the Gentlemen Take Polaroids album, released in November 1980. Dean left the band just prior to them achieving mainstream success, which lasted until they finally disbanded in December 1982.

"Vivabeat (supported by Peter Gabriel) combined the influences of 70s British art-rock with the kind of lush technopop performed by David Bowie, Roxy Music and Sparks. The band was the first American band signed to Charisma Records. The band had a worldwide hit with the track ""Man From China"" from their debut album Party in the War Zone. Dean played on the follow-up single, ""The House is Burning (But There's No One Home)"", which was featured on the band's self-titled EP. The ""House is Burning"" song and video (also featuring Dean) appeared in Brian DePalma's movie Body Double. In 2001 a 'best of' Vivabeat album titled The Good Life was released, with Dean's work on several tracks.

"Little has been heard of Rob Dean as a musician since. The occasional demo tapes from the eighties have surfaced for a range of projects (known as 'The Lost Tapes') where Dean experimented with electronica (with Roger Mason), his trademark guitar sounds and even acoustic tracks with vocals.

"Dean's principal activity now is as a professional ornithology writer and artist on the birds of Central America. He lives in Monteverde, Costa Rica, and, now known as Robert Dean, has established a reputation as an expert on the region's birdlife. In 2007 Dean collaborated as illustrator on a field guide (along with author Richard Garrigues), entitled The Birds of Costa Rica: A Field Guide, and in 2010 (with author George Angehr) on The Birds of Panama: A Field Guide. He has been reported as occasionally playing guitar with local bands including Monteverde's rock band Chanchos de Monte, fronted by Alan Masters.

"More recently Robert has formed a group named 'Light of Day' with Isaac Moraga and their debut album Dimensions was completed in 2019 with UK/Europe/Latin America release expected in 2020.  In addition, a Spanish language e.p. featuring alternate versions of several album tracks is also being prepared for release in Costa Rica in 2020.
