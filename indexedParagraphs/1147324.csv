"Dundas was born in Oxford, the second son of Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Marquess of Zetland, and his wife Penelope Pike. As a younger son of a marquess, he is entitled to the courtesy title 'Lord'. He was educated at Harrow and the Central School of Speech and Drama. While at the Central School, Dundas shared a Camden Town house with actor Vivian MacKerrell and film director Bruce Robinson. The house on Albert Street had been bought by his parents for him to live in, eventually according to Dundas himself ""15 people were living there - there were three bedrooms"". Those years served as the basis for Robinson's unpublished memoir and the film Withnail & I (1987). Dundas co-wrote the score for the film, considered ""one of Britain's biggest cult films"". On 17 December 1971, Dundas married Corinna Maeve Wolfe Scott, and they had two children:

"His 1976 single ""Jeans On"" reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 17 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 in the German Singles Chart, where the song remained 19 weeks in the Top Ten. The song originally appeared as a television advertising jingle for Brutus Jeans (the words used in the jingle - ""I pull my Brutus jeans on"" - were replaced with ""I pull my old blue jeans on"" for the single release). The single was later sampled by Fatboy Slim for his track ""Sho Nuff"" which was also used in an advertisement in 2006 for SEAT Ibiza. Dundas's follow-up single, ""Another Funny Honeymoon"" was a medium-sized hit, reaching No. 29 in the UK. Dundas performed the song live on the BBC Television show, Top of the Pops, in 1977. A later single, ""Where Were You Today"", based on a C&A radio commercial (""Come and C and A"" being replaced by the song title) was less successful.
