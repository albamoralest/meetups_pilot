"Ian Broudie played in Liverpool's fledgling punk scene in the 1970s. He was a member of the band Big in Japan, which also featured Holly Johnson and Bill Drummond. He was also a founder member of John Peel favourites Original Mirrors in the early '80s, and was credited as a member of Bette Bright and the Illuminations on their lone album from 1981.  In 1983, he recorded and wrote tracks under the name Care with vocalist Paul Simpson; the duo released three singles, including the minor UK chart hit ""Flaming Sword"".

"Broudie began writing as The Lightning Seeds at the end of the 1980s, scoring a debut hit with the song ""Pure"". To begin with, The Lightning Seeds had just one member – Broudie himself.

"The Lightning Seeds produced a selection of well-received singles and albums in the 1990s. The albums Cloudcuckooland (1990) and Sense (1992) followed. The latter's song ""The Life of Riley"" became the backing music for Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition. In 1994 Broudie created a touring band so the songs could be played live. Their 1994 album Jollification is considered by many as the moment the Lightning Seeds arrived as a mainstream band. During the same period, Broudie produced albums for other acts, including Northside, The Primitives, Terry Hall and Dodgy. The Lightning Seeds twice took football anthem ""Three Lions"" (with comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel) to number one, with different lyrics for the Euro 96 and France '98 tournaments (Broudie himself is a supporter of Liverpool; Lightning Seeds album covers and inlays often contain references such as Justice for the 96 and Support the Liverpool Dockers). In the years since France '98, the song has been released multiple times for football tournaments, and now has the unique distinction of being the only song in existence to have become UK No. 1 four separate times with the same artists: two one-week stints in 1996, three straight weeks in 1998 for the remake, and again in 2018 for the original during the World Cup held in Russia. On 14 March 1997, Broudie was the guest host of Top of the Pops. Later that year, the Lightning Seeds headlined the Hillsborough Justice Concert, which was held at Liverpool's Anfield stadium to raise fund for the families in their struggle for justice.

"On 11 October 2004, Broudie released his debut solo effort, Tales Told, which was embraced by critics and fans alike – despite the fact that Tales Told saw Broudie move into folk rock territory and away from the slick pop sound of The Lightning Seeds. The first song on the album, ""Song for No One"", featured in the opening episode of the 3rd season of the US TV series The O.C.
