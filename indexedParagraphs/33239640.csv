"Harbour began piano lessons at 5 with the encouragement of his German paternal grandmother. Harbour's father had studied music and opera in Vanderbilt University’s Peabody College Of Education, Tennessee. At 16, Harbour was impressed by Edward Van Halen's performances and began bass guitar lessons. Harbour's prior lessons in classical and jazz piano assisted his guitar studies. Harbour studied funk, jazz and Motown bass lines. His desire to play the bass guitar came not only from his father but also from the music of Chris Squire from ""Yes"" and Geddy Lee from ""Rush"".

"In 1989, David T. Chastain, a guitarist invited Harbour to record bass parts on his instrumental solo album, Within The Heat. Harbour then joined Chastain's eponymous band, Chastain. In 1989, Harbour participated in the album, Shock Waves, a solo album by ""Chastain's"" vocalist, Leather Leone. In 1990, Harbour contributed to ""Chastain's"" album of classic heavy metal songs called For Those Who Dare. Harbour collaborated with David Chastain until the mid-1990s. Together, they recorded another two solo instrumental albums: Elegant Seduction (1991) and Next Planet Please (1994). These albums show a gradual departure from heavy metal music towards prog rock and fusion. While Harbour was a member, ""Chastain"" took three world tours.

"In June 1991, Chastain and Harris (who had played on the Leather album) collaborated to tour in the US and Mexico, record and release a concert album. Harbour recorded the rhythm section on Chastain's side and Greg Martin played drums on Harris' side. The resulting album, Live! Wild And Truly Diminished!!, was released in 1992. It contained concert versions of Harris' and Chastain's previous solo works and the concert improvisations of each. Harbour contributed to the album a solo bass guitar improvisation called B.O.F.. During the early 1990s, Harbour developed his pianistic skills and prepared his first solo album, with the working title, Lost For Words.

"""Chastain's"" former drummer, John Luke Hebert, invited Harbour to play with his band ""King Diamond"" in 1999, as the bass guitar position was vacant. After a personal conversation with the band members, Harbour joined the group without further question. In 2000, he contributed bass guitar accompaniment to the band's album House Of God recorded at the ""Nomad Recording Studio"". ""King Diamond"" took a self-titled tour after which Harbour left the band.

"In 2003, Harbour's solo album, Ideology was released on CD. Harbour composed music for the album, played piano and keyboard parts and bass guitar and took creative control, incorporating a number of different styles such as rock, jazz, prog rock, impressionism and new age. Influences evident in the album's music include George Winston, Tori Amos, Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush, Sting, and bands such as ""Pink Floyd"" and ""Rush"". Throughout the CD, the bass guitar contributes an independent melodic line in counterpoint to the piano, rather than just a simple rhythm accompaniment.

He is my 1 influence in all aspects of my bass playing, whether it's tapping, slapping and especially his aggressive dig-in style of fingerpicking. Back in the early '90s, I saw him play live six times when he would come to Detroit with neo-classical guitarist, David T. Chastain.""

He blew me away with all of his bass playing techniques, especially when he would tap during his solos. I saw him 5 times in the early '90s with Chastain, and corresponded a bit via email and phone calls since then. His aggressive, ""digging-in"" style is similar to mine, where you feel like you're physically connected to the instrument.""

You can imagine sometimes, if you got a guy that is really, really good he’ll try and play bass all over the place, but David has a very good ear for arrangement. If he just needs to play straight he will do that, he can hear what’s best for the song, and in different parts, go crazy when it's right. It’s another very big improvement.""
