"Marmontel was born in Clermont-Ferrand. He entered the Paris Conservatory in 1827. His teachers were Pierre Zimmerman in pianoforte, Victor Dourlen in harmony, Jacques Fromental Halévy in fugue and Jean-François Le Sueur in composition. He achieved a First Prize for his piano playing (1832). In 1837, he became professor of singing at the Conservatory, and in 1848 he also succeeded Zimmerman as professor of piano, beating his former teacher Charles-Valentin Alkan, and as a consequence derailing the latter's career. His memoir of Alkan in his book Les Pianistes célèbres is nonetheless one of the most valuable sources for Alkan's biography.

"Marmontel achieved renown as an effective and imaginative teacher. He had many pupils including Isaac Albéniz, Georges Bizet, Claude Debussy, Louis Diémer, Théodore Dubois, Dominique Ducharme, Gustave Gagnon, Ernest Guiraud, Vincent d'Indy, Albert Lavignac, Marguerite Long, Edward MacDowell, Zulema Garcia Olsen, Émile Paladilhe, Gabriel Pierné, Francis Planté, Paul Rougnon, Paul Wachs, Józef Wieniawski, André Wormser, and Antoine Simon.
