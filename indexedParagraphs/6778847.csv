"Sutton was born in Hamburg, Missouri, United States, the son of Earl and Edna Sutton. His younger sister Barbara Sutton Curtis was also a jazz pianist. Sutton had a stint as a session musician with Jack Teagarden's band, before joining the US Army during World War II. After the war, he played at various venues in Missouri, eventually ending up at Eddie Condon's club in Greenwich Village. In 1956, he relocated to San Francisco, California, where he recorded several albums with Bob Scobey's dixieland band. From the 1960s onward, he worked mostly on his own. However, when the World's Greatest Jazz Band was established in 1968, he was the natural choice for piano. He left that band in 1974 due to the extensive travel involved, and joined an old sidekick, Peanuts Hucko, in a quartet in Denver, near his home in Evergreen, Colorado.: 1–4, 133, 202 Fellow jazz pianist Jess Stacy said this about Ralph Sutton: ""He is a superb piano player and a great guy. There's nothing upstage about him. I really admire the way he plays. He's one of the few piano players who uses both hands, and it's sure nice to know that a player like Ralph is still around. I can't say enough good things about him. He's one of the greats, and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves."": 180 Sutton died of a stroke in Evergreen, Colorado at the age of 79.
