"Williams was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and moved to Oakland, California, before the age of 1. Learning to play the trumpet in elementary school fueled his interest in music; his skills as a vocalist were first nurtured by singing in gospel choirs and groups around the Bay Area. He worked with several notable artists, such as Sly Stone, Andra√© Crouch, Billy Preston and members of the Hawkins family, Edwin, Walter and Tramaine.

"After winning several local talent contests, Williams signed his first recording contract with Fantasy Records.  He cut two singles for the label, including ""Lisa's Gone"" and ""Feelin Blue"", written by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival. In 1972, Williams joined the emerging funk band Tower of Power.  A string of hits followed, including ""So Very Hard to Go"", ""What Is Hip"", ""Don't Change Horses (In The Middle of the Stream)"" and ""Willing To Learn"".  During his two years with the group, Williams participated in three albums: Back To Oakland, Urban Renewal and the gold LP Tower of Power.

"While still with Tower of Power, he recorded his first solo album Pray for the Lion for Warner Bros. Records in 1974. At the end of 1975, Williams left the band and returned to his solo projects.  Initially signing with Motown Records in 1975, he later moved to ABC Records in 1977 (which was then purchased by MCA Records in 1979).  With producer Frank Wilson at the helm and songwriters such as Judy Wieder, Clay Drayton, Terry McFadden, and John Footman, over the next four years, he scored ten chart hits, including ""Shoo Doo FuFu Ooh"", ""Choosing You"", ""You Got Me Running"", ""Love Hurt Me Love Healed Me"", ""Here's to the Lady,"" and ""Midnight Girl"". Williams recorded four more albums from 1977 to 1980: Choosing You, his first gold LP; Spark of Love (contains the hits ""You Got Me Running"", and ""Cause I Love You"" as well as ""Midnight Girl""); Love Current; ""Taking Chances"" and Let's Do It Today.

"After leaving MCA, Williams recorded for the independent record labels, Rockshire and Knobhill. In 1986, he was invited to sing vocals on ""Don't Make Me Wait For Love"", a track from Duotones, a multi-platinum recording by Kenny G. The song became a Top 20 Billboard Hot 100 and R&B hit the following year.
