"Born and raised in Lusaka, Zambia, Mutinta began rapping and producing music in FL Studio before moving to British Columbia, Canada at age 17 to attend university for computer science. After completing her degree she moved to Montreal, where she began performing at jam nights and released her debut extended play (EP) F.R.E.A.K.S. in 2018. She followed up later the same year with the EP Black Sailor Moon. Around the same time, she came out as transgender. God Has Nothing to Do with This Leave Him Out of It, her first full-length album, was released in May 2020. Her musical style blends hip hop with heavy metal and post-rock, including Black Sabbath samples and instrumental interludes influenced by Godspeed You! Black Emperor. However, the album featured numerous uncleared samples, which have forced its removal from online music stores and streaming services, meaning that it is now available solely as a free download from Backxwash's Bandcamp page. In June 2020, she was announced as part of the lineup of Saint-Jeanne, an LGBTQ-inclusive Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day livestream coordinated by singer-songwriter Safia Nolin, and including comedians Tranna Wintour and Karl Hardy, actress and writer Gabrielle Tremblay, songwriter and producer Annie Sama (Apigeon), and drag queens Kiara, Matante Alex and Gis√®le Lullaby. Backxwash's ""Don't Come To The Woods"" and ""Devil In A Moshpit"" appeared in Season 1, Episode 2 of the Showtime series, Work in Progress.
