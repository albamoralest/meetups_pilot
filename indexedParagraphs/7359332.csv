"Jeff Ballard was born 17 September 1963 in southern California but grew up and studied in Santa Cruz, California.  He began playing drums at the age of 14, attended Cabrillo College where he studied music theory, and toured with many bands, all the time absorbing influences and developing his own approach to drumming. He met Larry Grenadier in 1982, with whom he plays in both Fly and Brad Mehldau Trio. At the age of 24 he went on the road with Ray Charles for eight months every year 1988-1990 playing in Charles' Big Band. He moved to New York in 1990, where he started collaborating with Ben Monder, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Mark Turner and Ben Allison. Later on in New York he started to play with Avishai Cohen and Chick Corea. Ballard started the band Fly with Larry Grenadier and Mark Turner around the time Ballard was working with Corea. During a performance with Fly trio in New York city in 2005, pianist Brad Mehldau was invited to sit in, which led to Brad inviting Jeff to join his own trio subbing for Jorge Rossy, who for some time had been planning on moving back to Spain to focus on his piano playing. He formed the Jeff Ballard Trio with Lionel Loueke and Miguel Zenon, releasing Time’s Tales (Okeh) as the recording debut for Ballard as leader in 2014.
