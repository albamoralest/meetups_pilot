In 2014, he published the album Yeraltı Edebiyatı. He attracted attention with his street-like music compositions. In 2016, he released his second studio album Bir Gün Her Şey. He later recorded music videos for the songs ""Gece Sabahın"" and ""Memleketsiz"" in İzmir. His song ""Heyecanı Yok"" was featured on the soundtrack for the TV series Çukur.
