"Leo de Gar Kulka was born in 1921 in Brno, Czechoslovakia. After studying engineering, Kulka moved to Los Angeles in 1938. During World War II and Korean War, he served in the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Corps (CIC), retiring with the rank of major. Kulka's wartime experiences with wire recorders and radio transmission sparked a lifelong passion for recording and music. In the early 1950s he became a staff engineer at Radio Recorders at 6000 Santa Monica Blvd, Hollywood. Kulka was known by recording industry friends as ""The Baron"".

"In 1957 he founded International Sound, one of the first multitrack facilities in Hollywood. The studio, located on Sunset at Western, later became Sunwest. His Neumann mastering room was the first in the city to feature a stereo cutting head. At International Sound, Kulka recorded artists including Herb Alpert, Nat King Cole, Sam Cooke, Frank Sinatra, Sonny Bono and Little Richard. In 1964 Kulka moved to San Francisco and founded Golden State Recorders, one of the largest recording studios in northern California. With a Stephens 16-track recorder and a custom multitrack console, he contributed to the ""San Francisco Sound"", by recording artists Sly & The Family Stone, Grace Slick, Janis Joplin and Michael Bloomfield.

"During that period, Kulka was working for Autumn Records recording bands. Partnering with Sylvester Stewart, the leader of Sly & The Family Stone, Kulka arranged an early recording for the group, resulting in a single on the Lodestone label, ""I Ain't Got Nobody"" / ""I Can't Turn You Loose"". He and Stewart also collaborated on recordings by The Great Society for which both were the original session producers. For over 10 years Kulka lectured in Audio at San Francisco State University. In 1974 he founded the College for Recording Arts, dedicated to training aspiring music industry employees in all aspects of the industry. CRA is thought to be the first American school to provide unified business and technical education for the recording industry. Having attracted students from the North America, Asia and Latin America., some graduates of the school became successful engineers, producers and studio owners. In 1994 he closed the College for Recording Arts, instead devoting his time to analog and digital mastering, and the restoration of vintage sound recordings.
