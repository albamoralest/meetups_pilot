"Marc Kinchen (born August 3, 1972), known by his initials MK, is an American DJ, record producer and remixer. He hit number-one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1993 and 1994 with the songs ""Always"" and ""Love Changes"". Lead vocals on both of those tracks were performed by Alana Simon (songs were credited to MK featuring Alana). The combo also recorded the underground house music classic anthem ""Burning"". ""Always"" peaked at number 69 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1995. MK also hit the dance chart with ""4 You"", using the pseudonym 4th Measure Men.
