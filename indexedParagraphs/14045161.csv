"Born  in ZÃ¼rich, Antolini started playing the traditional Swiss Basler drum. In 1956 he went to Paris, where he played with Sidney Bechet, Bill Coleman.  He joined the Tremble Kids with trumpeter Oscar Klein and clarinettist Werner Keller. In 1962 he lived in Stuttgart, Germany, where he spent five years playing with bassist Peter Witte and pianist Horst Jankowski in the SWR Big Band led by Erwin Lehn. With Witte, between 1965 and 1967, he recorded five albums for the Romanian pianist Eugen Cicero, who combined classical music with jazz. He also played in big bands with Kurt Edelhagen, Peter Herbolzheimer, and Max Greger in the NDR Bigband.
