"While he can also be seen in Japanese television dramas, Fukuyama is best known for his singing career. His 1992 breakout single ""Good night"" gained a wide audience because of its tie-in with the TV drama Ai wo Douda.

Propelled by the success of Hitotsu Yane no Shita, in which he played Chinichan, the second older brother in the Kashiwagi family, he had his first million-selling single, ""It's Only Love/Sorry Baby"", in 1994. His 1995 single ""Hello"" became the second highest selling single that year.
