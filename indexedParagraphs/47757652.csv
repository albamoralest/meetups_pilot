"Kidd Kidd was discovered by American hip hop recording artist Lil Wayne, while rapping on a street corner in New Orleans. Kidd Kidd went on to sign a recording contract with Wayne's record label imprint, Young Money Entertainment. He joined the label as a member of Southern hip hop group Sqad Up, alongside fellow New Orleans-based rappers, Gudda Gudda and T-Streets. The group would ultimately disband and leave Young Money in 2004, due to disputes between members. Kidd Kidd would later rejoin the label and make an appearance on Lil Wayne's 2008 hit single ""Mrs. Officer"", however after not appearing in the video, Kidd Kidd severed ties with Wayne once again. In June 2011, two weeks after meeting New York City-based rapper 50 Cent, Kidd Kidd was shot six times. In July 2011, it was announced Kidd Kidd secured a recording contract with 50 Cent's G-Unit Records. 50 Cent empathized with Kidd Kidd's situation, reminiscent to his own shooting in 2000, and instead of walking away much like Columbia Records did to him, 50 Cent chose to help Kidd Kidd. He has gone on to appear on numerous 50 Cent's projects, such as The Big 10 (2011), The Lost Tape (2012) and 5 (Murder by Numbers) (2012). After being prominently featured on 50 Cent's fifth album Animal Ambition, which was released in June 2014, Kidd Kidd was added to the East Coast hip hop group named G-Unit.
