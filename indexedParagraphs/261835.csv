"Dudley was born in Beckenham, Kent. She graduated with a master's in music from King's College London in 1978. Trained as a classical performer, she moved into the competitive commercial field as a session musician, where her professional relationship with Trevor Horn began. In 1982, Dudley made significant contributions to the Horn-produced The Lexicon of Love album by ABC. She went from fleshing-out keyboard parts to scoring the album's orchestrations (which were, according to Horn, her first-ever string arrangements) and also co-writing some of the songs. In 2019, she conducted the Southbank Sinfonia during Martin Fry's Lexicon of Love tour. Dudley was a founding member of the successful band Art of Noise in 1983, which helped pioneer the use of sampling within the pop genre. Their stand-out hits include ""Beat Box"" (1984), ""Moments in Love"" (1985), ""Close (to the Edit)"" (1984), ""Paranoimia"" (1986), which featured a monologue about insomnia by the artificial intelligence character, Max Headroom (who fitted in well with the groups futuristic anonymity), and, with Tom Jones,  ""Kiss"", a Top 10 in 1988. Art of Noise also produced the theme tune to the ITV game show The Krypton Factor which was used between 1986 and 1993 and is arguably its most recognised theme. ""(Theme From) The Krypton Factor"" was composed and recorded in 1986 and was reworked as ""Crusoe"" on their 1987 album.

"Dudley's association with Trevor Horn and Art of Noise led on to working with artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal, Marc Almond, Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams and, more recently, Siphiwo. She has co-written songs with Malcolm McLaren (""Buffalo Gals""), Cathy Dennis (""Too Many Walls""), and a 1930s-inspired song with Sting called ""This Was Never Meant to Be"". She produced the Tom Jones hit ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" (1988) and a Debbie Harry single ""Strike Me Pink"" (1993).

"In 1989, Dudley produced and conducted the string arrangements for the eponymous debut album Waterfront by Welsh sophisti-pop duo, Waterfront. Her intricate production is demonstrated most notably on the song, ""Nature of Love"", which was released as a single in both the UK and US. Another collaboration in 1989 was  with Neil Tennant from Pet Shop Boys and Bernard Sumner of New Order; Dudley contributed the lush string arrangements on their debut Electronic release, ""Getting Away with It"", which peaked at #12 in the UK in  December 1989, and #38 in the US in 1990.

"Dudley produced two tracks on the 2002 Opera Babes album Beyond Imagination (ranking No. 1 on the UK classical charts for 11 weeks, and No. 4 on the US Billboard charts). In 2004, she produced the album Voice for Alison Moyet. The album, an eclectic collection of cover versions, reached No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart.

"Her works for orchestra include ""Northern Lights"", a 14-minute reflection of Norway's Aurora Borealis for full orchestra, performed in 2005 and 2006 at the Royal Festival Hall and broadcast on BBC Radio 3's Late Junction programme in May 2005. Her first commission as Composer in Association with the BBC Concert Orchestra was ""Music and Silence"", inspired by the novel of the same name by Rose Tremain and first performed at The Royal Festival Hall in 2002. Dudley arranged Bach's Chaconne from Partita in D minor for piano trio, and a recording by the Eroica Trio appears on their Baroque album. Her album Ancient and Modern, with modern versions of some traditional hymns and Bach chorales, was released in 1999. She was the musical director for Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra, first performed in Brighton then at the Royal Albert Hall in 2008, which was recorded and released as a DVD in December 2009. The show was toured in 2009 with eight different regional orchestras participating. It involved the orchestra playing the Nokia theme tune and a french horn concerto evolving into the theme from Coronation Street.
