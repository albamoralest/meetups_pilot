"He was lead trombonist with Clark Terry's Big Band and played bass trombone and tuba with Doc Severinsen's Band between 1968 and 1970. He joined Blood, Sweat, and Tears in 1970 after Jerry Hyman departed and first appeared on the album Blood, Sweat & Tears 4. With this group he recorded the jazz-rock solo on the tuba in ""And When I Die/One Room Country Shack"" on the album Live and Improvised (1975). His recording credits with BS&T include eleven albums. A break in their schedule allowed him to join the Gil Evans Orchestra in 1972.
