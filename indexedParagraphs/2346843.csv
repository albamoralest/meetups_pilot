"There has been much controversy over Maisky's playing. Part of the public criticizes his extensive and often extreme use of vibrato and his generally loud playing. Another part feels that Maisky thus maintains a romantic quality – even when interpreting baroque music – that cannot be found in many other players. A review by BBC Magazine writer Jan Smaczny stated ""Maisky's performance of these works could hardly be bettered. Strauss's Sonata has enormous youthful élan, and the arrangements of the Romance for cello and orchestra and ""Morgen"" are exquisite"" (Morgen! Opus 27, Number 4. 1894, Richard Strauss).
