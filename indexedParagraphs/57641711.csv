"Before he started a career in music, Listhrop began uploading videos on YouTube as Mazzi Maz. His personality on the site was described as a ""perky"" and ""super-smiley YouTuber"" who recorded and published vlogs in his bedroom. He often collaborated with friends and fellow YouTube personalities Sam Pepper and Caspar Lee. From late-2013 to mid-2014, Listhrop and Pepper embarked on a worldwide comedy-music tour, ""WDGAF Tour"". By February 2017, Listhrop removed all of his Mazzi Maz videos from his YouTube channel and has since rebranded it to his Scarlxrd moniker. In a 2018 Interview, Listhrop described his time as a YouTube personality and posting videos on the site as ""soul-destroying"".

"In 2014, Listhrop founded the nu metal/rap rock band Myth City, in which he performed as the vocalist. Listhrop also described the band's sound as a fusion of rap music and grindcore. The band's YouTube channel quickly gained a following mainly consisting of Mazzi Maz fans, who gave the group a mixed reception; fans responded positively to Listhrop's screamed vocals, but were confused on the contrast between the band's harsh musical style and Listhrop's ""smiley"" YouTube videos. Myth City released their self-titled debut EP on 28 February 2015.

"Scarlxrd's combination of trap music and heavy metal has been dubbed ""trap metal"", a style which multiple publications have described him as a pioneer of. He is often associated with SoundCloud rap artists. In a 2018 article, NME described him as a ""tormented outsider hip-hop artist"". They also called him a ""rap metal overlord"" and his style to include ""screamed vocals, claustrophobic trap beats and ear-shredding bursts of distorted guitar"", as well as calling it a fusion of metal and ""nihilistic rap"". Scarlxrd grew up listening to heavy metal music and cites hip hop artists including Missy Elliott, Nelly and Eminem as influences. He also stated that he formed Myth City after listening to Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, Incubus and Deftones. He is known to replace the letter ""o"" with ""x"", which is shown in his stage name and song titles. Scarlxrd's visual aesthetic within his music videos and clothing style is heavily influenced from Japanese culture, especially anime. His signature surgical mask, which he wears to distance himself from his YouTube image, was inspired by the Japanese manga Tokyo Ghoul. He began wearing the mask less often after the release of Infinity. Scarlxrd also cited American heavy metal band Slipknot as an inspiration towards his visuals.
