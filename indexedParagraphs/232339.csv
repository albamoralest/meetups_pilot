"Mantia was born February 4, 1963, in the South Bay city of Cupertino, California to an Italian-American father and a Japanese American mother. As a teenager, Mantia became interested in such artists as James Brown, Led Zeppelin, and Jimi Hendrix, acts that featured groove-heavy sounds. When he was 16 years old, he started playing drums. Because of his 'obsessive' study of the drum book Portraits in Rhythm, Mantia was given the nickname ""Brain"" by members of his high school concert band. Mantia attended the Percussion Institute of Technology in Hollywood, California during the mid-1980s to further hone his craft. During this time, he was a member of local funk-rock band named the Limbomaniacs (which would later become part of Ben Wa). In 1989, Mantia joined Primus briefly, before breaking his foot, forcing him to pull out of the band. In the early '90s, he joined Praxis, a musical project led by Bill Laswell featuring Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins and Mantia's long-time friend Buckethead. Mantia recorded with Buckethead on many of Buckethead's solo albums, including Monsters and Robots, Colma, The Cuckoo Clocks of Hell, and Bucketheadland 2, among others.

"Mantia appeared on releases by the industrial metal band Godflesh in the late 1990s, including Songs of Love and Hate, and Love and Hate in Dub. In 1996, Mantia rejoined Primus, touring with and recording for four years with the group, appearing on The Brown Album, Rhinoplasty and Antipop. In March 2000, Mantia joined the revamped lineup of Guns N' Roses after being recommended to singer Axl Rose by Buckethead (who himself had joined the band a few months earlier). In 2003, Mantia appeared on several songs on BT's 2003 release Emotional Technology as well BT's score for the 2003 film Monster. Mantia toured several legs of the Chinese Democracy Tour with Guns N' Roses from 2000 until 2006, when he left the band to take care of his newborn child. Frank Ferrer, originally brought in as just a replacement drummer for the tour, eventually replaced Mantia as full time drummer for the band. Chinese Democracy was released in 2008, and featured drums from Mantia on every track except the title track. Mantia was also credited with writing the songs ""Shackler's Revenge"" and ""Sorry"". Parts of Mantia's drumming on the album were note-for-note re-recordings of Josh Freese's parts, who left the band before Mantia joined. Mantia was also responsible for arrangements on ""Shackler's Revenge"", ""Better"", ""Street of Dreams"", ""There Was a Time"", ""Sorry"", ""Madagascar"", and ""Prostitute, initial production on ""Shackler's Revenge"" and ""Sorry"", engineering on ""Sorry"", drum machine and drum programming on ""I.R.S."" and Logic Pro engineering for the entire album.

"After leaving the band, Mantia made a guest appearance (alongside fellow former GNR member Robin Finck) at Guns N' Roses' House of Blues West Hollywood show on March 12, 2012. Mantia played congas on ""You're Crazy"" and ""Rocket Queen"". He continued to occasionally work for the band on yet to be released remix material. Since leaving Guns N' Roses, Mantia has primarily been focused on music behind the scenes as a composer and producer.
