"Karaduman was born 4 November 1987 in Samsun. Although he later enrolled in the conservatory to study music, he could not continue his education due to financial difficulties. After working in bars in Samsun for a while, he moved to Istanbul to pursue a career in music. While working in a bar in Kadıköy, Hande Yener's stage crew reached to him and offered him to join Yener's orchestra. He worked with Yener for many years. Afterwards, he composed or arranged the songs of various singers including Demet Akalın, İrem Derici, Emir, Bengü, Mustafa Ceceli, Murat Boz and Hadise, as well as various songs of Hande Yener. His first studio album Toz Duman was released by DMC on 12 June 2015. Separate music videos were shot for the songs ""İntikam"", ""Nerden Bilecekmiş"" and ""Kırk Yılda Bir Gibisin"" from the album. The songs were performed by Demet Akalın, İrem Derici and Murat Dalkılıç respectively. A breakthrough in his career came with the release of his first official single, ""Cevapsız Çınlama"", which featured vocals by Aleyna Tilki. In 2017, he was the victim of a knife attack in Eskişehir.
