"Jordan recorded numerous singles for Vocalion and Decca between 1930 and 1937, and also performed with some well-regarded bluesmen from the 1920s to the 1940s.  Jordan played with Peetie Wheatstraw, Roosevelt Sykes, Casey Bill Weldon and Memphis Minnie.

Later in that decade and into the 1940s, he worked frequently with Big Joe Williams.
