"Ayewa grew up in a public housing project in Aberdeen, Maryland, where she was born and raised. She relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to study photography at the Art Institute. In 2016, Moor Mother released a studio album, Fetish Bones, on Don Giovanni Records. The album, which was released alongside a 122-page book of poetry, was included on year-end lists by Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and The Wire. In 2017, she released a studio album, The Motionless Present, on The Vinyl Factory. It featured collaborations with Geng, DJ Haram, Mental Jewelry, and Rasheedah Phillips. The same year, she released a collaborative EP with Mental Jewelry, titled Crime Waves, on Don Giovanni Records. She served as one of the guest curators at the 2018 Le Guess Who? music festival. In 2019, she released Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes. Ayewa co-leads and provides lyrics and vocals for the ""liberation-oriented free-jazz collective"" Irreversible Entanglements. She met the quintet's members through musical and activist endeavors: bassist Luke Stewart shared bills with her band the Mighty Paradocs; saxophonist Keir Neuringer worked with Books Through Bars, whose events Ayewa has emceed; and the trio of Ayewa, Stewart, and Neuringer was followed by the duo of trumpeter Aquiles Navarro and drummer Tcheser Holmes at a 2015 Musicians Against Brutality event following the shooting of Akai Gurley. The group performed in the inaugural season of the Kennedy Center's ""Direct Current"" contemporary culture showcase, and their releases have been included in best-of lists in Magnet, NPR Music, The Quietus, and Stereogum's ""20 Best Jazz Albums Of The 2010s"". The band's instrumentalists also performed on Ayewa's debut theatrical work, Circuit City. From Fall 2021, Ayewa serves as assistant professor at the University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music.
