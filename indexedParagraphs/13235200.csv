"Phillips graduated from Fremont High School in Fremont, Nebraska, in 1953 and attended the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, during the summer of 1954. After high school, he played trumpet in the Dick Mango Orchestra and the Verne Byers Orchestra. While touring with the latter, he met Pat Thompson, a trombonist with whom he became lifelong friends. While touring with Byers, he arranged songs, including ""Pennies from Heaven"".
",4,== Career ==
"In 1955, Phillips and Thompson moved to New York City and shared an apartment. Bill Evans lived in the basement apartment. While waiting to get his union card, a six-month period, Phillips substituted in the bands of Les Elgart, Woody Herman, Dan Terry, Leon Merian, and Jimmy Dorsey. In 1960, he and his wife Carol moved to Las Vegas, joining Thompson. He spent the rest of his life in Las Vegas. He played in several show bands and worked for many years in the house band at the Flamingo Las Vegas.
",5,== Career ==
"He belonged to the Las Vegas Hilton house band from 1970 to 1983. Although his colleagues often saw him writing arrangements during breaks, as seen in the documentary film of Elvis Presley's first appearance at the Hilton, he usually refused composer work while working there and concentrated on his house band performances. In 1973, he became close friends with James Moody while Moody worked at the Hilton. He also performed with the David Rose Orchestra.
",6,== Career ==
"Several factors compelled Phillips to leave the Hilton. The Hilton management changed the showroom format by bringing in a production show, the type of show that, if it were a hit, would require a musician to play the same music for years. Phillips was disinclined. Around 1975, he injured his lip, which developed into a lump that wouldn't heal. He took lessons to rebuild his embouchure but worried that if he continued to play he would permanently damage his lip.

"Verne Byers felt that the music industry (from the perspective of musicians) fell apart in Las Vegas in 1983. According to Byers, the big band era was in decline and casinos were switching from live bands to recorded music, which resulted in a musicians' strike in 1989.
