"In October 2018, Lazić had a severe traffic accident, due to driving under influence 100 km per hour and not having his seatbelt on. Although committing several traffic offences, he didn't face any legal consequences. Same year, a video of Lazić consuming cocaine surfaced to the public, which led to him admitting to have had drug addictions.
