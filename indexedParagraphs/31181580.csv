"In 1999 Joel Savoy co-founded the Red Stick Ramblers from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 2006 he started the annual Faquetaigue Courir de Mardi Gras as an alternative to the main Eunice courir event. The run has become one of the most musically based versions of the traditional event. Also in 2006 he founded Valcour Records, an independent record label based in Eunice, Louisiana, with friends Phillip LaFargue II and Lucius Fontenot. Valcour Records' first release was Goin' Down to Louisiana (2006) by fiddle player Cedric Watson and accordionist Corey Ledet. During the 2007 Cajun French Music Association's Le Cajun ceremony at Lafayette's Blackham Coliseum, Joel Savoy garnered the ""2007 Fiddler of the Year"" award. In 2008 he played on, recorded and produced his mother's album If Dreams Come True at his Studio Savoy Faire. His brother Wilson and several members of the Red Stick Ramblers also played on the album of Django Reinhardt-style blues and jazz standards as ""Ann Savoy and her Sleepless Knights"". Joel Savoy had played and performed with his ex-wife and fellow fiddler, Kelli Jones.  The couple released a four-song EP in 2018.
