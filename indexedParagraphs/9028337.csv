"In March 2010 Clufetos quit Rob Zombie to join Ozzy Osbourne. ""I have no problem with [Ozzy], nor with Tommy joining his band,"" said Zombie. ""My beef was the way Tommy did it. If he'd come to me and said he wanted to leave, I'd have said that was fine and wished him all the best. He didn't.""

"In May 2012, Clufetos played with Black Sabbath, filling in for original drummer Bill Ward. However, he did not perform on their album 13, as Brad Wilk ended up behind the kit during the sessions.

Clufetos continued with Sabbath in 2014 with the first show at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and the final show at Hyde Park, London.
