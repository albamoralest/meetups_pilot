"Martone was born in Beamsville, Ontario. Dave began learning guitar at the age of 6. His father, who is also a guitarist, taught him Classical guitar and then had a teacher from Spain (Gary Santucci) teach him Classical and Flamenco. After taking lessons with Santucci, and discovering heavy metal music, he learned in his parent's basement with cassette tapes, guitar magazines, and self-instructions books. The first rock song he had learned by ear was ""War Pigs"" by Black Sabbath from their greatest hits record. He obtained a recording engineering diploma from Fanshawe College in Ontario in 1990, and graduated from the Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Massachusetts, where he studied with Jon Finn, Joe Stump, Jim Kelly and Bruce Bartlett, with a performance major in 1995. Popular guitar players who have inspired and influenced him to play guitar are Angus Young, Gary Moore, Tony MacAlpine, Tony Iommi and Edward Van Halen.
