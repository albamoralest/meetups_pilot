"Finn is most notable for his third-person narrative lyrical style, wherein he frequently makes reference to literature, pop culture, adolescence, partying, religion and drugs. Both with Lifter Puller and The Hold Steady, Finn's songs often follow a storytelling format that features recurring characters and locations, with Ybor City, Fla., and the Twin Cities having special prominence.
",27,== Lyrical style ==
"Particularly in later Hold Steady albums, Finn's songs have explored the darker aspects of his characters' party-centric lifestyles. Finn told an interviewer in 2012: ""Artistically, I have always been really interested in the hangover; not just the celebration and the confetti but also the puke in the gutter."" Finn has said that ""irony is certainly not something I want to be accused of,"" instead hoping to bring ""honesty and sincerity"" through his songwriting. Although his stories involve violence and heavy drug use, Finn states his songwriting is not very personal or ""confessional"". Finn's lyrics have been a frequent point of praise for The Hold Steady with Uncut Magazine describing his style as ""narratives driven less by the wordy exposition of yore than acute observation, devastating detail, by turns exclamatory, epigrammatic and grainily authentic.""

In an interview with GQ, Finn discussed his love for Danko: ""People roll their eyes about his solo records, but I'm just happy to have more songs that I can listen to him sing; his voice is incredible...I would listen to him sing the phone book.""He is also a fan of Drive-By Truckers.
