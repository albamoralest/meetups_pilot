"He was born in Somerville, Tennessee, the son of Cordellia Henderson and Plez Williamson Rivers, who were both musicians. The year of his birth is uncertain. He stated that he was born in 1905, 1910, or 1914, while his union records give 1924. Little is known about his early life. He developed a self-taught style of slide guitar through playing at local dances in his teens. He claimed to have played with Yank Rachell, Sleepy John Estes, Blind Boy Fuller, Sonny Boy Williamson II  and Big Joe Williams, among others, and to have been acquainted with Robert Johnson. He also claimed to be the older cousin of Elmore James, to have bought James his first guitar, and to have taught him how to play slide. However, some of these claims are unconfirmed.

"In 1932 he relocated to Chicago, Illinois, working with Horace Henderson's band at the Circle Inn and with the pianist Jimmy Walker at the Square Deal Club. He may have first recorded for RCA Victor in 1937, but this is also unconfirmed, and by 1938 may have begun playing electric guitar. His first known recordings were in 1952 for Chance Records, recording the tracks ""Lonesome Ole Train"" and ""Homesick"", which gave him his stage name. During the late 1940s and 1950s he worked with Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice Miller), and with Elmore James, and in the early 1950s he worked in bands including Baby Face Leroy Foster, Snooky Pryor, Floyd Jones, and Lazy Bill Lucas. He was a member of Elmore James's band from 1955 to 1963, contributing to such tracks as ""Dust My Broom,"" ""The Sky Is Crying,"" and ""Roll and Tumble."" Elmore James is said to have died on Homesick's couch, while the latter frantically searched for the former's heart pills. As a solo performer, he recorded for the Colt and USA labels in 1962, including a cover version of Robert Johnson's ""Crossroads"". His slide guitar style, not as refined as Elmore James's, traces back to Johnson's. He also recorded a 1964 album for Prestige Records, Blues on the South Side (Prestige OBCCD 529-2), including another of his best-known covers, ""Stones in My Passway"", and some tracks for Vanguard, which are available on the compilation album Chicago: The Blues Today. During the 1970s, Homesick was reintroduced to European audiences through his participation in the 1973 and 1975 editions of the American Blues Legends tours and albums organised by Big Bear Records, also recording a solo album Home Sweet Homesick James and a duo album with Snooky Pryor for the UK-based label. One of his own songs, ""Gotta Move"" (also on Blues on the South Side) was covered (as ""Got to Move"") by Elmore James and by Fleetwood Mac. He is mentioned by name in the 1989 song ""Fergus Sings the Blues"" by the Scottish rock band Deacon Blue, with the lyric ""Homesick James, my biggest influence"". Homesick James had a nickname of ""Look Quick"" due to his propensity for moving or disappearing off a scene seemingly on the spur of the moment. From 1972 through 2006, Homesick lived in Chicago, Nashville, Atlanta, Fresno and finally Springfield, Missouri, where he died at age 96.
