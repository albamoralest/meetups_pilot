"Tucker joined the Athens, Georgia-based Drive-By Truckers in 2003, replacing original bassist Earl Hicks. Tucker had previously played upright bass on the Truckers' album Decoration Day. She played bass on their next two records, The Dirty South and A Blessing and a Curse, before contributing her first songs on 2008's Brighter Than Creation's Dark. She wrote three songs on that record: ""I'm Sorry, Huston"", ""Home Field Advantage"", and ""The Purgatory Line"". She also joined the band backing up Booker T. Jones on his record Potato Hole and Bettye LaVette on her record The Scene of the Crime. For most of her career in the band, she was married to guitarist Jason Isbell, though the two eventually divorced. She also performed on Isbell's first solo album Sirens of the Ditch.
