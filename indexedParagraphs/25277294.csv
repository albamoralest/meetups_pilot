"Aspheim was a member of Norway's first trad jazz band 'Dixie Serenaders' from 1949 to 1952, of 'Big Chief Jazzband' from 1952 to 1978 and then initiated his own orchestra Aspheim Oldtimers in 1979. They appeared at several jazz festivals in Norway and Germany and toured extensively in Europe. The orchestra has seven album releases. He also ran and developed the family business 'Aspheim Flygel- og Pianosenter', which he acquired in 1954 and developed into one of Scandinavia's largest grand piano and piano companies. Aspheim was the eldest and a natural leader type. People thought he was the ""Big Chief"", and he was the obvious chairman of ""The Big Chief Jazz Club"" in the basement of Majorstuhuset (1953–65). His lectures on jazz history, which often spanned to 1930, was legendary. He also promoted the annual 'Norwegian Championship for amateur jazz band' (1954–1964), the Journal ""Jazz Society"" (1957–59), ""Kunstnerkroa"" (1957–60) and the legendary ""Metropol Jazz Center"" in Akersgata (1960–65). In addition, he held several positions in the Norwegian Jazz Federation in the first five years after it was founded (1953). He received an honorary award at the 2004 Oslo Jazzfestival.

"Aspheim inherited the family business ""Aspheim’s Flygel og Pianosenter"" in 1954. After finishing his education at Schimmel Pianofortefabrik, Braunschweig, West Germany, in 1957, he developed the company through 1960-80'es to become one of the largest piano firms in Scandinavia. Especially the close ties to the Schimmel family in Braunschweig was important for this process. Aspheim worked at the firm until he died in 2009.
