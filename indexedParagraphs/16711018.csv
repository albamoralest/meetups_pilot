"Sophie & Magaly was a French musical duo composed of twin sisters Sophie (24 August 1964 – 27 February 2019) and Magaly Gilles (24 August 1964 – 2 April 1996). The duo are best known for representing Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 with the song ""Papa Pingouin"", placing ninth. However, the song was a commercial success in France, where over one million copies of the single were sold. Their second single, ""Arlequin"", sold poorly, and their German producer Ralph Siegel of the label Ariola dropped them from the label shortly thereafter. Producer Charles Talar subsequently gave them a second chance, however, their follow-up singles ""Toi"" and ""Les nanas de Zorro"" were equally unsuccessful, and the group disbanded shortly thereafter.
