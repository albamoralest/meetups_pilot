"Eustis formed Telefon Tel Aviv with high school friend Charles Cooper in 1999. The duo released their debut album, Fahrenheit Fair Enough, in 2001 through Hefty Records. This was followed by Map of What Is Effortless in 2004 and Immolate Yourself in 2009. On January 22, 2009, Charles Cooper died, leaving the future of Telefon Tel Aviv uncertain. In 2011, Eustis co-produced Puscifer's second studio album, Conditions of My Parole. He also contributed to Puscifer's Donkey Punch the Night EP and All Re-Mixed Up remix album in 2013. In 2013, it was announced that Eustis would perform as a live member of Nine Inch Nails for the Tension 2013 tour. He mainly took the bass duties during the early tour, due to bassist Eric Avery's departure from the band. After bassist Pino Palladino's inclusion to the new line-up, he performed mainly on keyboards and different instruments accompanying key moments in some of the songs, such as the saxophone and erhu. In December 2013, it was announced that Eustis would not be performing with the band on the following 2014 tour. In 2014, Eustis announced that he would release a full-length solo debut as Sons of Magdalene, a moniker adopted in 2007, when his father was diagnosed with cancer. The album, titled Move to Pain, was partially recorded before Cooper's death and was released on June 24, 2014, through Audraglint Recordings. Starting from the beginning of 2015, Eustis became an active member of The Black Queen, along with Greg Puciato and Steven Alexander.
