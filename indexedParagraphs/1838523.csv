"Wader was born in Bethel, near Bielefeld, Westphalia, Germany. His works are mostly based on German Folk songs. Aside from his own lyrics, he also performs works of famous poets like Eichendorff. He now rarely sings the workers' songs and socialist hymns that used to be a large part of his repertoire. In 1997 he published an album exclusively with songs by Franz Schubert. He also performed translated works from Carl Michael Bellman on the album Liebe, Schnaps & Tod.
",2,== Life and work ==
"In the 1970s, Hannes Wader became one of the stars of the political left through his provocative songs. He was a member of the German Communist Party from 1977 to 1991. Wader even came under suspicions of terrorism because of his song Der Tankerkönig, a spoken song about kidnapping a tycoon.
",3,== Life and work ==
"In 1973, he moved to Struckum, in Nordfriesland, where he published some of his later albums. In 1998, he and his family moved to the Steinburg district of Schleswig-Holstein. He now lives in Kassel. He has published numerous albums and appeared in open-air concerts and clubs until 2017. His last concert was on 30 November 2017, in Berlin.
