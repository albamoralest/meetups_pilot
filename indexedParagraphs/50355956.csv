"Born in Stuttgart, West Germany, James is of Panamanian and African-American descent. Throughout his childhood, James would sing regularly, but never in public. He eventually moved to New York where he was influenced by his aunt Rosie Gaines, a former singer for Prince. His love for the album Purple Rain landed him in a studio at the age of 19. His skills as a songwriter began with the song ""Portrait"", leading up to a credit on the single ""Use Me"" by R&B singer Miguel after forming a bond with him on MySpace. James performed in and around New York with artists such as Luke James and Wynter Gordon. In 2013 he released his first EP, a three-part entitled Coke, Jack and Cadillacs. Each part represented important themes in his life - first love, first drink, first car. The EP featured songs that included ""A.D.I.D.A.S."" and ""Pledge Allegiance"". It also featured Asher Roth on the song ""Lisa"". James signed with ByStorm Entertainment/RCA Records in 2015 and subsequently released ""Permission"", his first single from a major record label, reaching number 37 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. His debut album, Eldorado was released May 27, 2016. It debuted at number 71 on the US Billboard 200 and at number eight on the US Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. It subsequently earned him his first nomination for Best R&B Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017.
