"Clemens is the older brother of Carach Angren's former drummer Ivo ""Namtar"" Wijers. He first started playing piano at the age of 7 and played with a local youth choir throughout his teen years. He grew interested in metal in his secondary school years and joined a band as a way of combining his new interest with his classical background. He also studied music at the Tilburg Conservatory in 2002 before forming Vaultage in 2003, and later co-forming Carach Angren. He has also completed a certificate in Cinematic Orchestration, taught by William Boston. Wijers has mentioned that he is a fan of orchestral soundtracks from films and video games, and that he was a big gamer in the 1990s who loved video game soundtracks.
