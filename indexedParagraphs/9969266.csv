"Yarritu's only credited role in the production of How to Be a ... Zillionaire! was providing spoken passages on some tracks. He and Eden (Fiona Russell Powell) were hired for ABC's Zillionaire! era mainly for their unconventional look onstage and in videos. In Yarritu's case, it was his short stature, shaven head, oversized eyeglasses, and diminutive build. He was the lone American in the band.
