"Mann was born in Madras, India, the son of Gerald and Joyce Mann. He was educated at the Dragon School and Winchester, after which he took lessons in London, studying the piano with Ilona Kabos and composition with Mátyás Seiber. He was at Magdalene College, Cambridge from 1946 to 1948, studying with the composers Patrick Hadley and Robin Orr and the organist Hubert Middleton. On leaving Cambridge in 1948 Mann joined The Times in London. In the same year he married Erika Charlotte Emilie Sohler, with whom he had four daughters. He remained at The Times for 34 years, first as assistant music critic (1948–60) and then as chief music critic (1960–82). Although the paper in the post-war decades was generally conservative and traditional, Mann was, as a colleague described him, ""markedly progressive, even iconoclastic, in outlook."" In 1958 Mann contributed the libretto to Franz Reizenstein's Let's Fake an Opera, produced for the 1958 Hoffnung Music Festival. It consisted of ""ridiculously juxtaposed excerpts from more than forty operas, which delighted both Reizenstein and the audience"". Mann was one of the first music critics to see serious artistic value in rock music. He achieved some notoriety for his assertion that the Beatles were ""the greatest songwriters since Schubert"". Most unusually for a serious music critic, he appeared as a panellist on the television pop music programme ""Juke Box Jury"". As a broadcaster, however, he was better known as a regular contributor to the BBC Third Programme (later BBC Radio 3). He contributed reviews to The Gramophone for many years. In 1985 Mann was director of the Bath Festival in succession to Sir William Glock. Mann died in Bath at the age of 65. As of 2013, Mann's surviving compositions (all in manuscript) are held at Cambridge University Library. Many are signed 'Bo Mann', as 'Bo' was the name by which he was known to his family and closest friends.
