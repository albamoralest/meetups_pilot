"Jerrold ""Jerry"" Samuels (born May 3, 1938) is an American singer, songwriter and record producer. Under the pseudonym Napoleon XIV, he achieved one-hit wonder status with the Top 5 hit novelty song ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"" in 1966. Samuels has occasionally revisited the Napoleon XIV character to record other songs, usually comedy records with an insanity theme.

",3,== Biography ==
"In 1966, Samuels concocted ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!"" while working at Associated Recording Studios in New York. The public found out his true identity when Cousin Brucie of WABC outed him. The record quickly climbed the charts, reaching the Top Ten nationally in just its third week on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 3 and sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In the Cash Box Top 100 the record even climbed to No. 1 for one week in its second week on the charts.
",4,== Biography ==
"The success of the single inspired a Warner Bros. album of the same name in 1966 (reissued by Rhino in 1985), most of which continued with the mental illness theme (for example: ""Bats In My Belfry"" and ""Split Level Head"" which features different vocal parts in each stereo speaker). A second single of two recordings from that album was relatively unnoticed. His manager was Leonard Stogel.
