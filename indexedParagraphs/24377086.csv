"In January 2010, Brown announced that he is starting a record label with Corgan. This record label was to be called Startone Records and the roster includes The Electric Prunes, The Strawberry Alarm Clock, YaHoWha 13, Starchildren and Fancy Space People. However, the status of their collaboration for the label is unclear as it was announced that Brown and Corgan will no longer be working together as of December 2011. Brown continues to run Starry Records, having released the debut Fancy Space People 12"" EP, and in the fall of 2011, released Not Long For This World, by Bauhaus legend David J.
