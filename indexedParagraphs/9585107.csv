"Beginning in 1897 she did a great deal of research on Russian music, making many visits to Russia and working at the Imperial Public Library of Saint Petersburg under the supervision of Vladimir Stassov.  She became one of the first English critics to champion Russian music.  After 1915 she performed a similar service for Slovak music.

"From 1907 she edited the Living Masters of Music book series for John Lane. From 1908 until 1920 she wrote program notes for the New Queen's Hall Orchestra, and for Prom concerts.  From 1919 she was assisted in respect of new works to the repertoire by Eric Blom, then in the early stages of his writing career.  Newmarch's existing notes for established works continued to appear in the programs.  Newmarch and Blom continued to write in tandem until 1927, when the BBC took over the concerts.
