Tresvant grew up enjoying music with his younger siblings, sister LaTonya and brother Andre. When some junior high school friends got the idea to put a group together, Tresvant and three others – Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivins – started performing at local talent shows. They were spotted by a local up-and-coming producer and songwriter, Brooke Payne, a local manager and choreographer, who encountered the boys at a local talent show in Roxbury.

"Quiet and shy, Tresvant was initially apprehensive about the idea of recording a solo project. Tresvant felt as if the members of the group were not showing him the acknowledgment that he thought he deserved.

His self-titled debut was released in 1990. The lead single ""Sensitivity"" spent 20 weeks on the U.S. R&B Singles chart, including two weeks at Number One. The album also included the Top 5 hit singles ""Do What I Gotta Do"" and ""Stone Cold Gentleman"", the latter of which features guest vocals from former band member Bobby Brown. Tresvant's self-titled debut album sold two million copies, achieving double-platinum status.
