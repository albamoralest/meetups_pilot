"Zebra Face is a cartoon character created by Kid Acne and Supreme Vagabond Craftsman. He is a bombastic stripey horse with a hip-hop obsession and an insulin dependent sidekick. Zebra Face first appeared in a one-page comic strip in Kid Acne's 'Velcro Grass' fanzine in 1995. Generating mild interest amongst the UK fanzine scene at the time, Zebra Face then became a fanzine of his own before the duo began working on a book, which was self-published in 2001.

"Zebra Face was made into a short animated series for Channel 4, broadcast in Autumn 2012.
