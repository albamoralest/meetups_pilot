"Joy Lynn White (born July 24, 1961) is an American country music singer-songwriter. White was born in Arkansas but raised in Mishawaka, Indiana. Signed to Columbia Records in 1992, she released her debut album Between Midnight & Hindsight that same year. In 1993, she was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the Academy of Country Music Awards, but lost to Michelle Wright. A critical favorite, reviewer Alanna Nash once described White as ""a fiery redhead with a wild-and-wounded delivery and an attitude that says sheâ€™s not to be ignored."" The Dixie Chicks covered both ""Cold Day in July"" from White's first album and ""Tonight the Heartache's on Me"" from her Wild Love album.
