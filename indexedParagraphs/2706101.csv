"In 1961, Simjanović was among the forming members of the beat band Siluete, in which he played the keyboards. In 1963, he moved to the band Elipse. With Elipse Simjanović achieved nationwide popularity, with the band's live performances and releases being praised by the press. Yugoslav media promoted rivalry between Elipse and Siluete, comparing it to the one between The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. Elipse initially performed beat and rhythm and blues, and in 1968, with the arrival of African vocalist Edi Dekeng, added a brass section and moved towards soul music. During their six-year career Elipse held hundreds of concerts and performed as an opening band on The Searchers and The Hollies concerts in Yugoslavia. In 1967, Elipse appeared in the movies The Naughty Ones, directed by Kokan Rakonjac, and The Rats Woke Up, directed by Živojin Pavlović. The Naughty Ones were the first Yugoslav and Balkan film to feature a performance of a rock band. The music for the film was written by composer Zoran Hristić. As he lacked experience in composing popular music, he cooperated with Simjanović on the film score. After this cooperation, Hristić persuaded Simjanović to quit his studies of law and to study music. With Elipse Simjanović released three EPs. The band disbanded in 1968, when the band members decided to dedicate themselves to their studies. The Elipse material released on the EPs, along with the unreleased material, appeared on the compilation album Elipse za prijatelje (1963-1968) (Elipse for Friends), released by Simjanović through his own independent record label Simke Music in 1999.

"After Elipse disbanded, Simjanović composed music for various popular music artists, including Seka Kojadinović, Dušan Prelević, Zdravo and Zafir Hadžimanov and Senka Veletanlić. In 1976, Simjanović wrote music for songs ""Dalje, dalje"" (""Further, Further"") and ""Gde je kraj snovima mojim"" (""Where Do My Dreams End"") on the lyrics of writers Milovan Vitezović and Ljubivoje Ršumović respectively; the songs were recorded by the long jumper Nenad Stekić. He also wrote arrangements for songs recorded by Olivera Katarina, Zafir Hadžimanov, Vlastimir Đuza Stojiljković and Senka Veletanlić. At the end of 1970s he stopped composing songs for popular music acts and dedicated himself to film, theatre and television music. He made exceptions occasionally only, most notably in 1985, when he composed the song ""Čarobnjaci"" (""Wizards"") on the lyrics of writer Milan Oklopdžić for the synthpop/pop rock band Laki Pingvini.
