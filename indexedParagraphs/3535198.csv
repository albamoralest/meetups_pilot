"Livaneli was trying to go to Europe because he had gone to jail two times. For his first album, he didn't use his current name, Zülfü Livaneli. Instead, he used the name ""Ozanoglu"". Yet he did not get to the point where he wanted to be, therefore, he started using his current name, Zülfü Livaneli, on his new album, Chants Révolutionnaires Turcs (Turkish Revolutionary songs) in 1971 or 1973. When he was in Europe, his brother Ferhat informed him about how his songs were being sung by everyone in Turkey while they were protesting the government.

Livaneli resigned from the CHP in early 2005, however, in protest at ""CHP's non-democratic and authoritarian system of politics"",During his political career in Ankara, Livaneli presented a legislative proposal for amending Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. The amendment proposed that the concept of ""Turkishness"" should be replaced with that of the ""Turkish nation"" which would put an emphasis on the concept of ""nation"" which, as formulated by the Republic, unites under its umbrella people of different origins. With this amendment, there would no more be a stress on the notion of Turkish race.
