"Kearney was born in 1985 and grew up in Iowa City, Iowa. Her mother played flute. She started her journey with music in the Lutheran Church's Cherub choir. Kearney took piano lessons at the age of 5 and began playing the double bass in the 4th Grade. In high school, she played in the school orchestras and jazz bands and had her own rock and roll band. Although already an accomplished and devoted double bass player at a young age, Kearney's knowledge, skills and innate capacity for creativity took her to a much higher musical level while studying with Mark Urness, a versatile bassist, composer, and educator in Iowa City at the time who now teaches at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. In college Kearney double majored, studying jazz bass at the New England Conservatory of Music and English at Tufts University. As a sophomore, she played with two bands she helped found: Joy Kills Sorrow and Lake Street Dive.

"In 2015 Kearney teamed up with fellow New England Conservatory of Music alumnus Benjamin Lazar Davis to create original works which are in part a fusion of music from the west African country of Ghana and Kearney and Davis' music. Various artists, including Stevo Atambire and Aaron Bebe Sukura as well as musical instruments and cultural elements from Ghana were used by the artists from Ghana, Kearney and Davis in the making of these recordings. The results of these efforts are contained in two recorded music releases: ""Bawa"" in 2015 and ""Still Flying"" in 2020.
