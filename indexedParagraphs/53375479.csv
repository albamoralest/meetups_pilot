"During the band's eight years together, it was subject to censure by the civic-military Uruguayan dictatorship. This censorship was manifested in the cancellation of concerts, or the elimination of parts of the credits from their first Phonogram due to the prohibition imposed upon authors Mario Benedetti, Adela Gleijer, and Diana Reches. In 1987 Rumbo broke up, beginning the prolific personal careers of Ubal and Canoura. Beginning in the middle of 1987 and throughout the following year, Canoura resumes her artistic activity, performing alongside Esteban Klísich and Mauricio Ubal in two series of shows in Montevideo which received a large public response.
