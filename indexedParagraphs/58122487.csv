"Susy Shock was born in the neighborhood of Balvanera, in the center of Buenos Aires, to a father from La Pampa Province and a mother from Tucumán. In 2011 she published Poemario trans pirado and Relatos en Canecalón. She wrote columns in Soy – the diversity supplement of Argentine newspaper Página/12. She contributed to cultural magazines such as Caja Muda (from the National University of Córdoba), Waska, Queer ArtZine, Ají (from Ushuaia), and Colada. Some of her texts were part of the compilation La bombacha apretaba sus testículos. She toured with the poetic musical recital Poemario Trans Pirado throughout the country and Latin America. The number 1 issue of Clítoris Magazine (2011), featured the cartoon ""SuperShiva"" by Susy Shock and Rubén Gauna. According to the specialized blog AV Comics, it tells ""the story of a transvestite immigrant who faces a double intolerance. The story has the intelligence to propose itself as an analogy with the double life of superheroes who must carry a 'secret identity'. Something that, in short, is what happens to the protagonist.""She currently writes columns every month in MU Magazine (of the Lavaca cooperative) and a serial novel – published in Maten al Mensajero – entitled La Loreta. Beginning in November 2013, she appeared in the radio series Crianzas, produced by the Lavaca cooperative.

"Shock was part of the National Front for the Gender Identity Law, an alliance of more than fifteen organizations promoting the sanction at the national level of a law that guarantees the adaptation of all personal documents to the gender identity and the name chosen by people, and access to medical treatments for those who request interventions on their body. The Gender Identity Law was approved by the Argentine parliament on 9 May 2012 and promulgated by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner a few days later, becoming one of the most progressive laws on the subject at an international level.
