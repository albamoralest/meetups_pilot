",1,== Early life ==
"Saasa started with music in high school as a guitarist in a rock band. She did not like working with a group, because she couldn't explain herself through the music and decided to go solo. Beginning with acoustic guitar, Saasa changed to electric. Saasa started as a singer-songwriter in 2005 with the debut of her self-made album Good Morning, which was only available at her live concerts.
",2,== Early life ==
"She continued to perform and released more self-made singles and albums, until Giza Studio became interested. In March 2009, she released her major debut single, called Hello, Hello, Hello (ハローハローハロー). It failed to chart on Oricon. Saasa's first full album was released in July 2009, called Naturela (ナチュリラ). She released 2 more albums before going on hiatus until September 2013. In 2014, she started being active as an indie artist and released her self-made album LeLe Salad, only available in Japan. She's active as of 2019.
