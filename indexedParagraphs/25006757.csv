"Pierre de Corbie (died after 1195) was an early trouvère from the Île-de-France. He is probably the same person as the magister Petrus de Corbeia (""master Peter of Corbie"") who served as a canon at Notre Dame d'Arras between 1188 and 1195. All seven of his surviving songs are found in only a few sources; all the melodies are in bar form and several songs have been assigned different melodies by different sources:
