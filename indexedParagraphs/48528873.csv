"Alan Bergman was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1925, the son of Ruth (Margulies), a homemaker and community volunteer, and Samuel Bergman, who worked in children's clothing sales. He studied at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and earned his master's degree in music at UCLA. Marilyn Bergman was born in 1928, coincidentally at the same Brooklyn hospital where Alan had been born three years earlier, and was the daughter of Edith (Arkin) and Albert A. Katz. Both Alan and Marilyn are from Jewish families. Marilyn studied music at The High School of Music & Art in New York before studying psychology and English at New York University. Alan worked as a television director and songwriter at Philadelphia's WCAU-TV in the early 1950s. Johnny Mercer encouraged Alan to move to Los Angeles and become a professional songwriter. Despite the geographical proximity of their upbringing in New York, the Bergmans did not meet until they had both moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. Marilyn had moved to California and was friends with songwriter Bob Russell and his wife, Anna, and later described ""drifting into songwriting really by accident because I had a fall and broke my shoulder and couldn't play piano so I started writing lyrics"". Marilyn also felt that she lacked the discipline or talent required to become a concert pianist. The Bergmans had both become collaborators with composer Lew Spence, and only met when Spence suggested they all work together. The Bergmans married in 1958, and had a daughter, Julie Bergman Sender, who works as an independent film producer. With Spence, the Bergmans wrote the lyrics for the title tracks for Dean Martin's 1958 album Sleep Warm and Frank Sinatra's 1960 album Nice 'n' Easy. In 1961, the Bergmans wrote their first title song for a motion picture, for The Right Approach, composed by Spence. In 1964, the Bergmans wrote lyrics to their first Broadway musical, Something More!, to music by Sammy Fain. The Bergmans wrote lyrics for ""In the Heat of the Night"" with music by Quincy Jones for the 1967 film of the same name, which has been described as their ""breakthrough"". The couple had later work with Jones on Michael Jackson's soundtrack album for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), for which they wrote the lyrics for ""Someone In the Dark"", and the 2007 Ennio Morricone tribute album We All Love Ennio Morricone for which they wrote lyrics to ""I Knew I Loved You"", which was sung by Celine Dion. The Bergmans' long relationship with the French composer Michel Legrand began in the late 1960s. The couple wrote English lyrics for Legrand's song ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" featured in The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), which won them their first Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 41st Academy Awards in 1969. The Bergmans and Legrand were subsequently nominated for the Best Original Song award in the following two years for ""What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?"" from The Happy Ending (1969), and ""Pieces of Dreams"" from the 1970 film of the same name. The couple's minor work with Legrand in this period included ""Listen to the Sea"" from Ice Station Zebra (1968), and ""Nobody Knows"" and ""Sweet Gingerbread Man"" from The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970). Legrand also featured eight of the Bergmans' lyrics on his 1972 album with Sarah Vaughan. The Bergmans teamed up with Marvin Hamlisch to write Barbra Streisand's hit ""The Way We Were"" used in the film of the same name. The song was labeled by Turner Classic Movies's Andrea Passafiume as ""one of the most recognizable songs in the world"". Hamlisch and the Bergmans won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 46th Academy Awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1974, and the Grammy Award for Song of the Year in 1975. According to the National Endowment for the Arts and Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in their list of the top 365 ""Songs of the Century"", the single was placed at number 298. In 1983, at the 55th Academy Awards, the Bergmans' work on ""How Do You Keep the Music Playing?"" composed by Legrand for the film Best Friends was nominated for the Best Original Song award. The Bergmans became the first songwriters ever to have written three of the five nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song, being nominated for ""It Might Be You"" from Tootsie (composed by Dave Grusin), and ""If We Were in Love"" from Yes, Giorgio (composed by John Williams), in addition to ""How Do You Keep the Music Playing?"". At the subsequent Academy Awards, their work with Legrand on the 1983 film Yentl won them the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation Score, with the songs ""Papa, Can You Hear Me?"" and ""The Way He Makes Me Feel"" from the film also being nominated for the Best Original Song award.

In addition to their work on the films Yentl and The Way We Were, in which Streisand starred, the Bergmans wrote Streisand's One Voice concert which was released as a live album in 1987.
