"The occupation of Denmark (9 April 1940 – 5 May 1945) had a great influence on Meincke’s life. He joined the Danish Nazi Party (DNSAP) on 14 October 1940, openly declaring his views. During the occupation, Meincke worked on revues and plays that were sympathetic towards the occupying Nazis. When the occupation ended, Meincke was punished for his collaboration, and was expelled from all possible organizations.

He debuted at age 17 (circa 1919) with song texts for the summer theater in Stege (Danish: Stege Sommerteater). For some years, Meincke was also director for the theater Over Stalden in Charlottenlund, and Fønix Teatret, where he at times also came on stage.

"Osvald HelmuthDuring the German occupation, Meincke became enemies with his audience and many of his colleagues due to his political views. He participated in a German-friendly revue, and he complained to the German censorship over being made fun of in a song by Poul Henningsen. After the war ended, Meincke was isolated, an isolation which was only broken at the celebration of his 40 year anniversary as a writer.
