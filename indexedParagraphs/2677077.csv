"Schwartz joined Miller in 1937, remaining with his orchestra until 1942. He was featured on all the ballad numbers. With the addition of Schwartz’s characteristic tone in the Miller reed section, the sound of the Miller band became one that none of the imitators could ever reproduce. Prior to joining Miller, Schwartz had played with the New York City-based Julie Wintz’s band.
