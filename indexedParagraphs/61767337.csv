She then worked as an independent photographer, capturing a shot of the poet W. H. Auden after requesting to take his picture in an Oxford tea shop. Simon was later hired as a staff photographer by Dave Fudger, the art director for the music weekly, Disc.

The same year, she began photoshoots with William S. Burroughs, a writer. Simon continued her career at additional publications such as Sounds and New Musical Express, documenting musicians from the emerging punk rock scene. On April 23, 1976, she photographed the Sex Pistols and their manager Malcolm McLaren during the moments leading up to a concert fight with the audience at the Nashville Rooms in West Kensington, capturing the violence instrumental to the group's initial publicity. The following November, she took photographs of The Clash in an alley outside Bernard Rhodes’ Rehearsal Rehearsals in Camden, north London, one of which was used for the front cover of the group's self-titled debut album.

"In July 1975, Simon shot a performance by Bob Marley and The Wailers at the Lyceum Theatre in London. The next year, in 1976, she was sent to Jamaica by Chris Blackwell, the owner of Island Records, to photograph reggae artist Bunny Wailer for the promotion of his Blackheart Man album. During the trip, she also photographed Wailer's fellow reggae pioneers including Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Lee ""Scratch"" Perry. Simon captured a photograph of Marley by the pool which appeared as the front cover for his album, Kaya. The photograph was noted by Marie-Monique Robin as one of the historic images of the 20th century. Her photograph was noted in the Lens section of The New York Times by John Leland who wrote:
",7,== Career == | === Bob Marley ===
"The photo has since made its way around the globe, perhaps unwittingly contributing to the tourism-board image that has grown around Marley. Yet there is also a vitality to the image – the sharpness of Marley's gaze, the wiry strength under the athletic suit – that is harder to possess or cuddle up to, even for a face that has become a global brand. In the frame he is both smaller and larger than his image.

"In 1977, Simon shot the European leg of Marley's Exodus Tour. She continued to photograph Marley for the next four years, documenting his performances and everyday life until his death in 1981.
