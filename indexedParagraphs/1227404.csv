"While attending art college in Manchester Godley met future creative partner Lol Creme. Godley and Creme joined R&B combo The Sabres. They became involved in a number of bands such as The Mockingbirds, Hotlegs and later 10cc. As part of the bands Godley was a songwriter, lead singer, played drums, percussion and keyboards. Godley and Creme recorded four albums with 10cc. In 1977, early in the recording of the album Deceptive Bends, unimpressed with the songs by bandmates Eric Stewart and Graham Gouldman and eager to work on other projects outside of the band, Godley and Creme left. After leaving 10cc the two became known as Godley & Creme, both as musicians and film directors. They were jointly nominated for a Grammy Award for 'Best Music Video, Long Form', for The Police: Synchronicity Concert in 1986. The duo split in 1988 after their album Goodbye Blue Sky.

"Both Godley and Creme briefly 'reunited' with their former 10cc bandmates Stewart and Gouldman on the 1992 album ...Meanwhile. However, Godley claims that their involvement with the project was very limited, as the album was dominated by studio musicians. He performed the lead vocal on ""The Stars Didn't Show"", the band's tribute to the late Roy Orbison. It was the only song on the album not sung by Stewart. Following ...Meanwhile, Godley and Creme went their separate ways again, having experienced difficulties together as early as 1988. Godley later again reunited with Gouldman to form the band GG/06. Together they recorded a self-titled EP, which was made available for free via their website. Since then Godley has several times joined Gouldman's iteration of 10cc in concert, and was featured on the live album Clever Clogs. More recently Godley moved into developing a music platform for the iPad, one that combines audio and video to create a global recording studio in the cloud called ""WholeWorldBand"". The company was nominated for the ""SXSW Music Accelerator Award"" in 2013, and was one of eight finalists selected from a pool of over 500. In 2017, Godley publicly invited musicians to send him music to work on his first solo album, titled Muscle Memory with the idea being that he would take the rough ideas and turn them into a finished song. The album was originally supposed to be released in 2018 through campaign on pledgemusic.com, but due to its closure the release was postponed. In 2021, Kevin Godley's album Muscle Memory was completed and released by The state51 Conspiracy after the project stalled as a PledgeMusic campaign. In 2018, Godley was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Arts by Staffordshire University. He currently lives in Dublin, Ireland, and hopes to direct a film based on Orson Welles' time in Ireland.
