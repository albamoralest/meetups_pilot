"The series centered on Meatballs & Spaghetti, a husband-and-wife singing duo who roamed the country in a mobile home with their friend Clyde (who was their bassist), and their dog Woofer (who was their drummer). The main characters — fat Meatballs and skinny Spaghetti — were intended to be a mix of popular musicians Meat Loaf and Sonny & Cher. There was at least one original song in each episode.
