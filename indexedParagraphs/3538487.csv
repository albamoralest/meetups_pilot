",2,== Biography ==
"Mazzola has recorded several free jazz CDs with musicians like Mat Maneri, Heinz Geisser, Sirone, Jeff Kaiser, Scott Fields, Matt Turner and Rob Brown.
",3,== Biography ==
"Mazzola is well known for his application of sophisticated mathematical concepts such as topos theory to music theory, described in his book The Topos of Music. The result has drawn consent from Alexander Grothendieck (Das ist wohl schon die Mathematik des neuen Zeitalters.) and dissent from Dmitri Tymoczko, who said of Mazzola: ""If you can't learn algebraic geometry, he sometimes seems to be saying, then you have no business trying to understand Mozart.""Currently he is Professor at the School of Music at the University of Minnesota. Since 2007 he is the president of the Society for Mathematics and Computation in Music.
