"MacNeal had released one solo single – a cover, produced by Hans van Hemert, of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", written by Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong and made famous by singer Marvin Gaye – before teaming up with Willem Duyn (Mouth), to form the duo known as Mouth & MacNeal, recording Pop international hits such as ""How Do You Do"" (1971) and ""Hello-A"" (1972). She was with Mouth & MacNeal from 1971 to 1974 including a participation in the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest with the song ""I See a Star"". After their breakup, she formed her own group in 1975 with her husband Frans Smit (drums), Adri de Hont (guitar), Ben Vermeulen and Wil de Meyer (bass guitar). In 1977, the line-up changed to Smit, Jons Pistoor, Lex Bolderdijk, and Robert Verwey (bass). She participated again in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 where she finished in 5th place with the song Amsterdam. MacNeal was one of the artists who recorded the song Shalom from Holland as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991. In 2000, she became a member of the Dutch Divas, together with Marga Bult.
