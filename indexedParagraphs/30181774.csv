"Satanicpornocultshop is a Japanese experimental music group making assemblage-style compositions that incorporate a variety of musical styles and techniques. The group draws heavily on hip hop and electronic influences to create ""bricolage hip hop"" inspired by the theories of Claude Lévi-Strauss. Beginning in the early 2010s, the group began focusing on Juke and Footwork music, influenced by the Chicago scene.
