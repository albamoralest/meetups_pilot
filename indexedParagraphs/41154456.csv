"Starting his career as vocalist with Swedish rock band Great King Rat, Sundin was described by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page in Kerrang! magazine as ""the nearest thing I've seen to a young Paul Rodgers"". He later joined the Michael Schenker Group and co-wrote and performed on their 1996 album Written in the Sand, and also featured on a live album the following year. He later rejoined MSG in 2004 after the departure of Chris Logan. Sundin subsequently joined forces with ex-Europe guitarist John Norum and has provided vocals for a number of his albums, also composing songs. In 2011, Sundin provided vocals for ex-Thin Lizzy and Motörhead guitarist Brian Robertson's solo album Diamonds and Dirt. Sundin has also formed his own band, House of Leaf, releasing an EP and an album in 2012.
