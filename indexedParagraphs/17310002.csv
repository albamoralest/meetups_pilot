"Jones was born in Naples, Texas, United States, to sharecropping parents,  and played guitar whilst young but switched to piano after a move to Dallas. He often played guitar on one or two songs on his albums and at live performances. In 1936 he relocated to Chicago, where he recorded between 1937 and 1941 on Vocalion, Bluebird, and OKeh. Among his best-known tunes from these recordings were the hit ""Lonesome Bedroom Blues"" and the song ""Tin Pan Alley"". His ""Decoration Blues"" though unissued at the time, was recorded by Sonny Boy Williamson I  in 1938. World War II interrupted his recording career, which he did not resume until 1953, when a single of his, ""Wrong Blues""/""Cool Playing Blues"", was released on Parrot, featuring L. C. McKinley on guitar.

He made further albums in the UK, including one in 1968 that featured Alexis Korner on guitar. One of Jones' songs, ""Highway 51"", was included on Bob Dylan's 1962 debut album, Bob Dylan.
