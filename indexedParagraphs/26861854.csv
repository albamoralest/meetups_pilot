"Luke joined Seikima-II in February 1987, replacing guitarist Jail O'Hashi. Like the other members, Luke adopted the stage persona of an Akuma (""demon"") from the futuristic hyper-evolved dimension Makai (""demon world""), where he was the former Staff General of Military Authorities. They all wear face paint and elaborate stage outfits. The band preaches a demonic religion called Akumakyō through heavy metal music to conquer the Earth. Luke released nine studio albums with them, and is their most credited songwriter. In accordance to their fictional ""prophecy"" and after completing their ""world conquest"", Seikima-II disbanded at the end of the century on December 31, 1999 at 23:59:59. They sold over 10 million records, and have had limited time-reunions in 2005, 2010, and 2015.
