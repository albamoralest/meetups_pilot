"Luiz Mainzi da Cunha Eça (April 3, 1936 – May 24, 1992) was a samba and bossa nova pianist from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who was a member of the Tamba Trio with Helcio Milito and Bebeto Castilho. Trained as a classical pianist, Eça created a formal, but stunning approach to bossa nova classics such as ""The Hill"" by Antonio Carlos Jobim and works by Edu Lobo. His song ""The Dolphin"" is considered a jazz standard and has been recorded by Stan Getz, Bill Evans, and Denny Zeitlin. The Tamba 4 group included Otávio Bailly, who replaced Bebeto.
