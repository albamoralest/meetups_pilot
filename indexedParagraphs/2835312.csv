Other influences are John Bonham, Dave Lombardo, Gar Samuelson, Lars Ulrich, Billy Cobham, and Gene Hoglan. According to DRUM! Magazine, Adler describes his first drum kit as a disaster:
",4,== Biography ==
"""The bass drum legs were different lengths so they wouldn't touch the ground at the same time. Every time I would hit it, it would wobble from left to right. The cymbal stands were duct taped together, and I think after two or three times playing the kit, the pedalboard actually broke in half because it was made of that crappy old fake metal.""
",5,== Biography ==
"In 2006, Adler collaborated with revered progressive guitarist Ron Jarzombek and began the project Blotted Science.
