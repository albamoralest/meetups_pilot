"In 2001, Howard and Harry Dodge again wrote, directed and acted in By Hook or by Crook. The film depicts the tale of two unlikely friends who commit petty crimes as they search for a path to understanding themselves and the outside world. ""We totally home-schooled it, we made this feature film without having made a short or anything, because we're like, we have the urgent need to tell this story, to have these different faces on the screen."" Howard later earned an MFA in directing at UCLA in 2008. He currently is a visiting lecturer at Cornell University.

"Howard was the first trans director for Transparent. The creator Joey Soloway wanted trans directors to tell their own stories. He directed the episodes ""Bulnerable"" (2015), ""When the Battle Is Over"", and ""Just the Facts"" (both in 2016). In September 2017's article in LGBT Weekly, one writer speaks of Howard as:

"""A man whose ability to synthesize the messy intersection between life and art seem apparent yet remarkable... whose many previous videos speak volumes about his talent behind a camera, creates authentic and organic visions that rely on the inherent tension between the ideal and the real.""

"As of early 2017, Howard had begun work on his third feature film A Kid Like Jake starring Claire Danes, Jim Parsons, Octavia Spencer and Transparent actress Amy Landecker. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2018.
