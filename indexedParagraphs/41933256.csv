"The Pacific Mambo Orchestra was founded in 2010 by Mexican Pianist Christian Tumalan and German Trumpeter Steffen Kuehn, and is a 19-piece Latin Big Band orchestra that plays salsa, Latin Jazz, cha cha cha, bachata, and other Latin music. In 2012 they crowd-funded their first album, the self-titled 'Pacific Mambo Orchestra', through Kickstarter.
