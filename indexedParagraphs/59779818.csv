In 2019, she toured nationally as the supporting act for Peking Duk and in May, Puru went on a national tour for her single ""Everything's Better Without You"" with Kinder as support.  The video for her new single ""Why Don't We Get Along"" was launched by Clash magazine which they described as ""Perfect Pop"" also produced by long term collaborator Jon Hume (Sofi Tukker). In 2020 Puru toured with UK artist Yungblud for his Falls Festival side shows where she was compared to US artist Lizzo.

In April 2020, Puru released her single ""Idiot"" with a ""hook that’s an effortless ear worm"". Junkee Media said ""Kira Puru's Tiktok account is fantastic"" including luring Tones and I and a bunch of other musicians to imitate the heavy metal band Korn.
