"Viddal was born in Oslo. She released albums Undergroove (2012) with her band Friensemblet, including live takes at Victoria, the Norwegian Nasjonal Jazzscene in Oslo, where she presents her more or less uklassifiserbare compositions, representing free spirited contemporary music full of improvisation and freewheeling elements. The collaboration was formed in 2004 by the name Chateau Neuf Friensemble, with a history from the 1960s University Big Band and the musical environment surrounding the Department of Musicology at University of Oslo. She also runs her own record label Giraffa Records. With Trude Eick she cooperates in the Eick/Viddal Duo and released the album November Log (2008).
