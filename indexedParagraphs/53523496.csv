"Brooks' career as a disc jockey began when he sent his song to twenty random email addresses that could be related to Martin Garrix. To his delight, the song he sent was played by Garrix at a show. Not long after, Garrix contacted and told Brooks of his enthusiasm for his music. Garrix later invited him to his house to work on the ""Byte"" song. Brooks described the event as a ""crazy story"" and said he felt lucky.
