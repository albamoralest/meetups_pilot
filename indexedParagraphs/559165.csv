"Haynes was born in the Roxbury section of Boston, Massachusetts, United States. His younger brother, Michael E. Haynes, would become an important leader in the black community of Massachusetts, working with Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement, representing Roxbury in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and for forty years serving as pastor of the Twelfth Baptist Church, where King had been a member while he pursued his doctoral degree at Boston University.
",3,== Career ==
"Haynes made his professional debut in 1942 in his native Boston, and began his full-time professional career in 1945. From 1947 to 1949 he worked with saxophonist Lester Young, and from 1949 to 1952 was a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's quintet. He also recorded at the time with pianist Bud Powell and saxophonists Wardell Gray and Stan Getz. From 1953 to 1958, he toured with singer Sarah Vaughan and recorded with her.
",4,== Career ==
"A tribute song was recorded by Jim Keltner and Charlie Watts of the Rolling Stones, and he appeared on stage with the Allman Brothers Band in 2006 and Page McConnell of Phish in 2008. ""Age seems to have just passed him by,"" Watts observed. ""He's eighty-three and in 2006 he was voted Best Contemporary Jazz Drummer [in Modern Drummer magazine's readers' poll]. He's amazing.""In 2008, Haynes lent his voice to the open-world video game Grand Theft Auto IV, to voice himself as the DJ for the fictional contemporary jazz radio station, Jazz Nation Radio 108.5. Haynes was among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Haynes is known to celebrate his birthday on stage, in recent years at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City, where his 95th birthday celebration was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
