"Miyoshi is a founding member of Denver Taiko, the fourth taiko group in North America. In 1976, Denver Taiko started out with a dozen members and only two homemade drums donated by the Japanese American Association, so Miyoshi and the others learned how to make their own drums with the help of San Jose Taiko and Kinnara Taiko. Miyoshi left Denver Taiko in 1978 and moved to California.

",11,== Philosophy ==
"Miyoshi believes that, “Drums from all traditions have a spirit that is alive and vibrant. This spirit comes alive through the joining of wood, skins, metal and other materials that come from the trees, plants, animals and the earth…When all of these elements come into harmony and relationship, with good thoughts and actions, a new life is brought into the world.” He brings this philosophy to drum building, and each Miyoshi taiko is made with respect for the raw materials and closed with a prayer.
