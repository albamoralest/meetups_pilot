"After the break-up, in 1959, of Tubby Hayes' and Ronnie Scott's The Jazz Couriers, of which King had been the manager, he and Scott opened Ronnie Scott's jazz club and King effectively gave up playing to run the club, which he continued to do for several years after Scott's death in 1996. Besides being responsible for the day-to-day running of the club, King was instrumental to the negotiations between the Musicians' Union and the American Federation of Musicians to lift the former's ban on American musicians. Although there had been occasional exchanges for specific concerts, such as Stan Kenton and Louis Armstrong, the new deal provided for more regular exchanges of British and American players. As a direct result of the deal, the Tubby Hayes Quartet performed at the Half Note Club in New York and Zoot Sims was booked for a month-long residency at Ronnie's in November 1961. The success of the agreement led to leading saxophonists, including Sonny Stitt, Stan Getz, Johnny Griffin, Roland Kirk, Al Cohn, Ben Webster and Benny Golson, following suit.
