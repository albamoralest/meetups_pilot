"Michiko Evwana was born in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, on December 8, 1974.  She began playing the piano at the age of five, at which time she began to take interest in soul and jazz music. Minmi began her musical career in 1996, performing at rub-a-dub showcases and hip hop events in the clubs of Osaka. She also began to develop her own sound by making her own original tracks around this period. Minmi signed her first recording deal with JVC Records, releasing the reggae song ""The Perfect Vision"" as her first single in August 2002. Minmi's first single became extremely popular, and was widely accepted and heavily rotated by as many as 20 FM radio stations. ""The Perfect Vision,"" after gradually increasing in popularity, would eventually sell over 500,000 copies. Her second single, ""T.T.T.,"" differed stylistically, more influenced by hip-hop. The single was a moderate success, peaking in the top 10. These were followed by Minmi's debut album Miracle, which debuted at No. 2 and has sold more than 600,000 copies.
