"Copas was born in 1913 in Blue Creek, Ohio, United States. He began performing locally at age 14, and appeared on WLW-AM and WKRC-AM in Cincinnati during the 1930s. In 1940, he moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where he performed on WNOX-AM with his band, the Gold Star Rangers.

"In 1943, Copas achieved national fame when he replaced Eddy Arnold as a vocalist in the Pee Wee King band, and began performing on the Grand Ole Opry. His first solo single, ""Filipino Baby"", released by King Records in 1946, hit number four on the Billboard country chart, and sparked the most successful period of his career. While continuing to appear on the Opry, Copas recorded several other hits during the late 1940s and early 1950s, including ""Signed Sealed and Delivered"", ""The Tennessee Waltz"", ""Tennessee Moon"", ""Breeze"", ""I'm Waltzing with Tears in My Eyes"", ""Candy Kisses"", ""Hangman's Boogie"", and ""The Strange Little Girl"". Copas' 1952 single, ""'Tis Sweet to Be Remembered"", reached number eight on the Billboard country chart, but it was his final top-40 hit for eight years.

"Although Copas did not maintain his popularity of the late 1940s through the next decade, he continued to perform regularly at the Grand Ole Opry, and appeared on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee. After a lackluster partnership with Dot Records, Copas surged to the top of the charts again in 1960 with the biggest hit of his career, ""Alabam"", which remained number one for three months. Other major hits during his successful period with Starday Records in the early 1960s, including ""Flat Top"" and a remake of ""Signed, Sealed And Delivered"", held promising implications for the future of his career.
