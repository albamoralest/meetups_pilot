"Kearns died unexpectedly at the age of 38, on 14 September 2015. The band posted on Sputnikmusic that Kearns reported breathing troubles and lightheadedness during a practice session, and, after trying to relax with a shower and nap, was found to have died peacefully in his sleep from a heart attack. The following year, the remaining members of Bolt Thrower eventually decided to dissolve the band rather than replace Kearns, with frontman Karl Willetts stating, ""I can confirm that Bolt Thrower are definitely over for good. There will be no reunion tours etc... no compromise.""
