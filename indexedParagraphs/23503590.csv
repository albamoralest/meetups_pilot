"Nakazawa has had experience with the arts since childhood. She learned to play piano at the age of five and took several art classes over the next seven years. After entering high school, she began to create her own music and perform live at various local venues. At the age of 16, she met producer Satoshi Kadokura through a family friend. He recommended that Nakazawa begin to pursue a music career in Tokyo. Shortly after graduating from university in 2001, Nakazawa signed onto Universal Music Japan using her real name, where she released four singles and one album over the course of one year. However, sales flopped and her material failed to chart on the Oricon rankings. Nakazawa then stopped releasing further material with Universal Music as she was dismissed from the label. In 2007, she adopted the stage name immi and made several releases with the label Grand Trax (a division of her management agency Grand Funk), along with digital distribution by iTunes, Napster, and Mora. Her first single, ""Cosmic Pink"", was released on 28 November 2007 on iTunes Japan and was downloaded over 50,000 times in one week. The song ""Local Train"" was used in a commercial for Canon. Her second single, ""Klaxon"", was released on 12 March 2008, and contained a cover of ""Lovesong"" by The Cure. On 6 August 2008, she released her first album Switch on iTunes, and a physical CD edition was released on 10 September 2008. In the summer of 2009, she signed to DefStar Records and released her first EP with the label, Wonder EP, on 22 July 2009. Her second EP, Alice EP, was released on 14 October 2009.
