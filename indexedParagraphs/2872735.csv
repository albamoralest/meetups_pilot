"In late 1930s, not long before the war, Mark Bernes starred in two motion pictures: Man With a Rifle and  The Fighter Planes. In both of these films, he performed songs which immediately became famous all over the Soviet Union after each film was released. In the former film, he performed the song ""Clouds Rose Over the City,"" which was a romantic song of a simple young Soviet worker. In the later film, he performed a famous patriotic ballad ""Beloved Town"". This pre-war song was full of hope and optimism, and several years later, encouraged soldiers during the war.

"When the war began, Bernes became among the first singers to perform for the Soviet troops. In 1943, he starred in the motion picture Two Fighters. He played a young soldier from Odessa named Arkady Dzubin. In that film, Bernes demonstrated Jewish wit and humor characteristic of Jews from Odessa. In that film, he sang two masterpiece songs: ""Dark Is the Night"" (Russian: Тёмная ночь, ""Tyomnaya noch"") and ""Scows Full of Mullet"" (Russian: Шаланды полные кефали, ""Shalandy polnye kefali""). The second song is the humorous account of Kostya the sailor from Odessa who ironically spoke to his fiancee Sonya, the fishing girl. The first song, ""Dark Night"" was a serious ballad about a wife with a baby waiting for a soldier in the midst of a deadly fight. The song was sung by Bernes from the point of view of that soldier, who addressed his wife at home and assured her that he will live through all the deadly battles as long as she waits for him. ""Dark Night"" is the most recognizable Soviet song from World War II.

"Bernes's name had become closely associated with World War II. After the war, he continued to perform songs about the war. His greatest hits of the 1950s were ""Boys From Moscow"" (also known as ""Sergey From Malaya Bronnaya Street"") and ""Enemies Burned the Dear House Down"". Both songs were about hardships suffered by people who lost family members in the war, and expressed extreme melancholy, directly confronting death and grief. The latter song, was banned by the government, because it was considered too pessimistic and anti-Soviet. In the song, the soldier grieves for his killed wife, and laments that his hopes had been shattered. By the reasoning of the Soviet authorities, it was unpatriotic to sing about broken hopes when the war was won.

Bernes sang that the soldiers that perished in war turned into cranes, that the cranes are still flying, and, that he will join their ranks. On 16 August, Mark Bernes died. ""Cranes"" was played at his funeral.
