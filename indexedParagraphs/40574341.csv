"Sanders began singing gospel music at the age of 5. By the age of 6, he was the sole support for his family.  His father played piano, and ""Little Stevie"" would sing,  mostly at church appearances.  Although he lacked formal education -- Steve did not graduate from high school -- he was a natural on stage.

"In addition to appearing on Broadway in The Yearling at the age of 12, he was recruited by Otto Preminger in 1967 for the film Hurry Sundown with Faye Dunaway and Jane Fonda.  He also made appearances on Gunsmoke.  The Oak Ridge Boys, who were also a gospel act at the time, used to open for Little Stevie Sanders.

"Upon turning 18, he learned his father had squandered all of his money. Disillusioned and broke, Steve headed to London, began a band called Pyramid, and was known to jam with the local scene, including Mylon Lefever and 10 Years After.  Years later, upon his return to the United States, Steve provided vocals for several projects at studios such as Bang Records and Muscle Shoals.

"Steve made his debut with The Oak Ridge Boys band in 1981 as a rhythm guitarist. When William Lee Golden left, he moved to the front and sang baritone with the group from 1987 to 1995.

"Born in Richland, Georgia, on September 17, 1952, to Lorraine and Herbert Sanders, Steve was the oldest of four children (siblings David and Debra, and stepbrother Noah from Herbert's second marriage).  Steve did not have a typical upbringing.  His father said before his passing, ""I heard his voice from downstairs singing with the piano, and thought, there is my retirement plan.""
",7,== Personal life ==
"Steve met his first wife Mary Milbourn at Bang Records; they had two children, Gaylea and Sevren. Twelve years after his divorce from Milbourn, Steve married Janet Riggins.  The two had met backstage at Bally's in Las Vegas, where the Oak Ridge Boys were performing, and Miss Riggins was a dancer.  They married at the Tennessee Governor's Mansion after an 18-month courtship.

"Immediately after Steve's marriage, his ex-wife began a barrage of harassment and litigation, ultimately draining him financially and causing Steve to leave the group he loved and whose voice had become a country-music mainstay. Eight hours after Steve took his life, sheriff's officers showed up with the most recent and final set of papers filed by Ms. Milbourn.
