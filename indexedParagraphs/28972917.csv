"Egert was born in Mels, Switzerland, as the fifth of eight children. He started to play the guitar at the age of 19. However, when starting his first band ""The Cool"" in 1980 he initially played bass. At that time the band's music was mainly rock, influenced by bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Cream. His interest in blues came only a bit later, almost by accident, through a Swiss Radio program called ""Just The Blues"".

"In 1982, Egert started pursuing music full-time. He left the band to start touring Europe as a street musician, equipped only with an acoustic guitar. Despite difficulties and bad experiences, such as being robbed of everything except his guitar, he carried on and ended up travelling the streets of Europe for the next two years. Returning home he started his next band where he was the band leader, bass player and singer of the three piece blues-rock band 'Express' which lasted from 1984 to 1987. During that time in 1985 he finally made the switch back to guitar. With 'Express' he performed extensively, mainly by touring in Switzerland and Italy. In 1988, with his new band 'No Comment', another three piece blues rock band, he made his first studio recording, the 45 single ""Hold On"". In 1989, he created the 'Andy Egert Blues Band' his current band. With this band he recorded his first album (1990, Andy Egert Blues Band).
