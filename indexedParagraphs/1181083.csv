"Yūne Sugihara was born on July 8, 1969, in Hadano, Kanagawa, in Japan. His Manchukuo-born father played trumpet in the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, and his mother played cello in the same orchestra. He also has a younger sister. From a young age, Sugizo was brought up on classical music and studied classical music theory. At the age of three, by his father's initiative, he started to learn to play the violin. He practiced it for 3 hours per day, but without the right type of music or composer, began to hate playing music, and coercion from his parents aggravated his feeling of repulsion. The situation persisted until the age of ten. His early favorite composers included Beethoven, Bartók, Liszt and J.S. Bach.
",4,== Biography == | === Early life and musical education ===
"When Sugizo was eleven or twelve years old, he began to play the trumpet. He preferred the trumpet's ""dirty"" image from the 1950s through the 1970s over playing the violin, which was seen as something for higher-class people. During his junior high school days, he became exposed to non-classical music types, such as the Japanese synthpop group Yellow Magic Orchestra, the British new wave group Japan, David Bowie's glam rock, and the London punk scene, forming his attraction to rock'n'roll. Sugizo's parents divorced when he was in high school, and his father moved out. He has a good relationship with his mother and has since reconciled with his father, who has another family.

"Despite his father's disapproval, Sugizo acquired a bass guitar and an electric guitar and began to teach himself how to play. He has cited three Japanese guitarists as influences; Masami Tsuchiya, Kazumi Watanabe and You. When he was around the age of 17, then in high school, Sugizo with Shinya on drums and Tezya on vocals formed a power metal band called Pinocchio, where he played as the bassist. Since the internal structure of Pinocchio was not cohesive, Sugizo and Shinya left and briefly joined Kashmir in 1988. On January 16, 1989, they both joined another band which performed at the same live houses, called Lunacy, formed by J and Inoran. With the addition of Ryuichi Kawamura, vocalist from the band Slaughter, the five formed the visual kei rock unit Lunacy. Since J was already the bass player and Inoran preferred to play rhythm guitar, Sugizo became the lead guitarist and took on his stage name, which he believes Shinya came up with. Soon they were discovered by hide (then lead guitarist of X Japan), who got them signed by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki, to his independent label Extasy Records, on which they released their debut album in 1991. Upon their first album release, the band changed their name from Lunacy to Luna Sea. They became one of the most famous rock bands in Japan, selling more than ten million records, as well as performing in China and Taiwan.

"Sugizo's first solo activity came in 1993, when he wrote his first solo song ""Revive"" for the album Dance 2 Noise 004 featuring many musicians, including the group M*A*S*S, which consisted of hide, J and Inoran. In the upcoming three years, a variety of lesser-known musical collaborations and contributions took place.

"After Luna Sea went on break in 1997, Sugizo started his own solo career and opened the independent label ""Cross"" to produce other artists and release his own records. He points out that the opening of his record label was one of his very important projects at the time, but not anymore.

It was followed by his first solo tour ""Abstract Day"" which lasted until the final performance in August at Akasaka Blitz, where he was joined by DJ Krush, Masami Tsuchiya and members of Japan. Then on September 10 he released his second single, ""A Prayer"", which reached number 7 on the charts. On November 19, his first solo album Truth? was released, and reached number 12 on the album charts. It was met with mixed reviews, largely because of the unexpected musical style which mixed different genres with electronica beats. A variety of artists participated in the album, from Ryuichi Sakamoto and Mick Karn, to Lou Rhodes and Valerie Etienne. Towards the end of the year, remix editions of his two maxi singles and album were released. As Luna Sea resumed activities, until the band's disbandment, Sugizo collaborated in the studio with actress Miki Nakatani, and singers Miu Sakamoto and Vivian Hsu among others.

"Divorced, Sugizo has a daughter named Luna Artemis Sugihara, who was born on April 27, 1996 in Tokyo, Japan. In an interview he said that her birth has transformed him the most and ""when you love your daughter, you begin to love all children. Although this might sound grandiose, nothing will make me happier than seeing all children around the world lead joyous lives. I'll be more than satisfied if I can become a tool towards that goal"". He briefly dated Taiwanese actress Vivian Hsu. Sugizo finds all religions interesting and reads many books about them. Since his father was a Buddhist, while his mother was a Protestant, from the young age he has often been in contact with things related to church and Protestantism. Currently, he's more into Buddhism, or more specifically, Buddha himself. Ever since he was little he was curious about occult subjects. While in Elementary School, he became obsessed with the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Maya's Easter Islands and the Inca. One of the very important moments were when he was around 18 or 19 years old, after reading Shirley MacLaine's book Out on a Limb, he became even more intrigued about the spiritual world. Noting ""As I grew older, I was able to better understand the things that caught my attention when I was young"". Sugizo in the interview said that ""there are secrets held by a small elite who control the world... We spend our lives without ever being aware of the truth that is hidden from us"", and so through the song ""Tell Me Why You Hide The Truth?"" meant ""We have to liberate freedom and rebuild it by ourselves. I think the world is in need of a revolution. To know what to believe, to know what's really going on in this world we have to take the initiative. That's the sort of signal I'm trying to send"". However, he tries to avoid mixing ideology with music because it changes music as such.

"Sugizo almost exclusively uses ESP guitars and he has around sixteen signature models with them, mostly with the Eclipse body style or other Gibson-style shapes like the RD and Flying V. But their specs are more similar to a Fender Stratocaster than any Gibson, using single coils, alder bodies and maple necks, 25.5"" scale length and tremolos. Lately he's favored a P-90 in the bridge position and vintage-style trems, as opposed to the 3 single coils and Floyd Rose trems he used for most of his career. His signature models feature the ESP logo written in the same font as the Luna Sea band logo, a feature also found on J's and Inoran's signature models.

"For his solo projects and recent shows he also often uses Stratocaster-type guitars from Navigator, a very high-end custom shop related to ESP. His acoustic guitars of choice are usually C.F. Martin Dreadnoughts. He also plays signature electric violins made by Kranz, and his bows are made by Codabow. His amps have changed often throughout his career but are generally high-end and boutique brands, including Fender, Marshall, Mesa/Boogie, Matchless, Bogner, Custom Audio Electronics, Divided by 13 and Koch. Most recently he's been using EVH5150's and EVH 4x12"" cabs with some additional heads like a Diezel Vh4. He's also performed using an Axe-Fx II.
