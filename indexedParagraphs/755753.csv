"Musiq was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in a strict Muslim household. During his teenage years he built a reputation for being musically gifted, beat boxing for MCs free styling on the open mic circuit, scatting at jazz clubs or just performing an a cappella for strangers on the streets, which is where he got the name ""Musiq"" and later added ""Soulchild"". He cites as his inspiration such icons as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and Donny Hathaway as his most influential musical icons. He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music.

""SoBeautiful"" marked the first collaboration between Musiq and the producer JR Hutson, after Hutson had spent ""about eight months"" trying to get Musiq to come by his studio.

His last album for Atlantic MusiqInTheMagiq was released on May 3, 2011, available on CDs and also as a digital download. The first single was ""Anything"" featuring Swizz Beatz, followed by ""Yes"".
