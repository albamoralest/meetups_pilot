"Ock has received much success as one of the most popular leading ladies of Korean musical theater. Often, she is described as a charismatic leading lady with high ticket power. Today she is renowned almost more for her presence as a musical actress than her days as a pop-icon and singer. She debuted in the role of Aida as the lead role in 2005. Many praised her strong vocals but were intensely critical of acting as well as her status as a former k-pop idol. When she returned to the role again in 2010 she fell ill and was unable to make one of the shows. The production only featured a single cast and no understudies or standbys were used during the run. Due to this, the show was cancelled and many people complained at the oversight of the situation; Ock was also blamed for the incident despite the company being at fault. The following year she starred in Chicago and was met with better reviews saying that her acting had improved.

She followed these acclaimed adaptations of European musical theater into a new role as ""Mrs. Danvers"" in the musical ""Rebecca,"" inspired by Hitchcock's movie of the same name. Playing a slightly unhinged and dark character, Ock showed a new side of herself and was rewarded with great popularity among audiences and received the 2013 Korean Musical Award for Best Actress in a supporting role. In 2014, Ock starred as Elphaba in the first Korean production of ""Wicked the Musical"" and also reprises the role of Danvers in ""Rebecca"" due to its popularity in South Korea.
