"In 1977, Lester's song ""De mallemolen"" (""The Merry-Go-Round""), with music written by her brother Frank, was chosen by a celebrity panel as the winner in the Dutch Eurovision selection. Lester went forward to take part in the 22nd Eurovision Song Contest, held in London on 7 May.  Although ""De mallemolen"" had been considered a strong contender prior to the contest, it could only manage a disappointing 12th-place finish of 18 entries.
