"Jordan Timothy Jenks (born September 19, 1993), known professionally as Pi'erre Bourne, is an American record producer, rapper, and audio engineer. He is best known for producing the singles ""Magnolia"" by Playboi Carti and ""Gummo"" by 6ix9ine, with the two peaking at number 29 and 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100, respectively. After the release of Playboi Carti's breakout track ""Magnolia"" from his self-titled debut commercial mixtape Playboi Carti (2017), Bourne's producer tag, ""Yo Pierre, you wanna come out here?"" (a line sampled from an episode of The Jamie Foxx Show), became a viral phenomenon and an internet meme leading the tag to become widely known and Bourne to break out as a producer.

"Jenks was born in Fort Riley, Kansas but grew up in Columbia, South Carolina to a military family from Queens, New York City. Growing up, he would spend his summers with his grandmother in Queens, which led to his interest in East Coast hip hop artists such as Dipset and G-Unit. He is related to Mobile Malachi, a Belizean Kriol Reggae artist and musician. He is also a cousin of Papoose, who is of Liberian descent. Inspired by his uncle Dwight who was a rapper and graphic artist, Jenks first began making beats when he was in elementary school, using FL Studio on his uncle's computer.

"Jenks went to school for graphic design for a year before dropping out. At 18, his uncle encouraged him to pursue his career in music and Jenks moved to Atlanta to study sound engineering at the SAE Institute. While in school, he met and began collaborating with DJ Burn One, who encouraged him to create his own instrumentals and not rely on samples. After graduating school, the studio where the two worked hired him as a full-time engineer. In 2015, Jenks began working for Epic Records as a sound engineer, leaving a year later to focus on his own career.

"Jenks is influenced by Wiz Khalifa, Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane, J Dilla, Pharrell Williams, Timbaland and Kanye West. Like West, Jenks wants to continue to work as a producer, while pursuing his own rap career. Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork described Bourne's productions as ""beats that pair airy video-game melodies with classic trap drums"". His beats typically feature synth pads and flute sounds alternating between 2 or 3 chords.
