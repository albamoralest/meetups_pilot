"Notaro was born in Jackson, Mississippi, the daughter of Mathilde “Susie” (O'Callaghan) and Pat Notaro. Her mother was born in New Orleans. Notaro was raised in Pass Christian, Mississippi, until kindergarten. Her family later moved to Spring, Texas, a suburb of Houston. She has a brother, Renaud Notaro, who is a year older than her and works as a radio talk show host. Notaro's maternal great-great-grandfather was John Fitzpatrick, mayor of New Orleans from 1892 to 1896. When taking part in season 5 of Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Notaro found out that she is also a distant cousin of Gloria Steinem. She has said she hated school. Notaro failed three grades, eventually dropping out of high school. In 1990, while living in Texas, Notaro got her GED.

"Notaro moved to Denver, Colorado, where she became involved in the music industry. She became a band manager, working under the name Tignation Promotions in the mid-'90s. Notaro's work promoting bands took her to Los Angeles, where she tried stand-up for the first time in the late '90s. Notaro has since been featured on Comedy Central Presents and on The Sarah Silverman Program as a lesbian police officer. She collaborates frequently with writing partner Kyle Dunnigan. With Dunnigan and David Huntsberger, she co-hosted the podcast Professor Blastoff from May 2011 until July 2015.

"In 2011, she released her debut stand-up album, Good One. Her 2012 album, Live, is a recording of a stand-up set performed shortly after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

"In 2012, Notaro appeared on Conan, and in May of that year on the live episode of This American Life, which was broadcast to theaters nationwide and on radio in edited form. She performed a monologue about having encountered Taylor Dayne on multiple occasions, greeting her each time with, ""Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but I just have to tell you. I love your voice.""  After her monologue, Dayne made a surprise appearance, serenading Notaro with the song ""I'll Always Love You"". She worked on fellow comedian Amy Schumer's Comedy Central series Inside Amy Schumer. Also in 2012, Notaro did a Kickstarter-funded series called Clown Service written by and starring Notaro. Notaro wrote a memoir for HarperCollins imprint Ecco called I'm Just a Person, and there is a Showtime documentary made about her life that chronicled her post-cancer stand-up tour called Knock Knock, It's Tig Notaro. In July 2015, a Netflix movie called Tig, which chronicles Notaro's attempts to become pregnant with her fiancée, Stephanie Allynne, was also released. The singer Sharon Van Etten wrote a song in homage to Notaro called ""Words"" that is shown in the credits. In November 2015, Notaro co-wrote, produced, and starred in a semi-autobiographical TV pilot for Amazon Video called One Mississippi. The show received a six-episode series order from Amazon a month later. The show follows Notaro's character as she returns to her hometown of Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi, after her mother's unexpected death. Her first stand-up one-hour special was released by HBO in 2015, Tig Notaro: Boyish Girl Interrupted.  In 2016, it was released as her third album on her own label, Bentzen Ball Records, which also put out Aparna Nancherla's Just Putting It Out There.

"In April 2018, it was announced that Notaro would appear in the second season of Star Trek: Discovery as Chief Engineer Jett Reno of the U.S.S. Hiawatha. Netflix released Notaro's second one-hour special, Happy To Be Here, on May 22, 2018. Funny or Die produced Under a Rock with Tig Notaro, a YouTube series in which Notaro tries to guess the identity of celebrity guests, starting in June 2019. Notaro was digitally inserted in post-production in Army of the Dead when director Zack Snyder replaced Chris D'Elia after he was accused of sexual misconduct.

"On her approach to comedy (and whether she considers herself a dark comic): ""I'm always going to do whatever I think is funniest. If something's dark, I'll do it. If it's a sock puppet, if it's a stool, I'll do it. There's no preconceived idea of who I think I might be now."" Notaro said that since her cancer diagnosis, she has shifted not to darker comedy but rather to personal comedy. Previously she was more distant and observational, but now she reflects on her childhood and her life. In the autumn of 2016, she appeared in a video as an onstage ""stand-in"" during the Nostalgic for the Present concert tour of Australian singer Sia for the song ""Diamonds.""

"Notaro met her wife, Stephanie Allynne, on the set of the movie In a World.... They became engaged on January 1, 2015 and were married on October 24, 2015. They welcomed twin sons in 2016, conceived using Allynne's eggs via a surrogate. Notaro plays the guitar and drums and says she is an avid music fan who was in bands when she was younger. ""Tig"" is a childhood nickname given to her by her brother when she was two years old.

"Notaro was diagnosed with cancer in both breasts on July 30, 2012. On August 3, she addressed her cancer diagnosis and other personal difficulties during her live stage show at Largo in Los Angeles. The set has been described as ""instantly legendary"", with many comedians praising her work. The next day, comedian Louis C.K. called Notaro, telling her he wanted to release the audio of the show. She was uncomfortable with the idea at first but decided the material could help people, so she agreed. C.K. made audio of the performance available that October for download on his site under the title Live. Notaro later released the audio (with booklet) on iTunes. Live ended up selling more copies than Kiss's album Monster, which debuted the same week, something Notaro said she never dreamed could happen. She was a fan of the band in her youth. Notaro subsequently had a double mastectomy with no reconstructive surgery. Notaro opted out of chemo but decided to continue treatment with hormone blocking. In November 2014, as part of the New York Comedy Festival, Notaro did a set at Town Hall in New York City wherein she performed part of the set topless. The New York Times described it: ""She showed the audience her scars and then, through the force of her showmanship, made you forget that they were there. It was a powerful, even inspiring, statement about survival and recovery, and yet, it had the larky feel of a dare.""After a show in Philadelphia, Notaro was hospitalized and required surgery for a cyst. In 2017, Notaro adopted a vegan diet, which she credited for eliminating the chronic pain she had experienced in the years following her cancer diagnosis. She later earned a certification in plant-based nutrition.
