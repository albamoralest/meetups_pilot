"An early influence on Douglas Clifford's playing was The Beatles, with their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964 being of particular significance. ""They were a quartet and we said, wow, we can do that. If these guys from England can come out and play rock 'n' roll, we can do it. We bought Beatle wigs. We went to the drama store, and I guess they were Three Stooges wigs at that time."" Clifford, along with Stu Cook and the Fogerty brothers grew up together in El Cerrito, California.
