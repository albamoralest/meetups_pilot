"Beaulieu began to play guitar at the age of 14, studying under Bill Pierce at Mark's Music in Brewer, Maine. He said that Guns N' Roses first piqued his interest in rock music, but his main influence to become a musician was after hearing Metallica. He was asked to join Trivium when he tried out for the band, after the release of their first album Ember to Inferno in 2003. He performed backing vocals for Taking Dawn in 2010. Later, in 2011, Beaulieu performed guest vocals on Maine metal band Rebirth To End's song ""The Weakness Randomization.""

"In the past Beaulieu used mainly Jackson guitars such as the Jackson KV-2 Black Ghost Flames finish (as seen in Roadrunner United bonus DVD) and DX10D series occasionally using a B. C Rich Warlock and a Blue Ibanez guitar, until Rita Haney, partner of 20 years to Dimebag Darrell gave him and Matt Heafy each one of Dimebag's signature Dean guitars in the same year, later spawning a three-year-long endorsement with Dean Guitars, with Beaulieu sporting a black 7 string Razorback V with silver bevels. He also had a signature model V. This V is metallic red with the Trivium circle logo placed between the bridge and neck pickups and is also fitted with a Floyd Rose Locking Tremolo and a Seymour Duncan Dimebucker.

"He left Dean guitars in the summer of 2009, and later signed with Jackson Guitars. He has recently been seen playing various custom Jackson V guitars and is in talks with Jackson regarding the development of a signature guitar. At the 2013 Winter NAMM Show, Jackson officially released Beaulieu's Signature Guitar, available in 6- and 7-string variants, all made in the US.
