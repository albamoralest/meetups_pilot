"Miranda (birth name: Ismael Miranda Carrero ) was born in Aguada, Puerto Rico and grew up in New York City on East 13th Street in Manhattan's East Village. He wanted to become a musician as a child. His musical inclination led him to form two different juvenile groups, ""The 4J's and Little Junior"" and ""The Class Mates"" by the time he was eleven years old. He sang and played conga for the group and they appeared on Jerry Lewis's Muscular Dystrophy Telethon. Miranda also grew up and played in his first bands with Jazz percussionist Orlando ""Q"" Rodriguez and piano player Mark Dimond.

"In 1967, when Miranda was 17 years old, he made his recording debut with the song ""Let's Ball"" with Joey Pastrana and had his first ""hit"" with ""Rumbón Melón"".  He was hired as bandleader Larry Harlow's lead singer.  That same year Miranda and Harlow co-authored ""El Exigente"" (""The Demanding One""), set to the rhythm of Latin Boogaloo.

"In 1969, Miranda joined the Fania All Stars and went with the band on tour to Europe, Asia and Latin America.  In 1973, he formed his own band called ""Orquesta Revelación"" and recorded ""Así se compone un son"" under the Fania record label.  He was then baptized as ""El Niño Bonito de la Salsa"" ('The Pretty Boy of Salsa"").  During the 1970s, he continued to have more songs like ""Lupe, Lupe"", ""Señor Sereno"". In 1984, Miranda recorded an album for Fania with the Cuban conjunto Sonora Matancera. By 1988, he had planned to retire. However, he went on to establish his own record label ""IM Records"" and recorded several boleros with Andy Montañez.  By 1992, he signed under the management of Chino Rodríguez in New York City, who negotiated with the late Jerry Masucci on the Fania All-Star Reunion of 1994.
