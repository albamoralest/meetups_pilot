"Temnikova started to study music when she was five years old; she was playing violin and singing in the choir. She came to media prominence as a contestant on the Channel One talent show Star Factory in 2003. She was spotted by Maxim Fadeev, the main producer of Star Factory, and signed a recording contract with Fadeev's recording company Monolit Records. Although Temnikova released two disco singles, ""Begi"" and ""Taina"", she did not continue her solo career, and did not release a solo album. She instead joined Serebro, a girl group formed by Fadeev. In an interview for the magazine InStyle, in February 2008, Temnikova said: ""After Star Factory, Maxim Fadeev offered me a new job. He offered me to be lead singer in girl band. I decided to do it, and we together found second and third member"". Olga Seryabkina and Marina Lizorkina also joined the group.

"Raised in Kurgan, at the end of 2002 she moved to Omsk for few months and then to Moscow due to professional obligations. In 2004, Temnikova married Alexei Semyonov, who was also a contestant in Star Factory. Temnikova sought separation soon after, but Semyonov would not agree to it. In the meantime, Semyonov fell in love with another woman and eventually sent Temnikova divorce papers, and the couple officially divorced after four years of marriage. In 2014, Temnikova secretly married entrepreneur Dmitry Sergeev in the Maldives. Their daughter, Alexandra, was born on 27 March 2015. In June 2019, Temnikova's former bandmate Olga Seryabkina came out as bisexual in an interview with the Russian tabloid Super. She did so to dispel rumors she was in a relationship with Maxim Fadeev, which were spread by Temnikova. In the interview, Seryabkina confirmed she had been in a four-year relationship with Temnikova while they were bandmates, and that the relationship was well-known throughout their inner circle, but they had never confirmed it publicly.
