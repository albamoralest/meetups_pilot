",1,== Biography ==
"Kwes began playing his grandparents' organ at the age of four and his grandmother bought him his first small keyboard aged 5.  For his tenth birthday, he received a radio/tape recorder with a built-in microphone, which launched his interest in sound recording. Kwes has chromesthesia (sound-to-colour synaesthesia). His earliest synaesthetic experiences occurred around the age of 4 and he attempted to colour paper with the particular colours he was seeing when listening to music.  These colours have been set since he first discovered his condition: ""any form of a G-chord would have orange in it, and the other notes which are not G accompanying that G-chord would have an effect on the type of orange it is.  Majors tend to be slightly brighter. Same applies for D which is always – yellow/green, E which is Yellow/gold, F which is violet/blue, C – Blue, A – light blue, B – yellow/gold/green.""

"Colour is not in my direct field of vision, it's more in my peripheral field of vision, so it's just something that's always going on; it doesn't annoy me, or it doesn't amuse me, or it doesn't make me feel good, it's a normal occurrence to me. But at the same time, that could be why I love music so much. His synaesthetic impressions of his own music are translated in the artwork to his solo releases, including ""Hearts in Home"" and ""No Need to Run"".
