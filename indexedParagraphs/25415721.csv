"Hatzis immigrated to Canada in 1982 and became a Canadian citizen in 1985. He composed music related to Christian spirituality, particularly his Byzantine heritage, and the Canadian Inuit culture.

"He won the Jules Léger Prize for New Chamber Music  in 1996. In 1998, Hatzis received the Jean A. Chalmers National Music Award.  He won two Juno Awards in 2006, including Best Classical Composition for String Quartet No. I (The Awakening), which was recorded by the St. Lawrence String Quartet. Hatzis won another Juno in 2008 for his work Constantinople; it combined music and visual media and is musically eclectic, featuring jazz, classical, and eastern elements.  The work was performed at  halls at Banff and Toronto during the summer and fall of 2004, to critical acclaim from the Toronto Star and the Calgary Herald.  Constantinople has been performed internationally.
