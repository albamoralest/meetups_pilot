"Killjoy's fiction writing includes queer anarchist steampunk and folk horror. Killjoy published What Lies Beneath the Clock Tower, a steampunk interactive novel, in 2011. In 2017, Killjoy published the first of two books in the Danielle Cain series, which features a group of genderqueer, anarchist demon hunters in the American heartland. In the first novella, The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion, the group is hunted by a demon that appears in the form of a stag. The second book in the series, The Barrow Will Send What It May, follows members of the same group as they run from the events of the first book. The Lamb Will Slaughter the Lion was nominated for a Shirley Jackson Award in 2017. The Barrow Will Send What It May was nominated in the 31st Lambda Literary Awards in the LGBTQ science fiction and fantasy category. Killjoy contributed the short story ""We Won't Be Here Tomorrow"" to A Punk Rock Future, a 2019 anthology of speculative science fiction and fantasy. Killjoy has also edited and written non-fiction works, including the 2009 book Mythmakers & Lawbreakers: Anarchist Writers on Fiction, a collection of interviews with anarchist authors including Ursula K. Le Guin and Alan Moore. She also was an editor of SteamPunk Magazine, which was in print from 2007 to 2016.
