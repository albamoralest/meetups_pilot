"Dejan Matić was born in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the son of Zoran and Dragica. He and his twin brother Aleksandar ""Saša"" were born prematurely and had a difficult first few weeks of life, having to be placed in incubators in a Zagreb maternity hospital. For unknown reasons, both babies became completely blind only days after birth. The family relocated to Belgrade in 1982, when the brothers were four years of age. It was in Belgrade that they attended music school, playing the piano. The Matić brothers finished their schooling in Zemun.
