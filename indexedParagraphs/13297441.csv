"Goodhand-Tait was known as Phil Tait in his school years. His mother was a piano teacher and his father was involved in trade unions. Goodhand-Tait began his music career shortly after the family moved to Guildford, Surrey, in 1957. His first group, Phill Tone and the Vibrants, was renamed Phill and the Stormsville Shakers in 1961. The band included Paul Demers on drums, Ivor Shackleton on guitar, and Kirk Riddle on bass. He wrote and recorded songs that have been covered by Roger Daltrey (""Oceans Away"",  ""Parade"", and ""Leon""), Euson (""Leon""), Gene Pitney (""You Are"" and ""Oceans Away""), Zoot Money (""No One But You""), and Love Affair (""Bringing on Back the Good Times"", ""A Day Without Love"", ""Lincoln County"", ""One Road"" and ""Baby I Know""). In 1971 he wrote the soundtrack for the film Universal Soldier. In 1976 he played the harmonium on Chris De Burgh's album, Spanish Train and Other Stories. Goodhand-Tait has also produced live albums by Magnum, Venom, Climax Blues Band, Kid Creole and the Coconuts and The Lords of the New Church.
