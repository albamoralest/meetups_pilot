"Diamanté Anthony Blackmon was born on January 3, 1991, in Guatemala. The ""Letting People Go"" music video retraces his family's journey from Nicaragua, through Guatemala, and across the southern US border as illegal immigrants. He grew up in Frederick, Maryland, United States. He attended Walkersville High School in Walkersville, Maryland. When he was 16 years old, he started playing in small clubs in his hometown of Frederick. While he struggled to gain support from most schoolmates during his time at Walkersville HS, a few recognized his potential and wished him the best. Those students fondly remember his original tagline - ""Carnage in Da Building"", with them still shouting it out when entering house parties.
