"Speaking in June 2008 to English R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Roudette explained the musical background to Rhythms & Hymns: ""With this album I wanted to bring through more aspects of the live show, which is something maybe the first album lacked. You know, we do go out with a seven or eight-piece band, and that has become a big part of the Mattafix sound. So, in addition to keeping the hardcore element and programmed beats from last time round, with Rhythms & Hymns we've also used a lot of live drums. Also, we've added quite a lot of influences that we got from the road. Particularly in places like Johannesburg, South Africa, where we played a couple of great shows.""

He is yet to come up with his new artist name; whether to stay with the name Mattafix, or choose a new stage name; perhaps his own.
