"After working with Ginuwine, Garrett assisted in producing songs for Nicole Wray for her 1998 debut album, Make It Hot. He would eventually become the lead songwriter for Aaliyah. His songwriting collaborations with Aaliyah include: ""Are You That Somebody?"", which was featured in the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack, and the Romeo Must Die soundtrack singles ""Come Back in One Piece"" and her only Billboard Hot 100 number-one single ""Try Again"". The songs ""More than a Woman"", ""We Need a Resolution"", ""Rock the Boat"", ""Loose Rap"" (which he was also featured on), ""Extra Smooth"", ""I Refuse"", ""Read Between the Lines"", ""Those Were the Days"", and ""Never No More"" were all featured on her third and final studio album Aaliyah. Garrett collaborated with R&B group Pretty Ricky on their 2005 song ""Juicy"". He was featured on Lil Wayne's chart-topping 2008 song ""Lollipop"", which he co-wrote. Garrett once reflected on where his inspiration comes from, saying ""I stay in the streets, that's where I draw my inspiration [...] If it can't be played in the hood, then it just doesn't work for me. And nobody can hold me on harmony. My whole aura is not your typical R&B aura.""
