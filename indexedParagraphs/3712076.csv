Although The Knife very rarely performed live concerts, Olof performs as DJ Coolof in nightclubs across Europe. He only performs at nights or at festivals with equal gender representation on the lineup of artists – no more than 50% people who identify as men. In late 2009 and early 2010, Olof released four EPs under the pseudonym Oni Ayhun.
