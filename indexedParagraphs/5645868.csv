"He went on to achieve fame in the United States with a co-starring role alongside Jay North in the 1966 film Maya. The film's success led to a television series of the same name airing on NBC from September 1967 to February 1968 and lasting 18 episodes. The show led to Sajid becoming a ""teen idol"" for a short time appearing on the cover of popular magazines worldwide. He also had a short-lived singing career but was not successful. In 1968, he guest starred in an episode of the television series The Big Valley, and appeared in the music variety show It's Happening as a guest judge.

"He also found success in the Philippines in the early 1970s, starring as the male lead in a number of romantic comedy films opposite leading Philippine actresses Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos. He tried to get back into Hindi films, but none of his Hindi films from 1972 to 1983 worked financially. His career's peak period was in 1966–1974 and he was more successful in English films. He made his last film appearance in the Merchant Ivory film Heat and Dust in 1983 which was successful.
