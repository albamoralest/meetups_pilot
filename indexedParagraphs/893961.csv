"In 1998, at the age of 14, Lennevald signed a record deal with Stockholm Records (part of Universal Music Group) along with his then band mates, Sara, Marie and Amit. Together they performed as the A-Teens. In 1999, they released their first single, a cover of the legendary band ABBA, Mamma Mia. The single topped the charts in Sweden for 8 consecutive weeks, and the success was similar around the world.

"After the A-Teens went their separate ways in 2004, Dhani chose to return to the studio in order to write and record new songs. ""Girl Talk"" is the introduction to Lennevald's solo career. The record company freely admits that there hadn’t been much speculation surrounding a solo career for Lennevald. On the contrary, most of the questions regarding solo careers have centred on the girls in the band.

"Lennevald approached the record company with five new songs, just one and a half weeks after the end of the tour. Lennevald's driving force in delivering songs of such quality and in a relatively short space of time impressed everyone concerned.

"Lennevald created a new sound, assisted by producer Peter Björklund, in which his voice is the prime focus. His first release was the single, ""Girl Talk"", a kind of tragicomedy about the inability of men to really understand what their girlfriends are trying to say to them.

"The video for ""Girl Talk"", directed by Mikeadelica, was filmed in a sunny Stockholm day, during the middle of August. Also involved in the song and the video were Denmark’s biggest rap artists, Nik & Jay.
