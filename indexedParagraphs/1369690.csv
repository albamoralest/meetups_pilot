"Palumbo has Crohn's disease, which has acted as inspiration for much of his musical output, most notably in the lyrical content of Glassjaw's major label debut Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence. His affliction has affected his bands' ability to tour, including the cancellation of a tour with The Used in 2005.

"Palumbo has worked with many different artists including Alien Ant Farm (performing live with them on their cover of Bad Brains' ""Gene Machine""), The Movielife (on the track, ""Another Friend""), Ray Cappo (on Glassjaw's cover of the Youth of Today song, ""Modern Love Story""), The Rondo Brothers (on the tracks ""Hey Stewardess"", ""Whispering Reef"", and ""Take Me Back""), Silent Majority (on the track ""Popular Opinion""), Every Time I Die (on the track ""Champing at the Bit"" from Gutter Phenomenon), Finch (on the tracks ""Project Mayhem"" and ""Grey Matter"" from What It Is to Burn), Cage Kennylz (on the track ""Shoot Frank"" from Hell's Winter) and Dan the Automator's Handsome Boy Modeling School. In interviews Palumbo has expressed an interest to work with British singer/songwriter and producer Nick Lowe. In 2004, Palumbo made a brief appearance in the Lostprophets music video for their track ""Last Summer"", alongside Head Automatica bassist Jarvis Holden. In October 2005, Palumbo appeared as a guest vocalist on the track, ""No Way Out"" on the album Roadrunner United: The All Star Sessions. The album was a collaboration between past and current bands signed to Roadrunner Records. This release was significant as it showed a new, positive attitude towards the label from Palumbo. Previously, he and Justin Beck had voiced negative statements regarding the label relating to their treatment by Roadrunner and subsequent move to Warner Bros..
