"Burke was born in Antioch, California, United States, the son of Mary Agnes (Mungovan), a schoolteacher, and William Earl Burke, a structural engineer. When he was still young, his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where Burke's father founded a construction business. As a youth, Burke studied piano and drama. He attended Crane College and then the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he played piano in the orchestra. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1927, Burke joined the Chicago office of the Irving Berlin Publishing Company in 1926 as a pianist and song salesman. He also played piano in dance bands and vaudeville.

"Irving Berlin Publishing transferred Burke to its New York City office, where he began to write lyrics in collaboration with composer Harold Spina. In 1932, they wrote ""Shadows on the Swanee"", followed in 1933 by ""Annie Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", their first big hit for the Guy Lombardo Orchestra. In 1934, Burke and Spina wrote ""You're Not the Only Oyster in the Stew"", which was a novelty hit for Fats Waller, as was ""My Very Good Friend, the Milkman"". Burke and Spina wrote many songs that were played by leading bands of the day, including those led by Ben Pollack, Paul Whiteman and Ozzie Nelson. The Burke - Spina partnership ended in 1936 when Burke left for Hollywood.

"Burke's first partner in Hollywood was Arthur Johnston. He then worked with Jimmy Monaco, but he was to make his mark in collaboration with Jimmy Van Heusen. The team of Burke and Van Heusen turned out some of the great hit tunes of the 1940s. Burke signed a contract with Paramount in 1939, and spent his entire career with the same studio. Burke's primary function as a lyricist was working on the films of Bing Crosby. Of the 41 films on which he worked, 25 starred Bing Crosby. Seventeen songs were substantial hits, including ""Pennies from Heaven"", ""I've Got a Pocketful of Dreams"", ""Only Forever"", ""Moonlight Becomes You"" and ""Sunday, Monday, or Always"". Another Burke-Van Heusen song that Crosby recorded was ""Sunshine Cake"", which Crosby also sang with Clarence Muse and Coleen Gray in Frank Capra's 1950 Paramount film Riding High. The song was also recorded by Peggy Lee, Jo Stafford and Dick Haymes, and later Tiny Tim. Other Burke-Van Heusen songs Crosby performed in Riding High included ""A Sure Thing,"" ""Someplace on Anywhere Road"", and ""The Horse Told Me.""
