"In 2000 she released her third album, Minage, a tribute to the Italian singer Mina. In an interview that year, she mentioned that the album was like nothing her producers expected:They were expecting another Palabra de Mujer album, but more than just a hit, I wanted something to let the world know that I am also a fanatic, and that there are many great artists/singers out there who deserve more recognition. An example of such an artist is Mina Mazzini. Minage was known for the song ""Sobreviviré"", a hit song that would turn into one of the most remembered and representative hits of the singer. This song, which is a cover of Mina Mazzini's ""Fiume azurro"" is not only considered a fight song, but also an LGTB anthem and a hymn against domestic violence. She performed that song during the ""Pavarotti and Friends"" gala, where she also performed ""Agnus dei"" in a duet with the Italian tenor.
