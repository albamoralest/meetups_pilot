"In 2018 the film Claudio Fasoli's Innersounds by Angelo Poli and Carlodavid Mauri is also released. Written by Angelo Poli and Marc Tibaldi. Directed by Angelo Poli. Music by Claudio Fasoli. The film is a journey into the creative processes of jazz musician Claudio Fasoli, a journey in stages, an intimate and unedited black and white portrait. Fasoli's voice reveals his thoughts as he speaks directly to each individual viewer and helps us to enter the evolution of the creative process, and its key concepts such as time, improvisation, silence, subtraction, risk, unpredictability. The film follows the entire process of creation of a new composition by Claudio Fasoli: idea, composition, sharing with the group, improvisation. The composition and the chords drawn on the piano, played with the sax, the musical arrangement with the Quintet in the rehearsal room, up to the live performance. The editing is marked by the absolute respect of Claudio's music, for this reason ""Claudio Fasoli's Innersounds"" as well as being a portrait of a great of jazz, aspires to be in itself a true jazz film.
