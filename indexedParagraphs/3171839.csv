"Born in Washington, D.C., Strum moved with his family and was raised in Southern California's San Fernando Valley. He developed a love of rock music and began playing the bass guitar at age eight. He formed the band D.O.A. at the age of 13 and by age 17 was performing on the LA club circuit with the band Badaxe, and recorded an LP,  The album was not up to the band's expectations so they replaced their lead vocalist with Bobby Gaudreau a lead vocalist from another well known band on the L A circuit.  BobbyG being a Guitarist and Songwriter as well as Lead vocalist began re-writing the songs on Badaxe's previously recorded LP and added new original songs. Badaxe members BobbyG, lead vocals, keys and guitar, Dana Strum, bass Guitar, Steve Ward, percussion, and David Carruth, lead guitar recorded and released the single, Cry For Me written by BobbyG and All You Can Stand co-written by BobbyG and David Carruth in 1977.  Only a few copies were made and released on a private label (Progrezzive Records).  Even so the single received a recommendation from BillBoard Magazine and succeeded in landing Badaxe a recording deal. While the band recorded its second LP at Dalton Studios in Santa Monica, Ca. it became a fixture on the L.A. club circuit along with future chart-toppers Van Halen, Quiet Riot, and Mötley Crüe.  The album was finished but due to conflicts within the band it has never been released.
