"On a scholarship at age 16, Morrow studied trombone with Ernest Horatio Clarke (1865–1947) at Juilliard from October to December 1936. During the next year he began playing trombone with Sharkey Bonano's Sharks of Rhythm, an Eddie Condon group. He then worked with Eddy Duchin, Vincent Lopez, and Artie Shaw. He became known as ""Buddy Morrow"" in 1938 when he joined the Tommy Dorsey band. In 1939 he performed with Paul Whiteman's Concert Orchestra for their recording of Gershwin's Concerto in F. In 1940, Morrow joined the Tony Pastor band, but this was only a short detour on his way to replacing Ray Conniff in the Bob Crosby band. Shortly thereafter, he joined the U.S. Navy, during which he recorded with Billy Butterfield, leading a ten-piece band with three trombones, accompanying Red McKenzie singing four arrangements, including ""Sweet Lorraine"" and ""It's the Talk of the Town"".

"After demobilization, Morrow joined Jimmy Dorsey's band, then went into radio freelancing as a studio musician. He began conducting sessions, which introduced him to bandleading. RCA Victor sponsored him as director of his band in 1951. The band's first hit, ""Night Train"" by Jimmy Forrest, was a hit in rhythm and blues. Morrow's early 1950s records such as ""Rose, Rose, I Love You"" and ""Night Train"" appeared on the Billboard magazine charts. ""Night Train"" reached No. 12 in the U.K. Singles Chart in March 1953. In 1959 and 1960 Morrow's Orchestra released two albums of American television theme songs: Impact and Double Impact respectively. Morrow was a member of The Tonight Show Band.
