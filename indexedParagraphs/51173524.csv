"Starrah grew up in Delaware as the youngest of nine siblings. She has stated that she ""grew up in the ghetto"" and has written lyrics about police raids she experienced as a child. Her songwriting grew from writing short stories and poems. She attended Delaware State University and moves to Los Angeles after graduation to pursue a music career. After a period of uploading music to SoundCloud and selling samples through Instagram, a manager in the industry reached out to her. He connected her to more songwriters which led to Starrah writing ""Be Real"" by Kid Ink in 2015, which reached No. 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2016, Starrah wrote several songs that became top 40 hits. ""2 Phones"" by Kevin Gates reached double platinum status. Rihanna's single ""Needed Me"" reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 42 weeks on the chart. On September 22, 2017, Starrah released a joint EP with producer Diplo titled Starrah x Diplo. In April 2019, Starrah formed a partnership with Hipgnosis Songs Fund. She worked closely with Madonna for her 2019 album Madame X, writing on six tracks. Starrah released her debut single ""How It Goes"" on August 12, 2020.

"Starrah stated that she writes lyrics first, and then finds a melody and production to fit them. In her early career, she was sometimes turned away from studio sessions for being ""too urban"", but later found success with urban crossover into mainstream pop music.
