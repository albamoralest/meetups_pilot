"Mahagama Sekera was born on 7 April 1929 in Radawana, Colombo. His father was Maha Gamage John Appuhamy, mother was Ranawaka Arachchige Rosalin. He had his initial education at Kirindiwela Maha Vidayalaya. Sekera started life as an artist and although in his later paintings and book covers he tended towards modern art. He got a thorough grounding in the forms and techniques of formal art at the Government School of Fine Arts of which he later became the Principal. Thus at a young age he was exposed to new ways of looking at the world and perceiving reality which combined with the folk culture of his inheritance in a typical village milieu gave its particular strength to his world view.Sekera started his Doctoral Studies at Vidyodaya University of Ceylon in 1974. His thesis on ""Sinhala Gadya Padya Nirmana Kerehi Ridmaya Balapa Athi Akaraya"" (Influence of Rhythm on the Sinhala Prose and Poetry) was submitted to the University in 1975. At the time of passing away in 1976, he was attending to the final editing of the thesis as recommended by the supervisors.
