"In 1997, Bradley signed with the newly formed V2 Records with a project called 'Lovebabies'. They released their debut single 'Explore' in the same year. A follow up single was released in early 1998, ""Blue Earth Angel"", featuring remixes from Attica Blues, Morcheeba and DJ Pulse. A full-length album was recorded under the title ""For The Realization of Zion"". Bradley became one of the original members of the UK production house Xenomania with whom he amassed a long list of pop credits, working with artists such as Sugababes, Girls Aloud, Natalie Imbruglia and Gabriella Cilmi. In 2012, Bradley produced and arranged Above & Beyond's Acoustic album. He brought in singers Alex Vargas and Annie Drury and was also joined by regular contributor Zoë Johnston for the project. The album spawned a succession of live concerts starting at London's Porchester Hall and Los Angeles' Greek Theatre, where they were joined on stage by EDM pioneer Skrillex. The performances were described by Billboard magazine as ""one of the finest and more memorable shows in EDM history"". As of 2021, Bob has been working on his own material, developing talent and new projects with Yungblud, Jeff Beck, Ozzy Osbourne & Johnny Depp under his given name Robert Edward Bradley.
