"Bleu graduated from the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Bleu was known in the local Boston music scene for his live shows and work with other musicians, and received some local notoriety for his debut effort A Bing Bang Holidang, which was a charity benefit for the Boston Institute for Arts Therapy.  A single from that record, ""Boston All Star 12 Dayz,"" received some local airplay, featuring famous local musicians and acts from Guster and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones as well as Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo and Bill Janovitz.

"Bleu would soon follow with his Workaday Day EP before releasing his first proper album, Headroom.  Released via Lunch Records, it received generally positive reviews, but did not take off until Bleu's entry into the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble, which he won in 2001.  This led him to local opening slots with Jump, Little Children and Ben Folds.  He would later win a Boston Music Award for ""Best Boston Band"" (as well as be nominated for 5 in his career), and land a major label contract.

"Bleu's next album, Redhead (called ""an all around power pop treat"" by music critic Aidin Vaziri), was released in 2003 on Aware Records.  Two versions were released; both featured the song ""Somebody Else,"" which was also on the Spider-Man soundtrack.  The first version of the album featured a song, ""Sayonara,"" which had backing vocals from Puffy AmiYumi, and the latter version (released on Columbia Records) contained the single ""Get Up,"" which received moderate national airplay.  The album was also released in Japan with the Puffy AmiYumi guest spot featured, followed by a short tour in Japan.

"In 2006, a side project with Matt Mahaffey of Self called L.E.O. was released.  Featuring contributions from Mike Viola, Andy Sturmer (formerly of Jellyfish), Hanson, and Jason Scheff of Chicago, Alpacas Orgling was meant to be similar to 1970s AM radio pop music, and is described by the band as an ""alt-pop version of the Traveling Wilburys.""In July 2007, Bleu released two EPs on iTunes.  One is a collection of songs he wrote for friends and family members for their birthdays, simply titled Happy Birthday.  The other is credited to the band Blizzard of '05 (also the name of the album).  The 7-song EP was recorded by Bleu, some friends, and some former bandmates when they converted the basement of one of their houses into a recording studio, and holed up there during the Blizzard of '05, which swept across New England and shut down the city of Boston for five days.

"In August 2010, Bleu made the decision to use Kickstarter to fund the release of his already recorded fourth album in the US. (UK label Lojinx had agreed to release the album in Europe.) Fan contributions reached the target of $8000 within 10 hours and went on to raise a total of $39,645 to support the release and marketing of the album in America. Kickstarter named the campaign Best Music Project in the 2010 Kickstarter Awards. The new album, titled Four, was released on CD in Europe on October 25 on Lojinx and on November 2 in North America on Bleu's own ""The Major Label"" imprint. The European digital release date was November 29.

"In November 2012, a crowdfunding for Bleu's fifth record started at pledgemusic.com. The campaign ended October 24, 2013, and was even more successful than Four. One of the many offers from the campaign was the Redhead Record Club. It consisted of re-recorded songs from Redhead for its 10th anniversary. The songs were released individually in digital form. In 2014, the re-recorded collection on CD was made available exclusively for pledgers.

"In 2014, McAuley wrote and produced all of the soundtrack songs for Disney's Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast. KT Tunstall performed vocals on each song, with McAuley lending his vocals for a duet with Tunstall on ""1000 Years."" The director of the film, Steve Loter, had been listening to McAuley's music on his commute to the studio, and ended up approaching McAuley after one of his shows to ask him to work on the film.
