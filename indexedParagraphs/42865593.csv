"Dan Russell is an American musician and songwriter in addition to an artist manager and advocate, musician, songwriter, concert promoter, record producer and music supervisor for television and film. A graduate of Walpole High School in Massachusetts and later Barrington College, Russell is known for managing both the American rock band The Call and songwriter Michael Been and has worked in various capacities with such artists as Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Sam Philips, Mark Heard, U2 and Brad Corrigan, Cheryl Kelley, Robin Lane, Ramona Silver, Vigilantes of Love, Rachael Taylor, among others. Russell is the president of New Sound Artist Management and NewSound International and the co-founder (along with the late Mark Heard and Chuck Long) of record label Fingerprint Records.  In 1994 he received a Grammy nomination for producing Fingerprint's compilation album Strong Hand of Love: A Tribute to Mark Heard, to which he also contributed the song, ""I Just Wanna Get Warm.""  After years of contributing to the careers of other artists, Russell decided to record his debut album, Feel the Echoes, which was successfully funded via Kickstarter, and currently working on a new release for 2022. In 1998, Russell co-founded the first Soulfest, a faith-based social justice multi-day music festival originally held at Loon Mountain in Lincoln, New Hampshire.  Now in its 20th year, Russell continues to produce the festival currently held every summer at the Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, New Hampshire, drawing more than 25,000 attendees annually to see over 100 bands, renowned authors and speakers on four stages. Russell produces concert films and has expanded into music supervision for film and television, and he co-owns a music recording studio with his son Jesse Russell.
