Bay's parents brought him up in Hitchin, Hertfordshire where he attended Hitchin Boys' School. Aged 11, Bay was inspired to play classical guitar after hearing Eric Clapton's ""Layla"". He used an old rusty guitar with five strings he found in a cupboard in his house. Bay is a supporter of Newcastle United F.C. When he moved to study in Brighton at the British and Irish Modern Music Institute seven years later at age 18 he played the city's open mic nights, on which he said, ""That taught me a lot about writing and performing on my own and trying to hold my own"". ""I'm trying to make songs that make people feel something, and if I'm lucky, even move them"".
