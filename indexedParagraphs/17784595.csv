"Roger Shah was born in Esslingen in West Germany to a German mother and a Pakistani father. His brother Pedro del Mar (real name Patrick Shah), also a trance DJ, hosts a bi-weekly vocal trance show called Mellomania. Roger first began to hit his production stride in his native country in 1999 putting out the tracks ""Claps"", ""The Mission"" and ""Tides of Time"". In 2003 his ""High"" release was signed by Virgin Records imprint Nebula. This marked his first non-domestic release, and over the course of the next 5 years he inked productions to a range of trance labels such as Black Hole Recordings, Anjunadeep and Vandit.
",3,== Biography == | === History ===
"Roger Shah has featured in DJ Mag Top 100 list 5 times, peaking at #21. He received a double EMPO nomination for Best Trance & Progressive DJ and Best Radio Show and an IDMA award nomination as break through artist in 2008. As a producer he has worked with and produced for artists such as Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Paul van Dyk, Sarah McLachlan, Kosheen,  Bryan Adams or Moya Brennan.

"In 2007 Armin van Buuren named Shah's ""Who Will Find Me"" release as his favourite track of 2007. Having heard the demo of its follow-up, van Buuren saw crossover potential in the track and made contact in early 2008 to ask if Shah would like to collaborate on it. The result was the Chris Jones song ""Going Wrong"" which reached number 5 in The Netherlands, the track went on to become one of the biggest selling trance singles of the year. From there Magic Island Records – Shah's primary label moved from his own stable to that of one of Armin's Armada Music.

"In late 2008 Shah took the decision to change his artist name. Dropping the 'DJ' prefix, he revised it to Roger Shah – a move that signalled a move away from straightforward DJ sets. During live performance, Roger Shah frequently uses a wireless keyboard interface such as the M-Audio Oxygen 25 (25 key USB midi controller). Roger Shah has mentioned numerous times that he will perform with his laptop instead of CDs.

"In addition to his own name Roger has also produced under various other aliases. Notable among them are his 'pka' DJ Shah, High Noon at Salinas, Magic Island and Savannah. Shah is also one half of the Anjunabeats released act Purple Moods, Black Hole project Global Experience and ASOT's Black Pearl, whose '06 – '09 spanning singles 'Coral Sea', 'Java', 'Bounty Island' and 'Rise' generated much additional interest in Shah's solo productions.

",13,== Biography == | === Sunlounger ===
"This project included the release of the 'Another Day On The Terrace' album in 2008 which reached No.1 on Dutch iTunes' 'all-music-genres' chart and spawned four singles: 'In & Out', 'Aguas Blancas', 'Crawling' & 'White Sand'. The project became so celebrated that Roger expanded Sunlounger into a live act - a performance of which was featured on Armada's ArminOnly DVD. It was this experience that he credited with his latter wholesale move into live Roger Shah performances. In 2009 Roger released the Sunlounger follow-up LP 'Sunny Tales'. Its progeny singles included 'Catwalk', 'Mediterranean Flower', 'Change Your Mind' and the much-revered 'Lost' - voted as Tune of the Year for the 2008 A State of Trance radio show hosted by Armin van Buuren and numerous #1 airplay positions across the globe. His third album, The Beach Side of Life, was released in 2010.
