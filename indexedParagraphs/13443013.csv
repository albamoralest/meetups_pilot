"After the breakup of Aqua, Nystrøm continued as a soloist. In 2003, she released her first album Play with Me. It marked a change in her musical style, from the bubblegum sound of Aqua to a more R&B-influenced style. It reached number 30 on Denmark's Hitlisten chart and 74 on Norway's VG-lista chart. The album single ""Virgin Superstar"" was given some radio airplay, but did not chart and was not released. Her debut single ""It's Your Duty"" was released on 8 September. It peaked at number 3 on Denmark's Hitlisten chart and number 9 on Norway's VG-lista chart. In 2004, she released the second single ""Pretty Young Thing"", a cover of Stella Soleil, which did not chart. She released a third and fourth single as limited vinyl promos of a cover version of ""Here We Go"", which was originally performed by Moonbaby, and ""Scream"" to DJs and radio stations. The song ""We Wanna Party"", which Nystrøm recorded and co-wrote with Xenomania, appeared on Girls Aloud's 2008 album Out of Control. Nystrøm and Xenomania co-wrote two more Girls Aloud songs, the tracks ""No Good Advice"" and ""You Freak Me Out"", which appeared on the Girls Aloud debut album Sound of the Underground. ""No Good Advice"" became a breakout hit for the group. In 2005, Nystrøm provided guest vocals on the LazyB single ""I Love N.Y."" and as part of charity project Giv Til Asien on the single Hvor små vi er, which peaked at number 1 at Danish single charts.
