"On 18 June 2009 it was announced that Marina Lizorkina had left the Russian girl group Serebro, who represented Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 and eventually gained great popularity in Russia and former countries of the USSR. The producer of Serebro, Maxim Fadeev, had opened an audition for a new band member. Karpova replaced Lizorkina, and joined Elena Temnikova and Olga Seryabkina as a new singer of the trio. She stated, ""Destiny often gives you a chance to win. The thing is to use it properly"". Karpova appeared in public as a Serebro member for the first time at the Radio Hit Group Award in Saint Petersburg on 25 June 2009. She has also recently recorded a completely new song with Serebro, ""Like Mary Warner"", and filmed an accompanying music video. At a concert on 27 September 2013 in Saint-Petersburg, Karpova announced that it was her last concert with the group, choosing to leave the group, to focus on her solo career. When Elena Temnikova left, officially on health grounds, Karpova agreed to return temporarily to enable Serebro to fulfill the live concerts as a trio.
