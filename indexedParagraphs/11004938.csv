"Yes, let's rock'n'roll till the break of day...In 1951 he moved on to Dot where he was teamed with the Griffin Brothers, an R&B orchestra led by brothers Jimmy Griffin (trombone) and Ernest ""Buddy"" Griffin (piano) from Norfolk, Virginia.

"In August of that same year Brown was featured singer on the R&B Top 10 hit ""Tra-La-La"", credited to the Griffin Brothers Orchestra, and later in the year the combination reached #1 on the R&B chart with ""Weepin' and Cryin'"", credited to The Griffin Brothers Orchestra featuring Tommy Brown. In early 1952, Brown joined the United States Marine Corps, and when he returned in October of the same year, he moved to United Records in Chicago. While Brown was away, his previous label released in March 1952 the ""No News From Home"" single, which was recorded from earlier sessions. He played for a while in Bill Doggett's band, and claimed to help write Doggett's hit ""Honky Tonk"". He also recorded with Walter Horton during this period. Over the next decade he recorded R&B for a number of smaller labels, including his own T & L Productions which he formed with his wife singer Liz Lands. Brown performed as a comedian in the 1960s and 1970s. He released two live albums for his comedy act, 1967's I Ain't Lyin'  and I Ain't Lyin' Vol. 2 a year later. In 1977, Brown returned to Atlanta to run the Landmark Personal Care Center. After fans sought a return in his musical career, Brown made a comeback in 2001, recording and performing around the world in blues festivals. His past recordings have also been reissued on compilation albums. On May 6, 2015, Brown was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in Memphis. Brown died in 2016, aged 84.
