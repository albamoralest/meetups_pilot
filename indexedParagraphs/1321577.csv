"Farlowe was born in Islington, North London. His musical career began with a skiffle group, the John Henry Skiffle Group, in 1957, before he joined the Johnny Burns Rhythm and Blues Quartet in 1958. He met guitarist Bob Taylor in 1959 and, through Taylor, joined the Thunderbirds, who went on to record five singles for the Columbia label. On Island's Sue label, he released a version of ""Stormy Monday Blues"" under the pseudonym Little Joe Cook (a name also used by an American singer), which perpetuated the myth that he was a black singer.Farlowe moved to Andrew Loog Oldham's Immediate label and recorded eleven singles, five of which were cover versions of Rolling Stones songs including ""Paint It Black"", ""Think"", ""Ride On, Baby"", ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"", and ""Out of Time"", which reached no. 1 (1966) in the UK Singles Chart. He recorded four more singles, the best known of which are Mike d'Abo's ""Handbags and Gladrags"", and ""My Way of Giving"", a cover of a Small Faces album track written by Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane.
