"Peterik started performing in 1964 with some of his schoolmates in Berwyn, Illinois, as The Ides of March.  Their hits included ""You Wouldn't Listen"", ""Vehicle"", and ""L.A. Goodbye"" in the late 1960s and early 1970s. ""Vehicle"", which was number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart the week of May 23, 1970, is purported to be the fastest selling single in Warner Bros. Records history. Peterik graduated from Morton West High School in 1968 and Morton Junior College in 1970, and attended college classes while ""Vehicle"" became a national hit.

"In the early 1970s Peterik wrote several songs recorded by the jazz-rock band Chase and performed on their 1974 album Pure Music. In 1976 he released a solo album, Don't Fight the Feeling, and toured as the Jim Peterik Band with Bruce Gaitsch (guitar), Terry Fryer (keyboards), and Chase's rhythm section of Dennis Keith Johnson (bass) and Gary Smith (drums). They toured with several of the era's most popular bands, including Heart and Boston.

"In 1978, the Jim Peterik Band had broken up and Peterik was considering going back to singing and producing jingles. After several days of pleading with Peterik, road manager/sound man Rick Weigand persuaded him to meet with guitarist Frankie Sullivan. Within an hour of that first meeting, the band Survivor was born. In the early years of Survivor, Peterik continued to co-write hits for other artists, including 38 Special and Sammy Hagar. In 1982, Sylvester Stallone commissioned Survivor to write and perform the theme song for Rocky III.  This song, ""Eye of the Tiger"", became their defining single, spending six weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and going double platinum. ""Eye of the Tiger"" also won a Grammy Award and resulted in an Oscar nomination for Peterik and Frankie Sullivan for Best Song.

"Their 1984 album, Vital Signs, featured the Top 10 hits ""High on You"" (No. 8) and ""The Search Is Over"" (No. 4), and another sizable hit, ""I Can't Hold Back"" (No. 13). In 1985, Peterik co-wrote the theme song to Rocky IV, ""Burning Heart"", which would be another big hit (No. 2 in early 1986) for Survivor. ""Burning Heart"" was followed by Number 7 hit, ""Is This Love"".
