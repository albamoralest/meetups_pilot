"Before B*Witched, Keavy worked as a part-time trainee car mechanic at her father's garage. In an interview, Edele talked about her bond with her twin: ""She's the greatest gift I've ever been given, and I think a lot of identical twins would say that. She really is my other half, and I'm not the same without her. We've worked together most of our lives and when we looked back on when B*Witched split and we went our separate ways for the first time, that was like our first day at school. I missed her.""
