"BMI presented Curci with the Million-airs award for ""More Than Words Can Say."" According to BMI's web site, only 1,500 songs have achieved Million-air status (one million air plays) among the 4.5 million songs by 300,000 BMI represented artists. One million performances is the equivalent of approximately 50,000 broadcast hours, or more than 5.7 years of continuous airplay.

"In January 2009, Alias announced the release of their long delayed second album. This album titled Never Say Never sat unreleased for 18 years. The second album was recorded in 1992 to follow Alias's debut album, but it was never released due to the rapidly evolving music scene of that time where Grunge was the new rage and metal was out. A few of the songs from this ""lost"" album were re-recorded and appeared on Curci's solo album Dreamer's Road, but the rest remained unreleased.
