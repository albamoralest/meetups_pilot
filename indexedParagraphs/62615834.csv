"Mimi Melnick was born Miriam Clar in Hollywood, California on December 25, 1935.  Her father, Charles Clar, was a high-end fireplace merchant, and her mother, Reva Howitt, was a dancer.  She studied classical piano as a child and graduated from John Marshall High School in 1953.  Melnick went on to attend UCLA, graduating in 1960 with a music degree.  Beginning in 1958, Melnick worked as a music critic for the Los Angeles Times, ending her tenure there in 1965 after writing over 200 articles, mostly about jazz musicians and concerts but also covering classical music and theatre events.  In addition, she wrote articles for a variety of other publications including Vogue, Life, Harper’s, Folklore International, Jazz Review, California Historical Quarterly, and over 70 articles in the journal Western Folklore. After her career as a music journalist, Melnick developed an interest in other areas as well.  She co-wrote two books (and a scholarly article in California Historical Quarterly) on manhole covers as historical artifacts and urban art with her husband, Robert Melnick. Her research and advocacy resulted in the city of Los Angeles officially preserving fifteen manhole covers in 1984 at Heritage Square historic park.  She also contributed to, edited, and published her mother's autobiography on her life as a vaudeville dancer. Melnick began to host jazz salons (known as the Double M Jazz Salon) in the living room of her Encino home in 1996, attracting dozens of talented musicians (such as Horace Tapscott, Bobby Bradford, and Gerald Wiggins) as well as hundreds of jazz fans including Morgan Freeman, Marla Gibbs, Amber Tamblyn, and Russ Tamblyn.  Her mailing list of invitees grew to 500, and average attendance at the salons was about 70.
