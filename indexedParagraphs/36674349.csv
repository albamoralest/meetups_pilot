"Davison's earliest involvement with music began when he sang in the church youth choir led by his mother. From an early age, she instilled in him an appreciation for music and love for singing. Soon after he took up guitar and bass, which eventually led him during High School to perform in various original and cover bands with his childhood best friend, Taylor Hawkins (currently the drummer for Foo Fighters). It was Hawkins who gave Jon the nickname ""Juano"" that has stuck to this day.

"In February 2012, Davison was announced as the new lead singer of Yes, replacing Benoît David, who left the group because of illness. ""Strangely enough, Jon's name came up when we started working with Benoit,"" Yes bassist Chris Squire recalled. ""In fact, my friend, Taylor Hawkins, had been telling me for years: 'If you ever need a replacement (singer), I know exactly the guy.'"" Davison has described how the band had a tour booked when David dropped out, ""so there was sort of this frantic race to resolve this matter [...] because they weren't going to back out of the tour. So in the same moment, perhaps even the same hour, of the same day, Chris is calling Taylor to get my phone number, because he's gonna give me a call, and then the manager is also working on contacting me, so I got contacted by both of them.""Davison has toured with Yes since joining the band, and sang lead on 2014's Heaven & Earth. He wrote or co-wrote seven out of the eight tracks. In July 2020, Davison said the band were at work writing their next album, stating that it was still in the early stages of compiling demos, but the band has half an album of material ready. ""The Quest,"" Yes's 22nd studio album and the second to feature lead vocals by Davison, was released on October 1, 2021.
