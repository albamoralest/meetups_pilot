"Joe Mullins was born and raised in southwestern Ohio. His father Paul ""Moon"" Mullins was a respected fiddler and broadcaster of a daytime bluegrass show on Classic Country Radio for more than four decades. Mullins toured and recorded as a member of the Traditional Grass, the band he founded with his father, from 1983 until 1995. The band signed to Rebel Records and recorded four albums for the label between 1992 and 1995 following four previous independent projects on cassette. In 1995, Mullins purchased WBZI Radio in Xenia, Ohio. He later purchased WKFI (Wilmington), WEDI (Eaton), FM 100.3 (Xenia / Dayton / Springfield), and FM 105.5 (Eaton / Dayton), of which he operates all as Real Roots Radio under Town and Country Broadcasting, Inc., having been renamed in March 2018 from My Classic Country. In 1995, Mullins released Just A Five String & Fiddle, an album of duets with the late fiddler Gerald Evans, with whom he'd played in Traditional Grass. In 1997, Mullins became a founding member of the band Longview, along with Dudley Connell, James King, Don Rigsby, Glen Duncan, and Marshall Wilborn. Longview earned the International Bluegrass Music Association (IBMA) Song of the Year and Recorded Event of the Year awards. In 2006, Mullins formed his band The Radio Ramblers to promote his radio stations. Members included Adam McIntosh (guitar), Evan McGregor (fiddle), Mike Terry (mandolin), and Tim Kidd (bass). The band released their first CD in 2007 called Tuned In (independent MULLINS-3272-CD) followed by their first Rebel Records release Rambler’s Call album in 2010. In 2011, Mullins released a gospel album Hymns from the Hills, with Larry Sparks, Doyle Lawson, and Rhonda Vincent guested. Playing My Song followed in 2012. In 2013, Mullins and Junior Sisk released Hall of Fame Bluegrass, an album of duets to honor members of the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame. Assisting were Jason Carter, Jesse Brock, Rob Ickes, Dudley Connell, and Marshall Wilborn. On July 27, 2013, Joe Mullins and the Radio Ramblers made their Grand Ole Opry debut, and have continued to make regular appearances ever since. Mullins released the album Another Day From Life in 2014. In 2015, Mullins and the Radio Ramblers released the album Sacred Memories which featured contributions from Ricky Skaggs, Rhonda Vincent, and the Isaacs and won two IBMA awards for Gospel Recording of the Year in 2016 and 2017. In 2015, Mullins began hosting a syndicated radio show called Front Porch Fellowship on Singing News Radio which is aired across much of the U.S. and Canada each week. Mullins released the album The Story We Tell in 2017. The Radio Ramblers included Mullins (banjo), Mike Terry (mandolin), Jason Barie (fiddle), Duane Sparks (guitar), and Randy Barnes (bass). Joe and the Radio Ramblers changed recording labels with a November 13, 2018 announcement and have released their debut album on Billy Blue Records on March 29, 2019 titled For the Record. Joe is widely considered one of the world's most accomplished five-string banjo players in the traditional bluegrass style.  Although primarily a Scruggs style player, his playing is also influenced by the work of J.D. Crowe, Sonny Osborne, and Don Reno.  Vocal influences are apparent from the Osborne Brothers and Paul Williams.
