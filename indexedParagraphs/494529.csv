"PIG tends to sound more orchestral than KMFDM, with darker, more complex, more ambient beats.  His album and song titles tend to be witty, rife with alliteration (""Prayer Praise & Profit"") or are plays on the titles of popular works or phrases (The Swining / ""Symphony for the Devil""). He also manages to work food, heroin or pork related terms into his albums. Like KMFDM, humor features prominently in PIG's lyrics, although they tend towards a darker/grittier tone than KMFDM's.

"Because Raymond Watts is a central figure in both PIG and KMFDM, the two projects have seen much crossover.  Watts has contributed his skills as a songwriter and vocalist to several KMFDM albums, including their first album Opium in 1984, and has a heavy presence on their 1995 album Nihil, which spawned the hit ""Juke Joint Jezebel"". A collaborative EP titled Sin Sex & Salvation was released in 1994 under the moniker ""PIG vs. KMFDM"". KMFDM has in turn assisted Watts with his PIG projects in production and personnel.  Current KMFDM guitarists Steve White and Jules Hodgson (as well as former KMFDM guitarist Günter Schulz)
