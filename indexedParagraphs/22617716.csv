"August Henrik Winding was born in Tårs, near Sandby on the island of Lolland. His father was a clergyman who collected and arranged Danish folk songs, and also an excellent pianist who became his son's first music teacher. August’s three brothers were equally highly musical, most of all his brother Peter Buonaventura who, despite his early death at the age of 16, had some of his works published. In 1847, August’s parents sent the 12 year old to Copenhagen for musical education. He stayed there at the house of J.P.E. Hartmann and was given piano lessons by Carl Reinecke until the latter’s departure for Paris in 1848, and then by Anton Rée (1820-1886), who had been an acquaintance of Frédéric Chopin. He also was taught theory and composition by Niels Gade.  In 1856 he went to Leipzig for further studies, and then had  lessons with Alexander Dreyschock in Prague. who called him «the best of his pupils hitherto».

"His public career was originally as a pianist; he became rapidly the leading pianist of his days in Denmark, but also played in many countries of Europe, specialising in Beethoven and Mozart.  His ""calling card"" was Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto. In 1864 he married J. P. E. Hartmann's daughter Clara (Niels Gade married another daughter). In 1867 he became a teacher at the Royal Danish Conservatory in Copenhagen and also privately. August Winding was one of Edvard Grieg's closest friends.

"In 1867 he injured his arm through overwork, which forced his retirement as a performer but also enabled him to devote himself to composing.  In 1881, he resumed his pedagogical activity at the conservatorium.  Between 1888 and his death he gave some further concerts.
