"Kohmi Hirose (広瀬 香美, Hirose Kōmi, born April 12, 1966) is a Japanese pop singer and songwriter. Since the release of her million-selling single ""Romance no Kamisama"" in 1993, Hirose has recorded music for winter-sporting goods company Alpen's advertising campaigns. This has prompted the Japanese public to bestow upon her the nickname of ""Winter Queen"" (冬の女王, Fuyu no Joō).

"After returning from America, her first album ""Bingo!"" was released in July 1992, but the first big hit for her was her third single, released in December 1993, ""Romance no Kamisama"", which sold 1.75 million copies. Subsequent album and single releases around that time of year, as well as her sponsorship deal with the skiing goods company Alpen to write songs for their winter-time commercials, earned her the title of the ""Winter Queen"", and this was reinforced with the single ""Gelaende ga Tokeru Hodo Koishitai"" in December 1995. Her 1998 compilation of these singles, The Best ""Love Winters"", is certified multi-million, having sold 2.4 million copies. She hosts a weekly show on Ustream.tv called ""Friday Kohmi"". In 2011, she released ""Egao no Megamisama"" to the iTunes Store to raise money for the recovery from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, using 120 viewers of her show to form the chorus. For her 20th anniversary in 2012, Hirose released a compilation album titled Single Collection and an English language cover album of Christmas songs titled Love X'mas, working with Jun Abe, Satori Shiraishi, Yuji Toriyama, and Takeshi Nakatsuka to arrange it. She also embarked on a 3-stop anniversary tour called ""Happy & Smile ～Super Best Selection～"", with concerts at the Zepp Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka halls.
