"Dana Dane's career began as part of the Kangol Crew with fellow rapper Slick Rick, to whom he sounded markedly similar, although Slick Rick's English lilt was actually genuine, while Dana Dane's was an affectation. Dana Dane appeared in the video for Slick Rick's 1988 single ""Teenage Love"". After graduating from high school, he signed with Profile Records in 1985. Dana Dane's debut album, Dana Dane with Fame, peaked at #46 on the Billboard album chart and was certified gold. His debut single was ""Nightmares"". His biggest hit in the United States was ""Cinderfella Dana Dane"", which peaked at #11 on Billboard magazine's R&B charts in 1987. Cheryl Green from Queens, NY sang backup. He was among Profile Recordsâ€™s core artists, then recorded briefly for Rap-A-Lot Records but did not release anything on that label. He released his last album, Rollin' Wit Dana Dane, in 1995 on Maverick Records.
