"Shrestha formally started his musical career in the late 1960s. This era is deemed as the golden era of Nepali modern music. Before this he performed in cultural programs and other locally organized functions in eastern Nepal. His opportunity to officially pursue music came when a Dharan theatre team came to Kathmandu to stage a drama in Rastriya Nachghar, including the Late King Mahendra. Shrestha portrayed a singer. His melodious voice and well-composed music held everyone spellbound. King Mahendra was so impressed that he allowed Shrestha to record as many songs as he wished. In 2025 (Bikram Sambat), when even established singers had to wait for many days to schedule a recording session at Radio Nepal (the only recording studio then), he was allowed to record six songs. In subsequent years, Shrestha came to Kathmandu once in a year to record. After 2028 B.S., Shrestha started participating in the Nationwide Music Competition, which led to a first prize in vocals in 2030 B.S. for the song ""Bidhawako Sindoorko Rahar"".

"Shrestha was musically active for another decade. Then, slowly, he stopped singing. He was busy with his official work and 'did not feel like recording new songs'. The Nepalese music industry expanded and professionalized. Technology drew him back and he again started singing.
