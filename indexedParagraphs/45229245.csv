"She created the duo Snowdrops with Mathieu Gabry in 2015. Together they composed the original score of Manta Ray (film) by Phuttiphong Aroonpheng, and they released in 2020 the album Volutes on Injazero Records. The Guardian has selected the release in the 10 best contemporary discs of 2020; for the writer John Lewis, ""what’s remarkable is how radically different Christine Ott manages to make the ondes sound on each track: from a primeval, guttural sound on the 13-minute Odysseus to a chirruping boy soprano on Ultraviolet.""
