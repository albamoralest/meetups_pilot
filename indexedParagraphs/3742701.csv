"In 1985, Tommy and his brother, Bill Page, formed a band called Broken Promises in New Jersey. They were signed to Broccoli Rabe Records and released a self-titled four-track EP. Tommy is credited as playing keyboards, piano, and performs backing vocals. A year later, to help support himself during his first year at Stern (then 16), Page worked as a cloakroom attendant in a popular New York nightclub called Nell's. The job gave Page a chance to play his demo tape to the house DJ, who then used the demos as part of his club mixes. The unknown sounds so impressed him that soon Page was introduced to Sire Records founder Seymour Stein. When Page turned 18, he was asked to write the theme tune of the film Shag and released it as his first single. Page's self-titled debut album was released by Sire/Warner Bros. Records in November 1988 and contained hits such as ""A Zillion Kisses"", ""Turning Me On"", ""I Think I'm in Love"", and ""A Shoulder to Cry On"".

"The follow-up album Paintings in My Mind (which he dedicated to his grandmother) gave Page a No. 1 single in the U.S., ""I'll Be Your Everything"", a song that was written with and features members of New Kids on the Block. Other singles from the album that were released after that were ""When I Dream of You"" and ""Turn on the Radio"" (another New Kids on the Block collaboration). The album also features ""Don't Give Up on Love"", a duet with Latin freestyle singer Sa-Fire. Sa-Fire and Page co-wrote the song, which was released as a single overseas.

"Page's third album, released in 1991, was titled From the Heart, and his vocals there showcased a wider range with higher notes than previous efforts. On this album, the ballads were more orchestral. Tommy cited the songs in the album were inspired by the current music trend at the time of Wilson Phillips. The first single, ""Whenever You Close Your Eyes"", saw Page working with Michael Bolton and Diane Warren. ""Under the Rainbow"" and ""Madly in Love"" also were released as singles.
