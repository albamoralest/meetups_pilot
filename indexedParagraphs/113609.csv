Thereafter he published several volumes of poetry, including New and Collected Poems (Faber, 1989). Wilbur was also a translator, specializing in the 17th century French comedies of Molière and dramas of Jean Racine.

Wilbur also published several children's books, including Opposites, More Opposites, and The Disappearing Alphabet. In 1959 he became the general editor of The Laurel Poetry Series (Dell Publishing).

He provided lyrics to several songs in Leonard Bernstein's 1956 musical Candide, including the famous ""Glitter and Be Gay"" and ""Make Our Garden Grow."" He also produced several unpublished works, including ""The Wing"" and ""To Beatrice"".
