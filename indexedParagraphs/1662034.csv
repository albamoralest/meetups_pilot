"Wilde was born in Blackheath, London.  He was performing under the name Reg Patterson at London's Condor Club in 1957, when he was spotted by impresario Larry Parnes.
",2,== Career ==
"Parnes gave his protégés stage names like Billy Fury, Duffy Power and Dickie Pride, hence the change to Wilde. The 'Marty' came from the acclaimed 1955 film of the same name.  Wilde was signed to the British recording arm of Philips Records, with US releases appearing on the Epic label via Philips' reciprocal licensing agreement with Columbia Records stateside.  (Philips had yet to acquire the Mercury group as its US division.)From mid-1958 to the end of 1959, Wilde was one of the leading British rock and roll singers, along with Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard. Wilde's backing group was called the Wildcats. At various times they featured Big Jim Sullivan on lead guitar, Tony Belcher on rhythm guitar, Bobby Graham or Bobbie Clarke on drums, plus Brian Locking on bass guitar and Brian Bennett on drums, who both later joined the Shadows. He appeared regularly on the BBC Television show 6.5 Special and was the main regular artiste on the Saturday ITV popular music shows Oh Boy! and Boy Meets Girls. There he met and married Joyce Baker, one of the Vernons Girls who were also show regulars. Their courtship was made public but, after the marriage, Wilde's popularity as a teen idol declined. He moved partly into all-round entertainment, appearing in musicals such as Conrad Birdie in the original West End production of Bye Bye Birdie and several films. He enjoyed success as a songwriter in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In collaboration with the songwriter Ronnie Scott, he co-wrote the one-hit wonders the Casuals' ""Jesamine"" under the pseudonyms of Frere Manston and Jack Gellar. The pair also wrote Lulu's ""I'm a Tiger"" and the early Status Quo hit, ""Ice in the Sun"". He also tried to tap into the growing glam rock boom, releasing the single ""Rock'n'Roll Crazy"" / ""Right On!"" billed as Zappo, and recording as The Dazzling All Night Rock Show (""20 Fantastic Bands""), and Ruby Pearl and The Dreamboats (""The Shang-A-Lang Song""). None of the releases were a commercial success, and Wilde ditched the glam rock genre, going on to work with his son, Ricky Wilde. Like many of his contemporaries, Wilde continued to perform in nostalgia tours in the UK and beyond. In 2007, he celebrated 50 years in the business with another UK tour which featured his youngest daughter Roxanne Wilde, and the issue of a compilation album, Born To Rock And Roll – The Greatest Hits. It included a duet with Kim Wilde of Elton John's ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"", which was released as a promotional only single.

"In 2017, Wilde went on a UK tour with The Solid Gold Rock'n'Roll Show, which also featured Eden Kane, Mark Wynter and Mike Berry. In 2019, he toured the UK again with American artist Charlie Gracie and Mike Berry.  The projected 2020 tour  has been re-scheduled to 2021 due to the Covid-19 health situation. On 9 October 2020, Wilde entered the UK Albums Chart at number 75 with Running Together.  It was released on his own Pushka label, and featured his daughters Kim and Roxanne Wilde, with input from son Ricky. Wilde thus has the distinction of UK chart success, as either a singer or songwriter, across eight consecutive decades.
