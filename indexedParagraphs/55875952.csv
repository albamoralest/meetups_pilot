Her solo performance at the Ljubljana Jazz Festival was released on CD in 2013. She performed with Susana Santos Silva at the Moers Festival. In 2016 she also played at the Moldejazz with Susana Santos Silva. At the 2017 JazzFest Berlin she impressed the audience in a trio with Petter Eldh and Christian Lillinger.

"Draksler's music has been described as being ""in the border area and in the intersection of jazz, free improvised music, classical modernism and new music"". It contains some elements of folk music of the Balkans and Slovenia, functioning ""in the sense of an imaginary folklore"". Draksler has been heavily influenced by Cecil Taylor; whom she wrote a dissertation on.
