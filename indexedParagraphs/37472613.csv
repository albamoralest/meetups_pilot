"Sonny was born on March 5, 1991, in Atlanta, Georgia. He has been involved in making music since an early age. At first he started rapping while at school, but found it hard to get instrumentals to rap over. When he was 13, he was influenced by his older cousin to start making beats. Aside from school, Sonny didn't have other hobbies like playing sports or video games, so he dedicated a large amount of his free time to creating music. Sonny was inspired by famous producers Shawty Redd and Drumma Boy and initially tried to copy their sound while learning to make beats. Eventually his production transformed into his own style.

"When he was 16, he joined a hip-hop group as a producer and was also producing mixtapes for other local artists. In 2011, YC used one of his beats for the single ""Racks"", which went to become a national hit, peaking at #42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and being certified Gold by RIAA. The song was also featured in the Billboard 2011 Year-end Rap songs and R&B/Hip-hop songs charts. Sonny released his first official mixtape Digital History on May 9, 2011. The tape, hosted by DJ 1Hunnit, is a collection of songs Sonny had produced between 2010 and 2011. It features many rappers, such as Plies, Wale, 2 Chainz and Future. It has been viewed over 70,000 times on LiveMixtapes. Sonny produced six songs on Gorilla Zoe's album King Kong released in June. Sonny's second mixtape Behind the Muzik was released on September 8, 2011. It is a collaboration with fellow producer Will A Fool, where each produced half of the songs. In late 2011, Sonny produced Future's hit single ""Same Damn Time"", which was initially featured on Future's mixtape Streetz Calling. Following the song's success, in 2012 Future released a new version of ""Same Damn Time"" as the third official single from his debut album Pluto. It peaked at number 92 on the Billboard Hot 100. A music video for the single was released on April 4, 2012. Sonny Digital also produced the official remix of ""Same Damn Time"" featuring rappers Diddy and Ludacris, which was released on May 17, 2012. The remix was featured on Future's re-release of Pluto, titled Pluto 3D. In March 2012, Sonny produced Gorilla Zoe's mixtape Gorilla Zoe World. The tape was certified bronze for being downloaded over 25,000 times on popular mixtape site DatPiff. In early 2012 Sonny also worked on Gucci Mane's mixtapes Trap Back and I'm Up. On June 8, 2012, Sonny Digital released his debut rap single, ""Business Man"", featuring rapper Que. The song was produced by BWheezy. Sonny produced 2 Chainz' single ""Birthday Song"", which was released on July 24, 2012. Sonny created the original beat, which was later modified by a number of GOOD Music producers – Kanye West, BWheezy, Anthony Kilhoffer, Lifted and Mike Dean. The single peaked at number 49 on the US Hot 100, and also entered top 10 of the R&B and Rap charts. The official music video was released on August 30, 2012, and became a viral success, gaining over 30 million views on YouTube.
