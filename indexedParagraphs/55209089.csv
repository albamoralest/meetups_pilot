"Schlosser was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala to a Dutch mother and Costa Rican father of German descent, who introduced him to jazz and classical music at a young age. He cites opera, musicals and Disney films as his earliest influences. During his childhood, his family lived and traveled between Guatemala, Austria, Panama, and Costa Rica, enabling him to expand his musical vocabulary. While living in Austria, he began singing in choirs and learned to play the piano. After moving to Panama, he began singing in a Swedish choir which sang in Spanish, English, French, German, and Swedish. He began learning saxophone and, after moving to Costa Rica, playing in symphonic bands, youth orchestra, and small jazz ensembles. During high school, he bought the music software Cakewalk Pro Audio and began composing his own music. While graduating from the German high school in Costa Rica, Schlosser wrote a song inspired by Pat Metheny Group. The Latin Grammy Award-winning world music group Editus, who was recording an album with songs by Costa Rican composers, included Schlosser's work in their album Calle Del Viento. He attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston on a partial scholarship, where he completed a double major in Film Scoring and Music Production and Engineering. He then relocated to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film composition.
