"Duffy is the founder, primary songwriter, and only permanent member of the Los Angeles-based band Hand Habits. Their first release as Hand Habits was a 2012 split record titled Small Shifts (included as part of the pinky demos). On September 25, 2015, Hand Habits released double EPs titled This Sounds Like Nothing Tonight and This Sounds Like Nothing Before. Their first full length record Wildly Idle (Humble Before the Void) was released by Woodsist Records in 2017. Wildy Idle was self-produced by Duffy and recorded partially in Saugerties, New York and partially at their home in Highland Park. Kevin Morby said about the album: ""Wildly Idle feels incredibly intimate, like a secret between her and the listener. It hits soft, like warm water, and before you know it it is all around you – a bath, and Meg's whisper has made its way inside you"". In reviewing the album for Pitchfork, Quinn Moreland wrote: ""Duffy sings of romances come and gone without ever sounding jaded or spiteful; future love promises a mystery, a sensuality that’s open like the road"". On March 1, 2019 Hand Habits released their second studio album, placeholder, produced by Brad Cook in Justin Vernon's Wisconsin studio. Duffy stated that the songs on placeholder ""are about accountability and forgiveness .... These are all real stories. I don't fictionalize much"". In 2020, Hand Habits released singles ""Pictures of Flowers"", a collaboration with Jess Williamson, and ""Comfortable"", a collaboration with Ryan Hemsworth. They released their EP dirt in February 2021, and in June of that same year, they released the singles ""motherless"" and ""no reply"", produced by Luke Temple and Jeremy Harris. Duffy's collaborative project with producer Joel Ford, yes/and, debuted with a self-titled album in July 2021.
