"While some sources give her place of birth as Sinaloa, in a small town called Costa Rica, Beltrán stated in an interview that she was born on U.S. soil. She began her music career entertaining the neighbors whom were her first followers. She has faced various family tragedies including the kidnapping of her brother whose body was never found, the murder of her brother-in-law and was even a witness to her step-father's killing when she was nine. It was in Los Angeles where Beltrán's music career took off when she first stepped onto a professional stage. Under the name Gracielita Beltran, she began recording albums of norteño, banda and mariachi music with local musicians. Four years later, Beltran was noticed by record execs at EMI, who offered to produce her next record. ""Baraja de Oro"" was one of the first singles from the six albums Beltran recorded with EMI. At the 8th and 9th Lo Nuestro Awards, Beltran was nominated for Regional Mexican Female Singer of the Year.
