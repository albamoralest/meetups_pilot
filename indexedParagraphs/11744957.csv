"On the bongos Ralke collaborated with versatile flute and reed instrumentalist, Buddy Collette on ""Jazz Heat"", ""Bongo Beat"".  Warner Bros. hired him for ""Gershwin with Bongoes"" and ""The Savage and The Sensuous "", which is widely regarded as one of the best jungle exotica albums of that era.  He worked with Warren Barker on the music for 77 Sunset Strip and did the heavy musical lifting when Edd ""Kookie"" Byrnes, one of the show's stars, became a teen idol and recorded his one hit, ""Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)"".  Ralke performed similar duties for ""Hawaiian Eye"" star Connie Stevens when she recorded ""Sixteen Reasons"".  Other recordings include Jewel Akens' ""The Birds and the Bees"", and five other gold records. His orchestra backed Sam Cooke on several 1959-1960 songs. Ralke also recorded two hits by Ty Wagner: ""I'm a No Count"" as well as ""Slander"".  In the late 1960s he created his own record company. He collaborated with sound engineer Brad Miller on the hugely successful strings-with-environmental sounds creation, the Mystic Moods Orchestra.

"Working with ""Golden Throats talent"" became a specialty niche for Ralke.  Ralke is credited for convincing non-singers including William Shatner and Lorne Greene to play it safe and stick to narration over a musical background.  Ralke also produced Beach Boys dad Murry Wilson's The Many Moods of Murray Wilson which was not kindly lauded by critics but nonetheless has achieved a place as an important footnote in 1960s music.
