"In the 1950s Leighton co-founded and operated JAC Recording, Inc., a recording studio, and abandoned performing. Years later a friend asked him to practice and record a harmonica transcription of a flute solo called ""Poem"" by Charles Griffes. Never having heard the piece and underestimating its difficulty, Leighton agreed to do it. He produced a studio recording, which motivated him to record a classical music album. For nearly 30 years until his death, Leighton hosted jam sessions at his apartment every Tuesday. He called it ""Tuesdays at Leighton's"". Members included Charles Spranklin, William Galison, Randy Weinstein, Stan Harper, Stanley Silverstone, Gregoire Maret, Phil Caltabelotta, and Rob Paparozzi.
