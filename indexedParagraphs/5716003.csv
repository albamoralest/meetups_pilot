"Halfin was born in London, and originally wanted to be an artist when he grew up. He attended the Wimbledon School of Art in the 1970s where he studied painting. Around the same time he started bringing his camera along to rock concerts, which he could do with no restrictions at the time. He later claimed he became a rock photographer by accident.

"Halfin began his career working for Sounds magazine in the 1970s, shooting various artists on the punk scene including The Clash, The Jam, The Sex Pistols, 999 and The Adverts. After linking up with writers Geoff Barton and Peter Makowski, Halfin moved on to working mainly in the US with bands such as AC/DC, UFO, Rush, Journey, Aerosmith and Black Sabbath.  In 1981 he started working with the new magazine Kerrang!, photographing their first cover and shooting with them for the next 20 years. In the 1990s, Halfin took to travel photography on a casual but obscure basis, but his work would later resurface in an issue of Genesis Publications in 2011. He has toured with many bands, including Metallica, Iron Maiden, Status Quo, Def Leppard, Mötley Crüe, Van Halen, Aerosmith, The Black Crowes, Ozzy Osbourne, Kiss, Soundgarden, Queens of the Stone Age and The Mars Volta.
