"Skiba is a vegan and practices Transcendental Meditation according to an interview with AOL Interface. He said that the clear and calm state of mind it provides has greatly helped his creative process, though initially he believed the ""tortured soul"" mindset was more beneficial. The book Catching the Big Fish by David Lynch caused him to change his mind and he now believes a calm state is more artistically helpful. Matt purchased a membership in The Church of Satan organization back in the early days of Alkaline Trio saying ""to me Anton LaVey was...very punk rock"". Skiba moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2001, though he currently lives in Los Angeles. He has ""Love Song"" tattooed on his knuckles. He is a ""big Cure fan,"" a ""huge Damned fan,"" ""an enormous David Lynch fan"", a ""big Green Day fan"" and a ""really big Nirvana fan."" Skiba is divorced. He is a close friend of Fat Mike of NOFX-fame and served as his best man at his wedding.
