"Pierre Nigro was born in the province of Brindisi, Apulia, Italy but grew up in Hem in the north of France, where he formed the group Carré D'As in the 1970s with his brothers. They released several albums in the 1980s. Nigro then began a solo career under the pseudonym Michael Fortunati, and met success with his first record ""Give Me Up"", released in the summer of 1986. It was a big hit in Belgium, France and Japan. He is particularly well known in Japan, where the musical style Eurobeat is popular, and has released many albums and compilations in Japan alone. In 1987, Fortunati performed at the Tokyo Music Festival and won the Grand Prix award in the Disco & Dance Division. He has also appeared on several Japanese TV shows. ""Give Me Up"" has subsequently been covered by numerous Japanese singers such as BaBe, Yōko Nagayama, Beni Arashiro, Mi, Melon Kinenbi and Nami Tamaki.
