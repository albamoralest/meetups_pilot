"Deva's career started at the age of 11 at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch, Essex. A cover of Ella Fitzgerald's ""Summertime"" was her first performance in a live band and totally unrehearsed; she performed one more time there at the age of 13. Deva went on to write her own lyrics and later recorded a demo on her friend's 8-track console. Her first band was called Mad Dog, a punk group in which she was co-vocalist. She only did one show with the band, in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, supporting the punk band 999. Paul Allender and Dani Filth, founders of extreme metal band Cradle of Filth, would later meet Deva through mutual friends.
