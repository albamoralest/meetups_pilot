"August ""Augie"" Borero Colon (August 27, 1927 ‒ June 4, 2004) was an American musician known for his work as a percussionist in the exotica genre. He came to national fame as a member of Martin Denny's band in the 1950s and was the voice behind the bird calls and jungle sounds of the hit single ""Quiet Village"".  He also recorded two solo albums, Sophisticated Savage (1959) and Chant of the Jungle (1960). In the early 1960s, Colon left Denny's group and toured with his own band known as The Tropicales. Colon was born in Honolulu in 1927 and died in that city in 2004.
