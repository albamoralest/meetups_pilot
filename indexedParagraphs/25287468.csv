"In 2001, Good along with LeTecia Harrison, Ardena Clark, and lead singer Quierra Davis-Martin formed the R&B group known as Isyss. As a group, they achieved moderate success in 2002 with their debut album, ""The Way We Do"", which included the Hot 100 charting singles ""Day & Night"" featuring rapper Jadakiss and their signature song ""Single For The Rest Of My Life"". During their career, they performed the theme song to the short lived BET talk show ""Oh Drama"" and were the spokespersons for ""Got 2 B So Smooth"" hair care products. They were nominated for two Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards and took home one award. Due to poor album sales, they were later dropped from Arista Records, before they could release a second album. Ardena Clark was later replaced by a new member ""Love"" shortly before they broke up, due to creative differences. Their only album ""The Way We Do"" reached # 55 on the Billboard Charts and has sold about 300,000 copies. After leaving the group in 2006, Good and ""Love"" both became members of the R&B trio known as BAD GYRL, which also eventually disbanded. Following her time with both groups, Good decided to focus on acting.
