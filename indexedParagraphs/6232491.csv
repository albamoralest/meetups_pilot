"Her career as a vocalist had begun when she won an Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts contest in 1948 with Someone to Watch Over Me. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s she worked primarily at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm in a variety of opera roles, including Floria in Puccini's Tosca and Harry Martinson/Erik Lindegren/Karl-Birger Blomdahl's opera Aniara in 1959. Dellert has also been the initiator and producer of a few gala shows for particular celebrations, such as the show financed by Sweden's Parliament and given in 1976 at the Stockholm Opera for the wedding of King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia (where ABBA first performed Dancing Queen and she performed O, min Carl Gustaf). and a review at Södra teatern for her own 50th birthday in 1975. At the latter she summarized with a Swedish version of My Way describing her own life till then with lyrics by Lars Jacob; the words were updated by him so that Dellert could use it for her last recording in 2015 for her 90th birthday, produced by Emil Eikner. She dubbed the singing voice of Eva Dahlbeck for the role of Helena in the film Sköna Helena (1951). She participated in Melodifestivalen 1972 with ""Kärlek behöver inga ord"", finishing fourth.
