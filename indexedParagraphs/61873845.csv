"Lage started his musical career in the 90's with the band Arkaes as lead singer and guitarist. Later, he was recruited as a singer for the band Paco Jones with which he recorded the album ""Invisible"" in 1999. In early 2002 he became the lead vocalist of Avalanch, having already worked with them in the past as a roadie and background vocalist. Ramón showed an interest in singing from a very early age, but professionally started when he joined Avalanch, which led him to perform multiple tours in Spain and all around the world. In parallel, Lage also lent his voice to the bands Stunned Parrots and Geysser, working in both side projects alongside former bandmate Alberto Rionda. His voice has often been described as greatly versatile, easily able to switch ""from an aggressive sound to some very calm and very pleasant singing""In 2006, he was the first vocalist ever to receive one of the official Asturian Music Awards, by winning in the category of Best Singer in the first edition of the AMAS Awards. In 2011, he worked as a vocal coach at Derrame Rock School in Oviedo, Asturias.
",2,== Career ==
"Avalanch entered an indefinite hiatus on 2012 after performing two farewell shows in Mexico supporting Scorpions. In February 2013, he was announced as the new vocalist and guitarist for Human, an Asturian thrash metal band he had previously collaborated with. The following years the band went through some line up changes, and then focused on working on their third studio album; the first one with Lage as a frontman and songwriter. After a long silence, in 2016 Human announced the return of their original line up for a farewell tour in Asturias and then disbanded. In December 2016, Avalanch's leader Alberto Rionda unilaterally announced a comeback with a completely new line up. Shortly after, in February 2017, all the rest of musicians from the previous line up, including Lage, signed an official statement confirming they had not taken part in any decision regarding the band's return.
