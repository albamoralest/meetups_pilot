"The family moved to Boston in 1922, then moved to California. In 1925, a fall on a school playground in Los Angeles resulted in paralysis on her left side. Dancing (suggested by a doctor as therapy for her weakened left leg and side) led to professional engagements. Lawrence was one of the first women to swim Lake Tahoe in Nevada.

"Lawrence's dancing led to work in films when she became Sally Eilers' double for a tap dance in Dance Team. Thereafter, she worked as a stand-in for Eilers in other films and gained dancing roles as well. Lawrence made her film debut in the 1924 film A Lady of Quality. She is best known for portraying Mary Roberts in Laurel and Hardy's Way Out West (1937); she also provided the ""high"" voice when Stan Laurel sang ""Trail of the Lonesome Pine"".
