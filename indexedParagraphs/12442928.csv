"Kenner's international fame was primarily as the lead vocalist for The James Gang from 1972 until 1974. He joined the group after the departure of Joe Walsh and was with the band with guitarist Domenic Troiano and later Tommy Bolin. He was also with Domenic Troiano in the Canadian bands Mandala and Bush, both of which had some degree of international success, and sang on Troiano's solo albums. In the 1970s, Kenner was instrumental in launching the career of Lisa Dal Bello. Her first single, ""(I Don't Want To) Stand in Your Way,"" was written by Kenner, and is regarded as one of the strongest songs on her self-titled 1977 debut album.

"Following his time with The James Gang, Kenner worked with a Toronto-based television musical variety show, Music Machine, for approximately two years, after which he worked with Garry Peterson (drummer for The Guess Who) in an unrecorded R&B band, Delphia.  In 1975, Kenner joined the U.S. band, Law, and recorded two albums with them, on the Goldhawke Records|Goldhawke record label, owned by Roger Daltrey.

"Despite his international success as a lead vocalist, Kenner has never released a solo album.  In 1982, he contributed to one half of a six-song EP, Roy Kenner/The Royals, with three songs co-written with and produced by Domenic Troiano. Kenner currently does jingles and voice-over work in Toronto, in addition to performing occasionally.   He has performed at the 2006 and 2007 ""We All Need Love"" tribute concerts for Domenic Troiano, who succumbed to cancer in 2005.
