"Their demo CD-R titled, Get Serious, was released the same year which included various lo-fi one-minute long punk tracks recorded in true D.I.Y. tradition—on a 4-track in a concrete practice space. Notably, their Nirvana cover for Negative Creep and aesthetic of rotating instrument and vocal duties, quickly gained attention by Pitchfork Media and Karen O (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), among others. Following their demo release, they assembled 12 songs onto their debut Self-Titled 7"" LP released in June 2006, and was distributed by Rough Trade and Kill Rock Stars, due to constant support of Tobi Vail (Bikini Kill) who stated: This is the band Bikini Kill was trying to inspire with all that riot grrl stuff. Four girls from Austin, TX playing their own style of punk that sound like equal parts Mika Miko, Lung Leg and Meltdown. Hilarious, true and liberating. This is just as fresh-sounding as those Kleenex 7""s you are hunting for, and it's happening today!
