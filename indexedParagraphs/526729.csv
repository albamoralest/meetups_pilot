"Marks was born in Mount Vernon, New York. A graduate of McBurney School in New York, NY, and Colgate University and Columbia University, Marks later studied in Paris. He earned a Bronze Star and four Battle Stars as an Army Captain in the 26th Special Service Company during World War II. Marks had three children: Michael, Laura (d.2008) and David (d.2009). Marks, who was Jewish, was the great-uncle of economist Steven Levitt. Marks was the nephew of Marcus M. Marks (1858–1934), an important business figure who served as Borough President of Manhattan. Johnny Marks's father, Louis B. Marks, was a leading lighting engineer. His wife, Margaret May Marks, was the sister of Robert L. May who wrote the original story of Rudolph. He lived on West 11th Street in Greenwich Village and is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. He died on September 3, 1985, of complications from diabetes. He was survived by his three children: Michael Marks, David Marks, and Laura Marks.

"Among Marks' many works is ""Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", which was based on a poem of the same name, written by Marks' brother-in-law, Robert L. May, Rudolph's creator.  A television film based on the story and song first aired in 1964, with Marks composing the score.

"In addition to his songwriting, he founded St. Nicholas Music in 1949, and served as director of ASCAP from 1957 to 1961. In 1981, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Marks appeared as an imposter on the December 11, 1961 episode of the game show To Tell The Truth. Impersonating the owner of a herd of reindeer, he did not receive any votes. After the true contestant was revealed, Marks identified himself as the composer of ""Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer"".
