"A memorial volume was privately printed by his friends in 1887. A biographical sketch in The Poetical Works of Edward Rowland Sill, edited by William Belmont Parker with Mrs Sill's assistance was printed in 1906, and his poem ""The Fool's Prayer"" (1879) was selected for inclusion in the Yale Book of American Verse in 1912. Sill was the subject of biographies by William Belmont Parker in 1915 and by Alfred Riggs Ferguson in 1955. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition,  ""He was a modest and charming man, a graceful essayist, a sure critic. His contribution to American poetry is small but of fine quality. His best poems, such as The Venus of Milo, The Fool's Prayer and Opportunity, gave him a high place among the minor poets of America, which might have been higher but for his early death.""
