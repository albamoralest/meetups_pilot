"From the mid-2000s, Obara worked with Marek Kądziela's ensemble ADHD (mit Kasper Tom Christiansen, Piotr Damasiewicz, Rudi Mahal) and the band and Power of the Horns, and also recorded with several of his own projects, first with his own trio Message from Ohayo (2007, mit Krzysztof Gradziuk, and Maciej Garbowski). The music documented there won the jazz competition of Bielska Zadymka for young jazz bands in 2006, and led to his international breakthrough. In 2008 he toured in Poland with Antoine Roney. Manfred Eicher became aware of him and recommended him to Tomasz Stańko, to play for the Tomasz Stańko Special Project and in New Balladyna Quartet. In the following years he continued with his own projects, in addition to another trio with John Lindberg und Harvey Sorgen (Three, 2010), with his Quartet (Equlilibrium, 2011, including Dominik Wania, Krzysztof Gradziuk, Maciej Garbowski) as well as the Obara International (Quartet) (with Dominik Wania, Gard Nilssen, Ole Morten Vågan, Tom Arthurs), with whom he has appeared internationally at numerous festivals since 2013 and has produced several albums, including a production of compositions by Krzysztof Komeda. He was also involved in recordings by Michael Jefry Stevens/Joe Fonda.
