"Luis Enríquez Bacalov (30 August 1933 – 15 November 2017) was an Argentine-Italian film composer who learned music from Enrique Barenboim, father of Daniel Barenboim the conductor of the Berlin, and Chicago orchestras, and also Berta Sujovolsky. Bringing his talent into society he ventured into music for the cinema, and composed scores for Spaghetti Western films. In the early 1970s, he collaborated with Italian progressive rock bands. Bacalov was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Original Score, winning it in 1996 for Il Postino. Bacalov composed significant works for chorus and orchestra. Before his death, he was the artistic director of the Orchestra della Magna Grecia in Taranto, Italy.

"Luis Bacalov was born in Buenos Aires to a family of Bulgarian Jewish origin, but even though he identified as a Jew, he did not practice Judaism. His paternal grandparents were Banat Bulgarians who emigrated to Argentina. His film credits include westerns such as Django, A Bullet for the General, and The Grand Duel, and Italian crime films such as Caliber 9, Il Boss and Mister Scarface. He also scored Fellini's City of Women in 1980.
",2,== Life and career ==
"Bacalov had been nominated twice for Academy Award for Original Score—music adaptation or treatment— in 1967 for Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew, and winning the award for Il Postino in 1996.
",3,== Life and career ==
"In the early 1970s, he collaborated with Italian progressive rock bands such as New Trolls, on their 1971 album, Concerto grosso per i New Trolls, Osanna, on the band's second album, Preludio Tema Variazioni e Canzona released in 1972, and Il Rovescio della Medaglia for the 1973 release of their third album, Contaminazione. Bacalov composed significant works for chorus and orchestra, including his Misa Tango (1997), a work setting a Spanish-language adaptation of the classic liturgical Mass to the tango rhythms of his native Argentina.  The standard Mass text was significantly truncated in accordance with Bacalov's desire that the work appeal to those of all Abrahamic faiths: Christians, Muslims and Jews. All references to Christ — except for the Lamb of God (Latin: Agnus Dei) — have been deleted.  Credo, the third and longest text part of a sung Mass, has been reduced to most of its first strophe and part of the second one: ""Credo in unum Deum, ... omnipotentem, factorem cœli et terrae."" ("" I believe in one God, ... Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth"") plus ""Amen"" at the end.  Misa Tango debuted in Rome with Plácido Domingo as solo tenor in 2000 and was later recorded by Deutsche Grammophon with Plácido Domingo (tenor), Ana María Martínez (mezzo-soprano) and Héctor Ulises Passarella (bandoneón).
",4,== Life and career ==
"Bacalov composed Porteña for 2 pianos and orchestra (given a performance and live recording by Argentinian pianist Martha Argerich at the 2015 Lugano Festival).
",5,== Life and career ==
"Bacalov  composed Cantones de Nuestro Tiempos (Psalms for our Times: The Cambridge Psalms) (2006), a commissioned work with text from the Psalms of David for baritone and soprano soloists, orchestra and chorus, which had its world premiere at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in spring 2006 by the Cambridge Community Chorus (William E. Thomas, Music Director).  This followed the 19 May 2002 U.S. premiere performance of ""Misa Tango"" also at Harvard University's Sanders Theatre (William E. Thomas, Music Director).
",6,== Life and career ==
"Two of his songs, ""The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)"" and ""The Summertime Killer"", were used in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill (2003). Tarantino also used three Bacalov songs from the Spaghetti western era in his 2012 movie Django Unchained: ""Django"" and ""La Corsa (2nd Version)"" originally from Django (1966), and ""Lo Chiamavano King"" from His Name Was King.
",7,== Life and career ==
"Bacalov was the first to write a triple-concerto for bandoneón, piano, soprano and symphony orchestra: Tango Music with Symphonic Proportions.
",8,== Life and career ==
"From 2005 to his death, he was the principal director of Orchestra della Magna Grecia in Taranto, southern Italy. He was considered a brilliant pianist throughout his life. He died in Rome on 15 November 2017 at the age of 84.
