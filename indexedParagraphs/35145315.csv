"Sempre Livre (""always free"") was a Brazilian pop rock band formed in Rio de Janeiro, only by women. The name of the group mentioned a famous brand of a sanitary pad. In 1984, they recorded their first disk, produced by Ruban, the same of the group As Frenéticas. The greatest hit was the song Eu sou free (""I'm free""), composed by Ruban and Patrícia Travassos. The band was over in 1986, but returned five years later with the disk Vícios da Cidade (""city vices""), but only the percussionist stayed from the original formation
