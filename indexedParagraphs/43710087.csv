To reduce the impact of language barriers, the Spanish speaking Maisonave was sent to Amador, Panama, for his 18 weeks of basic training. After training, Maisonave was assigned to the 65th Infantry Regiment (the ""Borinqueneers""), a predominantly Puerto Rican regiment.  Maisonave participated in action in the Korean War for three years. In 1954, Maisonave was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army, and returned to New York City.

"In the late 1970s Maisonave was also a dance club promoter in New York City and worked for Robert Tirado who was the owner of the famous Casablanca nightclub.
