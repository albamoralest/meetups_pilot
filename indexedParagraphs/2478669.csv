"Bernstein is perhaps best well-known for playing the slide trumpet. As he indicated an interview with PostGenre, ""with the slide trumpet, you have complete freedom. Thereâ€™s not really anyone to compare your sound to. And that lack of comparisons gave me the freedom to not worry much about what other people did before me.""
