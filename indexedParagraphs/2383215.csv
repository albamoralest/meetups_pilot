"Bob Nastanovich was born in Rochester, New York. When he was in middle school, his family moved to Richmond, Virginia. He attended the University of Virginia, where he met Pavement's Stephen Malkmus and future Silver Jews leader David Berman. The three moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, living and working together at various jobs in art galleries (as security guards) and Nastanovich as a bus driver/bus terminal manager in New York City and Hoboken. It was during this period that Malkmus reunited with longtime friend Scott Kannberg to create the first (then unofficial) Pavement album Slanted and Enchanted in drummer Gary Young's makeshift home studio. It is also during this time that the seeds for the future Silver Jews (Nastanovich, Malkmus and Berman) were planted.
