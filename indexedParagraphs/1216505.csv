"Her first big success was a performance at 1963 National Festival of Polish Song in Opole where she got an award for the songs ""Karuzela z madonnami"", ""Taki pejzaż"" and ""Czarne anioły"".

"In 1966, she graduated from Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts (however, later she never played any part in a movie). The same year the artist teamed up with another composer, Andrzej Zarycki. The year 1967 saw the release of her first longplay album, Ewa Demarczyk śpiewa piosenki Zygmunta Koniecznego, which proved to be a major success and was later certified Platinum for selling over 100,000 copies. At the turn of the 1960s and 1970s, she travelled extensively around the world to countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, United States, Australia, United Kingdom and Finland. She performed in numerous concert halls, including Carnegie Hall in New York and the Chicago Theatre. Demarczyk left the Piwnica pod Baranami in 1972. Two years later her next album was issued, including some new Polish songs plus four Russian-language versions of her previously known hits. It was released in Russia by the state-owned label Melodiya and sold several million copies. Later in the 1970s she was awarded an honorary award at Opole Festival and Order of Polonia Restituta.

"Her 1982 live album, simply titled Live, turned out to be a big success, achieving Gold certification in Poland. In the mid-1980s the singer founded her own theatre in Kraków. In spite of formal difficulties, it was soon shut down, although it generated interest. In the 1990s her albums were re-released on CD and the artist got a number of awards in recognition of her input to Polish culture. Demarczyk continued to perform live until the late 1990s.
",6,== Biography ==
"She gave her last concert on  8 November 1999 at the Grand Theatre in Poznań and afterwards she completely withdrew from public life. In 2001, a foundation Teatr Ewy Demarczyk was created. She died on 14 August 2020, aged 79.

"Demarczyk's repertoire consisted of demanding, not easily  accessible interpretations of poems. Since her songs are often based on poems of ""classical"" poets, both Polish such as Julian Tuwim and Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński and foreign like Goethe, Mandelstam, Rainer Maria Rilke or avant-garde writers, such as Miron Białoszewski, the genre that Demarczyk is associated with is called sung poetry.

"In her performances, she united both dramatic theatrical expression and vocal art (she was a graduate of both a drama school and conservatory, where she studied the piano). Every song she performed was in fact a short musical drama of enormous intensity.
