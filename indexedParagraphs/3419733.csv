"In the mid-‘90's, Falcone started a solo project, Spaceship Eyes. It began as a synth project, and moved towards experimental drum ‘n' bass when he got signed to Cleopatra Records. The project was included on several drum and bass compilations and released the single ""Cheebahcabra"" on Hypnotic Records in 1997, followed by the LPs ""Truth in the Eyes of a Spaceship"" in 1998 and ""Of Cosmic Repercussions"" in 2000. Three of Falcone's Spaceship Eyes pieces appeared in the 1999 cult rave film Better Living Through Circuitry. Most notably, Mind The Alien from Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship was used as the film's opening track.

"In 1996, Falcone resurrected Spirits Burning. Spirits Burning was one of his first San Francisco bands, for which Falcone played bass and keyboards. Falcone set Spirits Burning on their continuing mission just as the internet began to open up an index of collaborative possibilities that studio recordings and logistics previously precluded: the chance for content-creators to recruit musicians on an ad hoc basis across the ether; musicians they’d have scant hope of playing with face-to-face. In the space-rock community, Falcone has done particularly well out of this approach. A survey of his first 10 years under the Spirits Burning banner throws up some surprising contributors (including Daevid Allen, Porcupine Tree’s Steven Wilson, and High Tide’s Simon House). In 2017, Falcone performed live with Spirits Burning, alongside Steve Bemand, Richard Chadwick, Kev Ellis, Colin Kafka, Martin Plumley, and Bridget Wishart. Falcone played keyboards and also sang lead vocals on two songs.
