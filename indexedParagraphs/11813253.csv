"The band was formed in 1999 after ex-Boys Life member Brandon Butler relocated from Kansas to the Washington, D.C. area and briefly fronted the band Farewell Bend. Originally playing shows under the moniker Vita Bruno, the initial Canyon lineup consisted of members from several influential DC post-hardcore bands including John Wall from Kerosene 454 and Vin Novara from the Crownhate Ruin. The band released their first LP in 2001 on John Wall's Slowdime Records and toured nationally afterwards.

"By the time the record was released, fellow Boys Life member Joe Winkle had arrived in D.C., prompting a lineup shift that saw the departure of Wall and Novara, along with the addition of keyboardist Derry deBorja, bassist Evan Berodt, and drummer Dave Bryson. The self-titled album was picked up and re-released by Gern Blandsten Records, who also released their second full-length, ""Empty Rooms,"" in 2002. Further touring ensued, including an opening slot for former Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt member Jay Farrar, and the recording of a live album for DCN Records.
