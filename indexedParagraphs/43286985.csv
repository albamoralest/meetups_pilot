"Sermon was born on June 15, 1984 in American Fork, Utah to parents Jeff and Debbie Sermon. He is one of five children and grew up a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but has since left the church. As a youth Sermon learned to play both cello and guitar. He was determined to be a guitarist even as a child. His dad had an audio-phile quality amplifier, a record player, and all of The Beatles albums on vinyl, which Sermon enjoyed listening to.  He also loved the sounds of Tom Scholz (of Boston) and his approach to solos.  He attended Berklee College of Music where he double majored in guitar performance and composition, graduating in 2008.  While at Berklee he was part of a five-guitar jazz fusion ensemble called The Eclectic Electrics.
