"Kraviz was born and raised in Irkutsk, Siberia, Russia. She moved to Moscow to study dentistry  where she later gained her residency. Kraviz also worked in a number of roles in the early 2000s before her music career took off, including fixing ""cosmonauts' teeth"", hosting a local Irkutsk radio show, writing for a fanzine, and held a club residency on Friday nights. In 2005, she was accepted into the Red Bull Music Academy in Seattle, however couldn't attend as she couldn't obtain a visa, attending the following year in Melbourne instead. By 2008 she was playing a regular night at the Propaganda Club in Moscow. Kraviz released her self-titled debut album in February 2012 through the Rekids record label, to mixed-positive reviews. Kraviz started her own record label in 2014, named трип (English: Trip). She mixed the forty-eighth DJ-Kicks mix album, which was released in January 2015. She took part in writing the music for the 2020 game Cyberpunk 2077. She also voiced her cameo in the game itself, in Russian and English versions.
