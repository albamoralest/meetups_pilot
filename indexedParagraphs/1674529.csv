"Patrick Brown was born in Savannah, Georgia on January 24, 1970. Besides production work, Brown also records as an artist himself, both for his own recordings (including his 2004 single ""I Can't Wait"" from the Barbershop 2: Back in Business film soundtrack), and on songs with collaborators such as Beyoncé and Big Boi (on the latter's US No. 1 and UK No. 7 hit ""The Way You Move""). Brown independently released his debut solo album, Sleepy's Theme – The Vinyl Room in 1998. He was slated to release an album on the DreamWorks Records label called 'For the Grown and Sexy', but the release was scrapped when DreamWorks label folded. He is now signed to Big Boi's label Purple Ribbon Records and released his second album, Mr. Brown on October 3, 2006. Brown is the son of Jimmy Brown, the lead vocalist and saxophonist for the 1970s funk band, Brick.
