"The Devotions were a female group from New York. They had recorded for the Colossus Records. As reported in the June 19, 1971 edition of Billboard, they were to be exclusively with the Silver Dollar Label, which was owned by Paul Kyser. The single ""Dawning Of Love"" bw ""So Glad You're Home"" which they recorded for Colossus was written By Kyser as well as co-produced by him and Tom Vetri. Henrietta Young, Bertha Addison and Madge Quince are credited with composing ""Stuck To You Like A Magnet"". Retta Young's first Devotions recording was ""The Saga Of Will-E Jones"" which was released in 1971. It was composed by Paul Kyser and Tom Vetri, and released on the Silver Dollar Records label. The single ""Dawning Of Love"" bw ""So Glad You're Home"" predates that release. It was released in 1970. This suggests that Retta Young didn't sing on the earlier release.

"An early member of the group was Rhonda Franklin. She left the group at some stage and the line-up consisted of Phillis  Harris and her sister, and another lady called Arnita.  At that time the group were with Symbol Records and their personal management was by Kay-Vee productions. Somewhere between the group changing from The Superbs to The Devotions, the line up changed and Henrietta Young, Bertha Addison and Madge Quince replaced the previous line up. Later on Paul Kyser used a different line-up of girl singers to perform as Devotion.
