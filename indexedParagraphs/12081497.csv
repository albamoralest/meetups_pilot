"Atrox is a Norwegian avant-garde metal band from Trondheim. The group originally formed under the name ""Suffocation"" but soon changed it because of numerous other bands with the same name. Formed in 1988, the band released its first material only in 1997, and followed it with two releases on notable French metal label, Season of Mist. While their early releases are firmly rooted in death metal, later releases incorporate more progressive elements.
