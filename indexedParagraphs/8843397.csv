"Terry Brown is referred to fondly by the band Rush as ""Broon"" in the liner notes for their albums. This nickname appears in the title of the instrumental piece ""Broon's Bane"" from their live album Exit...Stage Left. On this same record, Geddy Lee jokingly introduces the song ""Jacob's Ladder"" as having been written by ""T. C. Broonsie"", another reference to Brown and a pun on the name of Big Bill Broonzy. He also appears as the uncredited voice of the hypnotist on the Dream Theater album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory.
