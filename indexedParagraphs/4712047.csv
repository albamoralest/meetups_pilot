",4,== Beginnings ==

She sang on Jack's Mannequin's album ""The Glass Passenger"" on the tracks ""Crashin'"" and ""Spinning"".

Her music video ""Touch & Go"", directed by 8112 Studios, was premiered exclusively through Absolute Punk "".

",6,== Beginnings ==
"On November 22, Clark independently released 'Patterns' on her label One Small Instrument Records. Buffalo News reviewed it as having ""Dreamy pop with folk roots.  Clark is the genuine article, a deeply talented songwriter and record maker with a gorgeous voice. 'Patterns' is beautifully produced, and is crammed full of deft, subtle harmonic and sonic touches. Smart, sexy, and sometimes, simply sublime."" ITunes reviewed it as ""overflowing with all kinds of charm. The opener, ""Lose My Mind,"" sets the tone with a perfect blend of indie and pop, as retro-sounding synthesizers work their way around percolating beats while Clark's cooing vocals melt over a catchy chorus. The following ""Days into Nights"" is less busy; it gives Clark plenty of room to stretch her vocal range, especially in the wide-open refrain where her notes soar outward. Old-school drum and bass textures pepper the comforting ""Sign,"" where her breathy inflections wash over the listener. The innovatively arranged ""Decimals and Music Notes"" moves with unpredictable changes that rub against the grain of her smooth and simple vocal style. It's refreshing to hear a songstress confidently come into her own style, most noticeably in ""Breathe,"" where the sole accompaniment of an acoustic guitar really lets you home in on her lovely voice."". In 2012, Clark took home the 'Best Singer-Songwriter Award' for Artists in Music held in Los Angeles at the Key Club. Artists in Music Awards – All indie music. In July, she opened for Eddie Money at the Molson Lockport Canal Series in Lockport, NY and August for Roger Hodgson of Supertramp at Artpark.
