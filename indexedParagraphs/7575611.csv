"Originally from Wenonah, New Jersey, Christinzio relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, in 2003. He soon signed a record deal with One Little Indian and established himself on the city's live music scene. He played live with members of The War on Drugs and appeared as a session piano player on Sharon Van Etten's 2011 album ""Epic"" among other collaborations.
",3,== Biography ==
"On the One Little Indian label, Christinzio released two albums, one in 2005 and another in 2007. They were critically well received, but did not succeed commercially. He was dropped by the label and nearly quit music altogether while struggling with mental health issues, drugs, and alcohol. Christinzio relocated to Manchester, England in 2012, following the advice of a fan on social media. There he recuperated and returned to writing and performing. In October 2014 Bella Union announced it will be releasing BC Camplight's already-recorded third album, How to Die in the North, in January 2015. However, in early 2015 Christinzio overstayed his visa permissions due to a severe leg injury and was made to leave the UK, resulting in the cancellation of his band's summer tour which was to include performances at the Green Man and End of the Road festivals and an appearance on Later... with Jools Holland. Gigs in other countries went ahead as planned, including a debut tour in the US. Christinzio has since temporarily resided in Paris and Philadelphia. BC Camplight toured the West Coast of America for the first time in the spring of 2016. He has since re-settled in Manchester with an Italian passport, care of his grandparents. In 2017 Christinzio recorded a new album, Deportation Blues, released on Bella Union in summer 2018.

",5,== Biography ==
"In 2020 Christinzio released his fifth album, Shortly After Takeoff, released on Bella Union in April 2020. It marked the completion of his so called 'Manchester Trilogy' which also includes his previous two albums released on Bella Union. It became Christinzio's most commercial and critically successful record to date with The Guardian calling it ""A Masterpiece"".
