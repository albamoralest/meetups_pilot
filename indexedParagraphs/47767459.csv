"Born in Anaheim, California Shanell was raised in Massachusetts and is the older sister of recording artist D. Woods. Her introduction to music was from her father, a Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor. A classically trained dancer in the disciplines of Jazz, ballet and modern dance, she began her career as a music video dancer for artists like Ciara. Dancing by day, Shanell penned songs by night to production from Iowa producer and friend Bangladesh, garnering a name for herself as a songwriter. As a principal dancer for Ne-Yo, who later signed her to his publishing company, Shanell headed out on tour where she continued to record and hone her writing skills, penning songs for Danity Kane, Ne-Yo, Melanie Fiona, Kelis and Jennifer Hudson. She was introduced to Lil Wayne, who offered her a slot on his Young Money Entertainment roster, creative control of her projects, and the opportunity to join him on stage during his I Am Music Tour. Shanell was also on the 40-city I Am Music II Tour with Lil Boo, Lloyd, Kidd Kidd, Kevin Kev and Big Dawg Movement which started in Hartford, CT July 13, 2011 and ended in Woodlands, TX September 11, 2011.
