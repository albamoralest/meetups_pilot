"Akifumi Nakajima (中嶋昭文, Nakajima Akifumi) (January 13, 1959 – September 25, 2013), better known by his stage name Aube, was a Japanese noise musician. He had released many CDs, LPs and cassettes since 1991, and was regarded as one of the most important noise musicians working of his time. He did not like to term his work ""music,"" preferring the term ""design"": ""I don't think of myself as a musician or an artist. I'm a designer. I therefore consider my sound works to be designs as well"".  The essential element of his Aube project was that each record was composed with only a single material source, manipulated and processed using various types of electronic equipment. Examples of sources he manipulated include water, fluorescent lamps, voltage-controlled oscillators, voices, pulmonary sounds, the Holy Bible's pages and sounds made with steel wire.

"Akifumi Nakajima was born in January 1959 in Japan. He was interested in sound work since the 80s, but had not released anything until he was asked to create music for an art installation in the early 90s. After that, he created an enormous amount of work - most of which was based on one sound source. Anything was used - from glass to oscillators and even pages from the Bible. His early work was noisier, while his later work leaned toward ambient.

"As stated previously, each recording in Aube's catalogue is synthesized from one source sound.  Many of his earliest recordings use water as a source, in either a still form or a gush, as from a faucet or a stream.  Among the most well-known are Hydrophobia (1991, Vanilla, Japan), Luminous (1993, G.R.O.S.S., Japan), Métal De Métal (1996, Manifold, USA), Cardiac Strain (1997, Alien8 Recordings, Canada), Set On (2001, Manifold, USA) and many more.

"Several compilation CDs are of note in Aube's History.

Later compilations of note include Come Again II (1993, Vanilla/Furnace, Japan/USA), The Japanese/American Noise Treaty (1995, Relapse, USA), and Ant-Hology (1998, Ant-Zen, Germany).
