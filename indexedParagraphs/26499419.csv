"Masin was born in Amsterdam. She began to play the piano at the age of 3, and took up the violin at the age of 5. Within her initial year of schooling, she gave her first public performance at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest. At the age of 11, she performed her first recital in Ireland at the National Concert Hall, Dublin. Shortly thereafter she appeared on the popular television program, The Late Late Show. Masin began learning the violin in the class of Coosje Wijzenbeek. Following a move to South Africa, she continued her studies with her parents in Cape Town. Subsequently, she studied in Amsterdam with Herman Krebbers between 1990 and 1996. She has received degrees and diplomas from four countries and her graduate studies were guided by Igor Ozim, Ana Chumachenco, Zakhar Bron and Shmuel Ashkenasi.

"In chamber music, she has had concerts with notable violinists (Philippe Graffin, Jan Talich, Maxim Vengerov...), violists (Guy Ben-Ziony, Gérard Caussé, Isabel Charisius and Roger Chase), cellists (Adrian Brendel, Alexander Baillie, Gavriel Lipkind, Martti Rousi, Alexander Rudin...), pianists Kit Armstrong, Julia Bartha, Finghin Collins, Peter Frankl, György Sebök...), conductors (Janos Fürst and Gerhard Markson), wind instrumentalists (Reto Bieri and Kaspar Zehnder), soprano (Rachel Harnisch), and the actor Hanns Zischler. The pianist Simon Bucher has performed regularly with her since 1997. Masin has premiered works from Raymond Deane, Urs Peter Schneider, Eric Sweeney, Martijn Voorvelt and John Buckley. Buckley's Violin Concerto was premiered by Masin on 21 September 2013 in Savannah, Georgia's Lucas Theater with the Savannah Philharmonic conducted by Peter Shannon. It received its European premiere in the National Concert Hall in Dublin, Ireland, on 3 February 2015 with the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland conducted by Gavin Maloney. Don Li has specifically composed for her, both solo pieces and film music, releasing the works on Tonus-Music Records. Masin established the international, multidisciplinary series In Search of Lost Time in 2004, continuing it in 2010 with a commissioned work inspired by Paul Klee's writings, composed by Thorsten Encke. Festival appearances include the West Cork Chamber Music Festival (Ireland), Prussia Cove (UK), and International Kamermuziekfestival Schiermonnikoog (Netherlands). In 2006, she founded the annual GAIA Music Festival. In 2007 she was appointed Carrick Water Music Festival's artistic director, a post she held for 3 years. As of 2019, she was curating a series called Cocktail für die Musen for Casino Bern, Switzerland. In 2020, Masin created The Exhale, a retreat for musicians, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to move the project online. Masin practices yoga, which she used as the basis for a series of articles for The Strad in 2018, 2020 and 2021. Masin has given violin and chamber music masterclasses throughout Europe, North America, and East Asia. She holds a Ph.D. from Trinity College where she has completed a doctoral thesis examining the similarities and differences of 20th-century violin pedagogy. Her book on violin teaching Michaela’s Music House, The Magic of the Violin, was published in 2009 by Müller & Schade in English, and German in 2018. Masin holds a teaching position for violin studies at Haute école de musique de Genève in Geneva, Switzerland since September 2013.
