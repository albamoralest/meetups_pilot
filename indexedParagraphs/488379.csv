"Tomatito incorporates elements of jazz in his style of flamenco; both, he says, ""emerged as a response to discrimination, a cry of suffering, or the joy of liberation"". Half of what he plays is improvised, he said. He frequently employs the Phrygian mode, and his favorite tuning is D, A, D, G, B♭, D. He plays guitars made by Manuel Reyes, and uses (and endorses) strings by Savarez.
