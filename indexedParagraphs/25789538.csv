"His next act was his neighbor's 14-year-old son. Marcucci's neighbor had suffered a heart attack, after which Marcucci went to help the family. He spotted the neighbor's young son and after the father had recovered, inquired as to whether the youngster would be interested in a career in music. Fabian initially declined but, because his family needed the money, eventually signed on as Marcucci's next act. After two years Fabian bought out his contract. Marcucci was the long-time manager of Hollywood gossip columnist Rona Barrett. He was co-producer of the 1984 version of The Razor's Edge, starring Bill Murray in a rare dramatic role. The following year, he produced A Letter to Three Wives for television.
