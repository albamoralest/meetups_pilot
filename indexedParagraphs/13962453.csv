"Kygo was born on 11 September 1991 in Singapore to Norwegian parents and raised in Tønsberg. He is the son of Kjersti Gjerde, a dentist in Norway, and Lars Gørvell-Dahll, who was working abroad in the maritime industry. He has an older stepbrother Mads, two older sisters Johanne and Jenny, and a younger half-brother Sondre. Throughout his childhood, he lived and travelled with his family in Brazil, Japan, Kenya and Egypt. Kygo started taking piano lessons at the age of six and considers himself more of a pianist than a disc jockey. He stopped when he was 15 or 16 and started producing music with Logic Studio and a MIDI keyboard while watching several tutorials on YouTube. When he decided to pursue music full-time, he was halfway through a degree in business and finance at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, Scotland. He has cited Swedish DJ Avicii as his main inspiration.

The letter ø is usually replaced with letter o in computing. In an interview with newspaper Fanaposten, Kyrre quoted; ""Kygo [as an artist name] has been absolutely perfect. It is very easy to say, in both Norwegian and English. [And] I have no need to change the artist name [in the future]"".
