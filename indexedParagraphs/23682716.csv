The genre of his musical library is diverse, but primarily contemporary (1980sâ€”present day). He has created three full-length promotional CD mixes; Live From Los Scandalous, Homicide's House and LASONIC. All were released under SKAM Artist records, as well as available for download through his websites.

"Bullock was inspired to start DJing after listening to radio station KDAY and was briefly a member of The Alkaholiks. He joined Sugar Ray after the completion of their debut Lemonade and Brownies. His friend DJ Lethal worked on the CD but did not want to perform live with the band so he suggested his friend (Homicide). Bullock went on to join Sugar Ray officially.
