"Born in Kingston, Brown began his musical career in the 1960s as vocalist with Sonny Bradshaw's jazz group, subsequently recording duets with Hopeton Lewis, Lloyd Robinson and Dave Barker for producers such as Duke Reid and Coxsone Dodd. In the early 1970s, he began working as a producer, initially for the Shalimar label, and recorded Augustus Pablo-influenced melodica tracks, such as 1972's ""Merry Up"". He also recorded for Prince Buster, Leslie Kong, and Derrick Harriott. He formed two record labels; Pantomime (or Pantomine), and South East Music, and produced tracks by U Roy, Gregory Isaacs, Big Youth, I-Roy, Prince Jazzbo, Johnny Clarke, Lloyd Parks, and Little Roy. Due to low funds, his early releases were pressed in limited runs, but since became more widely available on various compilations, such as The Way To Mount Zion (featuring material from the 1969–1976 period), and Termination Dub (featuring material recorded with King Tubby between 1973 and 1979). Although he had fewer hits in the latter half of the 1970s, he maintained his profile with hits from the likes of Wayne Jarrett and Sylford Walker. In 2000, Small Axe and Terminal Head remixed Brown's work for a single release that included remixes of fellow reggae artist, Yabby You. In 2002, Glen Brown's single produced by Ras Kush, ""We Dem A Watch"", was the first release on New York's Black Redemption label. In 2010 Brown was admitted to a New York nursing home, suffering from renal failure, diabetes, loss of vision, dementia, and a heart condition. He did not benefit greatly from sales of his recordings, limiting the treatment that he could receive. He died at the Far Rockaway Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in New York City on 4 October 2019, at the age of 75.
