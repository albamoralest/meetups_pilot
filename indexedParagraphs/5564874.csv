"Berger's debut album, Chameleon, was released on 4 October 2004. The album reached number four on the Norwegian albums chart. According to Allmusic's review of the album, ""its ten tracks seem to snatch indiscriminately from rock, dance, R&B, and electro, though the cumulative effect is less of a hodgepodge than a harmonious cohabitation of electronic beats and rock guitars, within a plush, polished pop context, in a manner that hasn't been particularly prevalent (in mainstream music anyway) since the '80s"". The album did not receive an official single release, but the music video for the song ""Lifetime Guarantee"" was awarded a Spellemannprisen.
