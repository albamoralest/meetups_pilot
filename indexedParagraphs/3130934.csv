"Angerfist started making music at the age of 16. Beginning with 4-beat programmed loops and breakbeats, his interest in producing music started to grow. He began his career in 2001 after sending a demo to Mark Vos, also known as DJ Buzz Fuzz, director of BZRK Records. Vos liked the tape and signed Angerfist, who then released his first EPs under the names ""Menace II Society"" and ""Angerfist"". Angerfist soon gained popularity in the ""gabber scene"" because of the aggressive nustyle sound he made. His style is characterized by hard bass drums and vocals sampled from various media, especially films. He already has some hardcore hits to his name, including: ""Dance With The Wolves"", ""Raise Your Fist"", and ""Riotstarter"". His increasing popularity gave him the opportunity to produce the anthem for Masters of Hardcore in 2005, titled ""The World Will Shiver"".
