"Joel Lee Brodsky (October 7, 1939 – March 1, 2007) was an American photographer, best known for his photography of musicians, particularly his iconic ""Young Lion"" photographs of Jim Morrison. In his lifetime, he is credited with photographing over 400 album covers. Brodsky was born in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Syracuse University in 1960.  While working at a camera store in Brooklyn, he began a side career of photography and opened his own studio in 1964. Later Brodsky left the rock 'n' roll photography and focused on commercial work, shooting advertising campaigns for Revlon, Avon, DuPont and other companies.
