"Since the early 1980s Bobcat has been involved in hip hop, beginning in Los Angeles with West Coast icons and pioneers Uncle Jamm's Army, DJing and promoting large dances and concerts for Run–D.M.C., Whodini, Ice-T, and Kurtis Blow, establishing the beginning of the hip hop scene on the West Coast. At the time, Bobcat was only 15 years old and wasn't even tall enough to reach the turntables so they would have him stand on top of a milk crate to DJ. Back then Bobcat didn't own any professional equipment, so when he began working with Big Daddy Productions and Uncle Jamm's Army, Ice T's DJ Chris ""The Glove"" Taylor had to show him how to use the huge Cerwin Vega Mixer.

Bobcat and The Egyptian Lover would take those records, play them first and break them at the big Uncle Jamm's Dances that drew over 15,000 people in the early 1980s.

"Bobcat, along with Uncle Jamm's Army, Greg Mack and Jack Patterson, helped pioneer the world's first 24-hour hip hop radio station, 1580 KDAY, changing the entire format of radio, introducing and pioneering the Saturday Night Mix Show and Traffic Jam. At the time, radio was traditional R&B and was playing very little rap. Bobcat thought of the idea, concept and name ""Mix Masters"" for Greg Mack at 1580 KDAY. The new format caused a national and international domino effect, changing various stations' view of hip hop and subsequently their format.
