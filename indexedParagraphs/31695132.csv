"Tisziji Muñoz (born July 15, 1946) is an American jazz guitarist. He served as drummer in the 440th U.S. Army band. He left the US Army in 1969. In the 1970s, he lived in Canada and New York City. He played in Pharoah Sanders' band. In 1978, he recorded his first album, on the India Navigation label: Rendezvous with Now. In 1984, he moved to Schenectady. He plays in the Tisziji Muñoz Quartet with other jazz musicians, including the Late Show with David Letterman musical director Paul Shaffer. Along with other musicians, he performed at the 150th anniversary of the Steinway & Sons piano company, at Carnegie Hall, in 2003. He uses a single-line playing style, due to a childhood wrist injury. Shaffer, in his autobiography We'll Be Here For the Rest of Our Lives, describes Muñoz as a mentor and inspiration for his musical career.
