"Award for the best interpretation of the IV Symphony of the composer Karol Szymanowski.""Her very start (pianoconcert:IV Simphonie of Karol Szymanowski) showed a beautiful, calm phrase with almost Chopin-like sound, she charmed with her colourful interpretation. The performance tended to a classical form, but was brought alive by articulation motifs, attractive phrasing and a very fresh approach. Beyond any doubt Beata Szalwinska is a very talented pianist which was confirmed by the standing ovation,"": Appreciation by pl:Krzysztof Baculewski
