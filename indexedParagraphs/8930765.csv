"In 1985, he met Darren Wharton who had just left Thin Lizzy and was looking for a guitarist to form a band. Soon after, they started working on demos of songs that actually ended up in the band's first album. The band was complete when they acquired the services of bass player Martin ""Shelley"" Shelton, drummer Ed Stratton (followed by Jim Ross) and keyboard player Mark Simpson (who was soon succeeded by Brian Cox). After gigging for almost a year, they started working on new songs and by 1987 they were signed by A&M Records. The band's first album Out of the Silence was released in late 1988 and proved to be a commercial success. Two years later, they released their second album Blood From Stone. By 1992 Burns had left the band and soon after he joined the band Asia.
