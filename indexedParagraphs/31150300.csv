"Until 2013, he was endorsed by Ibanez Guitars. He is now endorsed by Strandberg Guitars, who in collaboration with him has created the Strandberg Singularity, his first signature guitar. The first version of the Singularity - a seven string guitar with a red and black swirl finish - was released in 2014. In 2021, a new updated Singularity was released in both seven and eight string versions, with the swirl finish abandoned in favor of a sandblasted ash top with a red and black (seven string version) or blue and black (eight string version) color scheme.

"Nilsson primarily plays extended range guitars, though he has often used an Ibanez JEM 6 string to record his solos in the past. Nilsson is a member of the high IQ society Mensa International, his IQ being ""135 or higher"" on the Wechsler scale (which translates to 156 or higher on the Cattell scale).
