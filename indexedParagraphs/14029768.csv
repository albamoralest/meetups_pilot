"Saori Atsumi was born and raised in Iwata, Shizuoka. When she was young, her mother used to sing lullabies to her and use the organ during her kindergarten lessons; this had a lot of influence for her interest in music. She admired Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi and decided to take up the guitar during middle school. During high school, she started to write music. She designed the cover of her self-produced single. Her official site features the cover of her latest single, Namida no Riyū. This became evident when the singer participated in a charity event and contributed a tote bag featuring her artwork on it.
