"Bill Laurance was born on 2 April 1981 and raised in North London, England. As a child he attended William Tyndale primary school, during which he began learning piano and playing with his school band. At age 9 Laurance performed on organ during a school trip to London's renowned live-music venue Union Chapel, a locale he would later again perform at as an adult during the recording of his fourth studio album Live at Union Chapel. Having been trained on ragtime and swing, Laurance first began playing jazz at the age of 14 when he became the resident performer for a small restaurant in the Soho district on the West End of London. As an adult Laurance attended and graduated from the University of Leeds, studying classical music, composition, and performance. During his tenure at Leeds, Laurance met traveling University of North Texas jazz student Michael League, the two going on to perform a number of shows together in the UK. It was here that League and Laurance became close friends. League subsequently invited Laurance to join jazz ensemble Snarky Puppy before the recording of the group's first studio album. With Snarky Puppy's first album The Only Constant releasing in 2006, it wasn't until 2014 when Laurance would go on to release his first solo album Flint.

"In 2019, while touring in Berlin, Germany to promote his studio album Cables, Laurance played a completely improvisational piano piece channeling the emotions elicited by the UK electorate's decision to officially withdraw from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit. Laurance described the decision to leave the EU and the ensuing political events as ""total madness and chaos"", stating ""It's devastating, the prospect, that [he] as a British person wouldn't be part of Europe."" In a related interview with Sam Howson of UK film group Mascot Video, Laurance stated ""Everything is about to become more segregated and divided. I believe now, more than ever, we need to celebrate what we have in common over what we don't.""In a 2019 interview with Band on the Wall, Laurance shared ""I think now more than ever that it’s important to be active about this stuff. There are things I’ve shied away from in the past, but now I feel like it’s part of the responsibility of a musician to raise these things and be more active. It’s passivity that has led us to Brexit, Trump… so we have to be more engaged"".

"In 2019, Laurance released his fifth solo record Cables which was influenced heavily by technology, science fiction, and science fact. In an interview with David Vincent of BrumNotes magazine, Laurance stated, ""I’m fascinated by technology and the speed at which it’s growing and I think that it has to be harnessed in some way. If you’re dealing in any creative world I think technology, and using technology, is an important part, and has to be an important part, of what we do."" Examples of Laurance's passion for science and technology can be found throughout Cables, as many of the songs are inspired, named after, and composed in honour of these subjects. Track two of Cables, entitled HAL, is named after the fictional artificially intelligent (AI) computer HAL 9000, a character in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Track four of Cables, entitled Ebb Tide, was inspired by climate change and the fragility of the Earth's now rising sea level. While performing Ebb Tide at Kölner Philharmonie in Cologne, Germany, Laurance stated ""Climate change is real."" The final and eighth track of Cables, entitled Cassini, is named after the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, whose mission was to study Saturn. The cadence of the song follows the spacecraft's final mission, commonly referred to as the ""Grand Finale"", in which the satellite was deliberately sacrificed in order to maximum scientific output while also preventing biological contamination of Saturn's local moons.

"Laurance has been vocal about his belief in the phenomenon of anthropogenic climate change. Laurance is amongst the musicians and music organisations who have signed the Music Declares Emergency declaration, which calls for 'an immediate governmental response to protect all life on Earth.' During a 2019 concert at La Petite Halle, Paris, Laurance stated ""Climate change is real [...] we have to be more active about it.""
