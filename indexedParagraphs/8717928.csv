"During the repression of candidates for the election of the Moscow State Duma, police brutality was used to hold back protestors and Timati collaborated with another rapper ""Guf"" to make ""Москва"" (Moscow), a song including the chorus ""my best friend is President Putin"", dissing the protesters and Russian opposition movement while praising the mayor of Moscow, the Kremlin, and Vladimir Putin and the video amassed 1.48 million dislikes on YouTube, the highest amount for a Russian video on YouTube before Russian rapper MORGENSHTERN broke the record for a music video for song ""Pososi"". Later, Timati deleted the ""Moscow"" video due to a ""wave of negativity"".

"On Timati's merchandise store, Black Star Wear, Timati collaborated with the Russian Army with military-style clothes but users found near identical clothing being sold on Chinese online marketplace AliExpress being rebranded and price gouged on Black Star Wear. Similarly, the wireless earphones also sold on Black Star Wear that were branded as ""unique"" also were traced back to near identical AliExpress counterparts. Timati then did a brand deal with AliExpress, making a short rap video promoting AliExpress, praising AliExpress for delivery speed and good deals on the website.
