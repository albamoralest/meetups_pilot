"Ekanayaka's debut album of compositions for solo piano composed, performed and produced by her, Reinventions: Rhapsodies for Piano, came out in 2015. It represents the first album of works solely by a composer of Sri Lankan nationality to be released by a major international label.  Each work in the album builds upon a motif inspired by the tonality of the works which preceded it in its primary concert performance and adaptations of melodies belonging to genres of Sri Lankan traditional and folk music. Twelve Piano Prisms, her second solo album of works for the piano, was released on 14 September 2018. Ekanayaka's debut album contains adaptations of 10 of the 18 Sri Lankan Vannams while her second album contains adaptations of the remaining 8 Vannams along with adaptations of indigenous and traditional melodies of Armenia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The Planets & Humanity - Piano Reflections, her third solo album of works for the piano, was released on 14 May 2021. The works in this album correspond to reflections on the eight planets of earth’s solar system and earth’s seven continents and most contain trans-creations of melodies of indigenous peoples of Africa, Asia, Australia/Oceania, Europe, North America and South America, specifically, melodies of the Asháninka, Cree, Gond, Hadza, Numbulwar and Sámi people. She also developed a music composition project from 2012 to 2014. The project aimed to assist war-affected and impoverished Sri Lankan school children recovering from the country's thirty year civil war. Ekanayaka holds a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree from the University of Peradeniya and a Master of Science degree and PhD from the University of Edinburgh. She is a Fellow (FTCL) of the Trinity College of Music (UK), a Licentiate (LRSM) of the Royal Schools of Music (UK) and Licentiate (LGSMD) of the Guildhall School of Music & Drama (UK) which awarded her its Professional Performer's Diploma (PPD) in 1999. She was a member of the academic staff of the University of Peradeniya from 2003 until 2011. Since 2007 she has been a member of the part-time academic staff of the University of Edinburgh. She is ambidextrous and has a synaesthesia, which influences her style of play and compositions.
