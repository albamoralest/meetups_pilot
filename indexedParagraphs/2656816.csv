"Erlandsson was born in Malmö. His older brother is Adrian Erlandsson, the drummer of At the Gates, The Haunted, Brujeria, Paradise Lost and Vallenfyre and the former drummer of Cradle of Filth. They both grew up together in Sweden and started playing drums at a very young age. Daniel writes on the Arch Enemy website: ""We grew up together and used to jam on a little kit in our parents basement, he started first and after some years I started too... He’s been a great influence over the years, and if it wasn't for him I probably wouldn’t be playing today.""
