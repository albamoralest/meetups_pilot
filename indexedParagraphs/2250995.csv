"Wiseman started producing records in the 1980s,  his debut ""Wet Water"" charted No. 4 on CKLN-FM at Ryerson University. Soon he was arranging and recording many friends like Ron Sexsmith, Sam Larkin, Kyp Harness, Sahara Spracklin and UIC. The record he produced for Ron Sexsmith ""Grand Opera Lane"" was rejected by Canadian A&R representatives. Through persistence he managed to get it to Todd Sullivan at Geffen Records in Los Angeles, who eventually gave it to Ronnie Vance in the publishing department which led to a deal for Sexsmith with Interscope. Other notable clients were Kid in the Hall Bruce McCulloch, with whom Wiseman produced and co-wrote much of his Atlantic Records release Shame Based Man (listed as No. 24 on Spin Magazine's top comedy albums of all time). Other artists Wiseman has produced include Edie Brickell, Canadian Member of Parliament Andrew Cash, Knitting Factory Recording Artist Carmaig de Forest, Robert Priest, Anhai, Friendly Rich, Jess Reimer, Katie Crown, Bourbon Tabernacle Choir, Eugene Chadbourne, and Bob Snider.

"Bob Wiseman Sings Wrench Tuttle: In Her Dream (1989, Atlantic Records). The album created some notoriety when the first thousand copies were destroyed by Warner Music due to the song ""Rock and Tree"" which was feared libelous. It was about the murder of Salvador Allende and mentioned Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger and Donald M. Kendall, the president of Pepsi Cola. ""Wrench Tuttle"", the credited lyricist, was a Wiseman pseudonym.  (Wiseman claimed that he set music to words by Tuttle, a poet who would send him lyrics in the mail.)  The album was included in the Canadian music critics top 100 albums of all time  The album yielded the video ""We Got Time"", with cameos by Mendelson Joe and friends, Tracy Wright (for whom Wiseman wrote the 2013 song mothface@yahoo.ca, Don McKellar, Leslie Spit Treeo and Mary Margaret O'Hara. The album also featured ""Airplane on the Highway"" which had an accompanying video by Caroline Azar and animator Lisa Bujoin.
