"Rigels Rajku was born on 27 September 1986 into a multi-religious Albanian family in the village of Sukth, then part of the People's Socialist Republic, present Albania. His father is a Muslim from Dibër and his mother a Catholic from Krujë. In 1997, Rajku and his family fled to London, England, as refugees to escape the war and conflicts in connection with the Albanian Civil War. He was raised in the Woolwich neighborhood of Southeast London and subsequently developed an interest in boxing and street fighting. In 2006, Rajku returned to his native country and appeared on the third edition of Top Fest, as a solo artist with the song ""Jemi OTR"" and as part of his group OTR with the song ""Kështu e bëjme ne"". In May 2007, he collaborated with Albanian rappers J-No and Decee and returned to the competition with the song ""Kur vijm na"". Later that year in November 2007, he unsuccessfully participated with the song ""Veç për ty"" in the 9th edition of Kënga Magjike and failed to qualify for the contest's semi-finals.
