"Ross made his mark on television with writing.  As an ABC executive, he wrote (and directed) the classic opening segment to ABC's Wide World of Sports:
",41,== Television writing ==
"Spanning the globe to bring you the constant variety of sport… the thrill of victory… and the agony of defeat… the human drama of athletic competition… this is ABC's Wide World of Sports!
",42,== Television writing ==
"He wrote a third of the 1960s Batman episodes, and also had an uncredited cameo in one episode in which he played ""Ballpoint Baxter.""  The character had no lines.  Ballpoint was his nickname in real life.
",43,== Television writing ==
"Although most recognized for his work on Batman, Ross also wrote for The Monkees, All in the Family, Banacek, and G.I. Joe. He was the co-creator with Roger Price of the 1977 NBC situation comedy The Kallikaks and also wrote for the show.
",44,== Television writing ==
"Ross was involved in multiple efforts to bring the comic book character Wonder Woman to television.  Having been asked to write an alternative treatment for the Stan Hart and Larry Siegel 1967 proposal, Ross was later approached by producer Douglas S. Cramer in 1973 to write a series pilot.  Ross declined, objecting to the series' updated Wonder Woman character (based on the 1960s and 70s comic book) and the casting of Cathy Lee Crosby.  When the 1974 Crosby pilot failed, Ross was brought in to develop his own vision which put a high priority on visual fidelity to the look of the classic comics.  The resulting Wonder Woman aired from 1975 to 1979.  Ross was instrumental in the choosing of Lynda Carter and Lyle Waggoner as the show's stars.

"In collaboration with Jay Robert Nash, Ross authored The Motion Picture Guide, a comprehensive multi-volume set of encyclopedias written from the 1970s to the early 1980s, containing detailed descriptions of possibly every motion picture made up to that time, with a two-volume index, and a separate volume entirely dedicated to silent films, and yet another listing every actor (and other major creative credit) with that person's complete list of films. The regular encyclopedia editions alphabetized every sound feature from 1927 until 1983, the last volume having a separate section in the back for 1984 movies (and the deaths of that year) that were compiled too close to press time to include alphabetically among the other listings; and starting in 1985 until the early 1990s, an individual volume was released annually, with an obituary section for that year also included. It used a five-star rating system, and was perhaps the most complete single project to catalog every movie until the creation of The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
