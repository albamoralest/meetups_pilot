"Born August 1, son of Barbara and Jerry Lipps, Scott was born and raised in Long Island, NY, where he first enrolled at the Percussion Institute of Technology and would later attend California State University at Northridge.   While in school, Scott also served as the drummer of L.A. band Black Cherry with the original singer from the L.A. Guns, Paul Black.  In 1994 Scott met Mark McCoy (lead vocalist of Outlaw Blood) and recorded a project released on New Breed Records called the New Breed Worship Band with Rick Harchol and Holland Davis. Scott learned management while touring with the band and supplemented his income by working for Lindy Goetz, manager for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Scott suffered a repetitive arm injury that put an end to his rock career. At the suggestion of his mother, Scott started working for a relative that owned NEXT Model Management. Scott then moved to New York City where he founded One Management in 2001.
