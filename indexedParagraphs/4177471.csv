"and Andrew Vowles. At the time he was one of the youngest DJs in the city. In 1986, The Wild Bunch disbanded. Del Naja, Vowles, and Marshall then formed the trip hop group Massive Attack in 1988, which are considered to have pioneered the Bristol Sound along with Portishead and Tricky. Between 2001 and 2005, Marshall was mainly absent from Massive Attack, with 100th Window being the only album he did not have major input on. Reuniting (minus Vowles) for Heligoland and more recent projects, the group divided the production work between Marshall and Del Naja, who each worked on separate songs in their own studios, choosing their own collaborators.
