"Russo's drumming is fierce and complex (he has been nicknamed ""The Madness"" and ""Octo-Russo"" by fans). His Roland SPD-S sampler is often used for electronic drum samples, which play an important role in many of The Duo's compositions, such as ""Welcome Red"", ""Becky"", and ""My Pet Goat"". Two songs appearing on Play Pause Stop, ""Memphis"" and ""Powder"", were written by Russo and feature his guitar playing.
