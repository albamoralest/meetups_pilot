"Smith went to college in Tennessee for elementary education with a minor in music. He became a writer for funk and soul artists such as the O'Jays and The Spinners. In 1972 he would record for Paramount, releasing a single called ""Double Dutch"" under the name Franklin Franklin, but the record failed to become a hit. He was also influential in the careers of the rappers Tone Loc, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg.

"With his 1981 single ""Double Dutch Bus"", released by WMOT Records, Smith popularized a nonsensical form of slang (from his song ""Slang thang"", 1981 WMOT, Records), in which ""iz"" is placed in the middle of a word (for example, the word ""place"" becomes ""plizace""), or the last letters of a word are replaced with ""-izzle"" (""sure"" becomes shizzle).  A type of infix, it found greater popularity later on in hip hop and rap with its usage by Snoop Dogg.
