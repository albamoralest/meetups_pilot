Stephenson went on to write hits for Kenny Rogers, Dan Seals, Janie Fricke, and John Anderson.

"Stephenson landed a recording contract of his own with Handshake Records, through which he released his first solo album, China Girl, in 1981.  He later signed with MCA, and his second album, Righteous Anger, was released in 1984.  He scored big on the Billboard charts with ""Modern Day Delilah"" peaking at No. 22, and a second hit, ""What the Big Girls Do"", peaked at No. 45. Righteous Anger charted at No. 54 on the Billboard 200, but his follow-up 1986 disc, Suspicious Heart, did not chart, nor did its lead single, ""We're Doing Alright."" It also included two songs featured on movie soundtracks: ""Make It Glamorous"" from the 1984 film The Wild Life and ""No Secrets"" from the 1985 film Secret Admirer. Stephenson returned to songwriting duties until the early 1990s, when he became one-third of BlackHawk, a successful country group, through the end of the decade. In February 1999, Stephenson was diagnosed with melanoma and underwent surgery. He left the group in February 2000 to continue battling the cancer, but he died on the morning of April 8, 2001, as a result of the disease.
