After it came the No. 7 ""I Tell It Like It Used to Be"", the first single from his 1986 album of the same name. Counting its title track, this album accounted for four singles: the No. 3 ""I Wish That I Could Hurt That Way Again"" and two straight Number Ones in ""Hell and High Water"" and ""Don't Go to Strangers"". Brown's second album for the label, Brilliant Conversationalist, followed a year later. Although none of its singles went to Number One, it accounted for three more Top Ten hits in its title track, followed by ""She Couldn't Love Me Anymore"" and ""Last Resort"". A third album, 1988's Come as You Were, produced his third and final Number One in ""Darlene"". Then came the No. 7 title track and No. 30 ""Never Say Never"".
