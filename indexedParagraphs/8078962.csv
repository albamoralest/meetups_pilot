"West began his career as the lead guitarist for Toronto-based band The Philosopher Kings in 1994. After achieving some commercial success in the late 1990s and winning a Canadian Juno Award with the group, he began to produce music for other artists, partnering up with Kings lead singer Gerald Eaton to produce Nelly Furtado's debut album, Whoa, Nelly! The project garnered a Grammy nomination for West's production and a win for Furtado, as well as several Juno Awards. Working as a production duo under the name Track and Field, together West and Eaton co-wrote and co-produced Furtado's follow-up album Folklore and two albums with Somali Canadian rapper K'Naan, landing themselves several more Junos. Before long, West branched off into solo production, now producing and writing alongside such notable artists as Maroon 5, Awolnation, K'Naan, Nakia, and Bono.
