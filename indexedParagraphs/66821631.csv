"He is known as a member of the hip hop duo SödraSidan. The band was established as Dalenbarn in 2009 as a duo of two childhood friends Daniel Jutterström (Jutte) and Christopher Wahlberg (Chrippa) both originating from Enskededalenas in southern Stockholm who had been rapping together since the age of 15. Their EP Stället där vi bor was described as ""förortsrap"" (meaning suburban rap). In 2010, they changed the name to SödraSidan based on their single of the same name released on December 22, 2010 together with a music video in collaboration with producer Proclaimer.
