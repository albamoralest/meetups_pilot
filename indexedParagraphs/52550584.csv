"Her earliest works were more traditional canciones, criollas, and dances. In 1940 she began to study under Enrique Casal Chapí, the director of the Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional (OSN) in the Dominican Republic. Lapeiretta de Brouwer continued to compose pieces, expanding to ballets and works for orchestras and ensembles. As director, Casal Chapí often championed native composers and performed their works with the symphony, and Lapeiretta de Brouwer earned exposure both in the Dominican Republic and abroad. The OSN under Casal Chapí premiered Lapeiretta de Brouwer's work Dos Caprichos for wind ensemble in 1942, as well as her orchestral piece Abominación de la espera in 1943 with soloist soprano Dora Merten. In 1944, her string quartet piece Suite Arcaica was performed at a BBC concert in London commemorating the centennial of Dominican independence. Lapeiretta de Brouwer also composed several ballet scores including La reina del Caribe (The Queen of the Caribbean).
