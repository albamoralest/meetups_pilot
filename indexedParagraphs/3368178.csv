"In the 1960s Numminen was known particularly as an avantgarde, underground artist, stirring controversy with such songs as Nuoren aviomiehen on syytä muistaa (""What a young husband should remember""; the lyrics of the song were taken directly from a guide to newly married couples, and included advice on foreplay) and Naiseni kanssa eduskuntatalon puistossa (""With my woman at the parliament house's park""). He was also a member of the band Suomen Talvisota 1939-1940. In his early days Numminen often tried to provoke people. Here he succeeded well, for example by his interpretations of Franz Schubert's lieder, sung with his own idiosyncratically creaking voice, or managing to create a scandal at the Jyväskylän kesä festival of Jyväskylä in 1966 with his song lyrics taken from a sex guide. Numminen also composed music to the writings of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Numminen founded in 1966 with Pekka Gronow the record label Eteenpäin! (""Forward!""), which released Numminen's own music. Later, Numminen's records were published under the umbrella of the legendary Finnish label Love Records.

"Numminen has been one of the unsung pioneers of Finnish electronic music, known for his collaborations with the composer and inventor Erkki Kurenniemi who built for Numminen a ""singing machine"" with which Numminen participated in a singing contest in 1964, and in the late 1960s the electronic instrument Sähkökvartetti (""Electric Quartet""), the performance of which wreaked havoc in a youth festival in Sofia, Bulgaria. Sähkökvartetti can be heard on Numminen's track 'Kaukana väijyy ystäviä' (1968).

"In the 1970s Numminen became a popular favourite with his children's songs in the 1973 film Herra Huu – Jestapa Jepulis, Penikat Sipuliks, where he also played the main role, and in the 1977 TV series Jänikset maailmankartalle, where he played a hare. At the same time Numminen also gained success in Sweden with his song 'Gummiboll' (Numminen's Finnish version of this was called 'Kumipallona luokses pompin ain', and is an interpretation of the song ""Rubber Ball"" by Bobby Vee): Numminen has recorded Swedish versions of many of his songs. He has also made several songs in English, German and Esperanto.

"In 1989 Numminen released a vinyl album, The Tractatus Suite, consisting of extracts from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus set to music, on the Forward! label (GN-95). The tracks were ""The world is all that is the case"", [T. 2] ""To tell whether a picture is true or false"", [T. 4] ""A thought is a proposition with a sense"", [T. 5] ""A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions"", [T. 6] ""The general form of a truth-function"", and [T. 7] ""Wovon man nicht sprechen kann"" (""What we cannot speak about we must consign to silence""). It was recorded at Finnvox Studios, Helsinki between February and June 1989. The ""lyrics"" (quotations from the Tractatus) were provided in German, English, Esperanto, French, Finnish and Swedish. The music was reissued as a CD in 2003, M.A. Numminen sings Wittgenstein. Lately Numminen has made a return to electronic music and modern club sound. In 2003 Numminen started M.A.N. Scratch Band featuring his long-time collaborator Pedro Hietanen with young jazz musicians Olavi Uusivirta, Lasse Lindgren and DJ Santeri Vuosara (also known as DJ Sane).
