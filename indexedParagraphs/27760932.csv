"Bergersen said he moved from Los Angeles to Miami, and then to Seattle between 2010–2014 in the liner notes of his album Sun. The song ""Cassandra"" on the same album was inspired by his then-girlfriend. Bergersen  considers himself a gamer and plays games such as Duke Nukem 3D, Doom, Quake and Hitman: Absolution.

"Bergersen claims to be influenced by musicians from many genres, such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Katy Perry. However, he stated that Gustav Mahler is among his primary influences. He dislikes the concept of music genres, which he thinks limit music to certain structures for the purpose of classification. For this reason he generally avoids following genres and industry conventions and follows his own intuition instead. He draws inspiration from his personal emotions and events in romantic relationships, and anything ""unique and beautiful"" in his surroundings.
