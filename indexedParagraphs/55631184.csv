"Hytta has been training hardingfele with Einar Løndal (1914–2005) and Knut Buen (b. 1948) among others.

Her main project next to playing solo fiddle is in the trio Slagr, initiated by Hytta in 2003. The trio has written and performed two commissioned works, the last, straum, stille (stream, silent), was performed at the Osa Festival in 2008. Their debut album Solaris, was released in 2007, and the second album Straum, Stille in 2011. Slagr received ensemble support from the Norsk kulturråd (Arts Council Norway). Hytta is an experienced performer in international tradition music projects, and has worked with traditional musicians from Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Tanzania, Romania, Hellas, Sverige, Frankrike, England, and Brasil among others. The interest in modal traditional music opened for a scholarship from the Fond for utøvende kunstnere (Fund for performing artists) to study with Ross Daly, a musician and music theorist living in Crete.
