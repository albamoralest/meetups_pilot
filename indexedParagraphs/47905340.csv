"Son was born on February 10, 1994 in Gangnam District, Seoul, South Korea. She was born into a family lineage with interest in arts. Her mother is an art museum director while her younger sister, named Son Sae-eun, pursues a career in the sports industry as a professional golf player in South Korea. She attended Chungdam High School and later transferred to School of Performing Arts Seoul (SOPA), from which she graduated on February 7, 2013. That same year, she was accepted into Dongguk University's Department of Theatre and Film with a major in acting. She was also chosen as an ambassador for the said university in 2014 alongside Girls' Generation's Yoona and Park Ha-sun.

A liquor brand's product also was in need to produce and re-stock on numerous occasions after a photo was posted on her Instagram account.
