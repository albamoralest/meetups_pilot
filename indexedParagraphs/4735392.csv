"In 1980 Klang won a talent contest by the Dutch music magazine Hitkrant, which led to a record deal with the Dutch label Backdoor. Klang recorded two albums, The Pop Theory (1981) and Dots & Dashes (1982). Shortly after releasing their second album Klang broke up, apparently due to the military obligations of some of the members. Klang never had any big hits but got considerable airplay both in Belgium and the Netherlands.
