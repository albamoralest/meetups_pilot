In 1885 she became the Imperial Court pianist in Berlin. She became noted as a mountain climber, sometimes wearing men's trousers. In 1883 she became the first woman to ascend Gerlach, the highest mountain in Carpathians. She lived  in London for a few years, but was deported in 1915 owing to the political circumstances of World War I, because she was the German court pianist. Then, she emigrated to The Hague. In The Hague, she played as accompanist to the dancer Angèle Sydow. She died in The Hague on 9 June 1932. A few days later, a funeral was held at the Jacob Church in Parkstraat and buried at the Kerkkhoflan Cemetery, a newspaper in The Hague reported.
