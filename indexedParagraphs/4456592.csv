"Corrigan was born in Denver, Colorado, and is a graduate of Littleton High School. After playing lacrosse at Middlebury College, he joined Pete Heimbold in Woodriver Bandits. They got together with Chad Urmston to create the band Dispatch. Braddigan bandmates include Reinaldo DeJesus from Puerto Rico, Tiago Machado from Brazil, and Paul Stivitts from New York City.

"Corrigan has made numerous visits to Managua, Nicaragua, where poverty and social injustice are prevalent. He founded a non-profit organization, Love Light & Melody, dedicated to battling physical, emotional and spiritual effects of extreme poverty. Corrigan believes everyone can make a difference. In his own words, “It’s never what you do in life, but the heart with which you do it."" His second studio album, The Captive, draws its inspiration from the band's experiences in Managua. On December 17, 2013, he released his first solo album in six years, titled Someday is Today, which took three years to make.
