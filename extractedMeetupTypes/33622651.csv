18,"Reti is best remembered today for his distinctive method of musical analysis, which he claimed revealed the 'thematic process' in music.",7.022421e-13,7.977078e-06,1.60299e-07,0.9999913,3.3030986e-08,5.85567e-07
19,"His approach did not concern itself, however, with tracing the obvious thematic and motivic 'developments' displayed on the musical 'surface', but rather sought to demonstrate the way in which surface thematic variety is underpinned by a less apparent unity.",7.8864035e-09,0.99774927,2.6606804e-07,0.0007640103,0.00148622,3.9667285e-07
20,"For Reti, ""the different movements of a classical symphony are built from one identical thought"", [TPM, p. 13] and the composer ""strives toward homogeneity in the inner essence but at the same time towards variety in the outer appearance.",1.9297062e-08,0.79113317,1.7279802e-06,0.14487965,0.063961506,2.3945084e-05

23,Reti's way of showing 'maintained substance' would usually involve constructing a music example which juxtaposed a number of contrasting themes; the 'homogeneity in the inner essence' was represented by the notes printed at full size; the 'variety in the outer appearance' would be relegated to small type.,5.0429977e-14,0.9694239,2.3581374e-06,0.030069936,6.7505376e-08,0.0005037208
24,"In focusing on shared features and hidden similarities in shape and contour, the tonal or harmonic significance of the various 'significant' notes in the themes would usually be ignored.",8.7198835e-13,0.9990289,5.7160987e-09,0.0009598289,9.35437e-06,1.8926745e-06
25,So too would rhythm—with the result that Reti's method focuses on relatively abstract 'pitch cells' rather than rhythmically defined 'motifs'.,4.3532043e-07,0.0005489064,1.7634479e-08,0.9994155,6.2063186e-06,2.900515e-05
26,"In addition to admitting inversional and retrograde relationships between cells, Reti also introduced the process of 'interversion', in which the notes of a cell would be re-ordered.",1.5353728e-09,1.4767551e-05,1.1683999e-05,0.9999734,4.7521148e-08,9.406254e-08
27,Reti's analytical procedure is best understood concurrently to the work of other contemporary German analysts of the time such as Schenker and Schoenberg.,6.820536e-05,0.0026383698,0.0001033409,0.99718153,6.058035e-09,8.545217e-06
28,"Like Schenker, and Schoenberg, Reti's analysis of musical works was primarily motivic, tracing the evolution of a musical work from a melodic kernel.",3.1937681e-09,0.9993772,9.318186e-05,0.0005296851,9.829677e-09,1.9559379e-09
29,"The preoccupation the three aforementioned theorists had with such procedure stems from a metaphysical belief that the works of the ""great masters"" (as exemplified in the First Viennese School) were unified thematically often, from a single idea.",1.2853894e-06,0.0013425873,0.014189484,0.205129,0.77933764,2.4149346e-08

31,"Thus in Reti's analysis the ""thematic process"" is explored, in Schenker the analysis takes the form of a reductionist procedure, and in Schoenberg the unity of a musical work from a ""Grundgestalt"" (basic shape) is asserted.",7.249068e-06,0.0013928892,6.535641e-08,0.9980211,0.00057721516,1.4491417e-06
32,"Reti's method, which is to be seen in the context of early-20th-century musicology, has been criticized by the music theorist Nicholas Cook, who regards Reti as having been over-concerned with proving the validity of his method, at the expense of producing convincing analyses of individual works.",3.9885154e-07,0.87898666,6.0131792e-06,0.12090404,3.0726036e-07,0.00010253662
