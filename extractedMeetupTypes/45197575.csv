78,"Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited a period of ""digital prehistory"" to enter a phase of ""data saturation"" through ubiquitous mass surveillance, causing conditions he describes as ""glocalimbodied,"" meaning that local and global forces converge to ""stamp"" the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media.",2.2507791e-10,2.5604033e-06,4.5508036e-06,2.0886792e-09,3.2543154e-05,0.9999603

81,"Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re-envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of ""flexibility"", with inclusion of marginalized traditions, cultivation of both acoustic and digital competencies, and rejection of any ties to ""aesthetic fundamentalism"", techno-utopianism, militarism and nationalism.",3.0483437e-07,3.2963299e-06,0.9999932,2.4638047e-09,6.5896145e-08,3.158974e-06
82,"Music scholars have noted that Hebert ""believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity',"" and that ""Music learned in school should have some connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an ‘embodied practice situated in sociocultural contexts’.""",2.272117e-09,0.00024545842,0.99975365,8.514058e-09,2.7969111e-09,8.214302e-07
83,"An advocate for increased contemporary music, music technology, and popular music in schools, Hebert nevertheless warns that these should not be seen as panacea for poor teaching or inadequate funding and facilities, and that historical traditions – including the heritage of ""classical"" art music – still legitimately require ample space in school education.",7.533085e-07,1.9899926e-05,0.99997914,5.974021e-08,7.908538e-09,1.5125339e-07
