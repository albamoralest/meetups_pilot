15,"Drake's further investigations, almost Sherlock Holmes like in their use of disguise and intuition, led him to suggest that the emblems should be associated with the Buonaparte family and, perhaps, with Pope Clement VII's friend and advisor Jacopo Buonaparte who witnessed and wrote an important account of the sack of Rome (1527).",0.00022022366,0.99799746,0.0017132263,2.5934969e-05,4.315318e-05,4.4572303e-08

17,"The partbooks he analyzed consist of 49 Italian, 24 French secular and 13 Latin sacred musical compositions from early composers such as Josquin, Heinrich Isaac, Sebastiano Festa and Bernardo Pisano and have been essential in reconstructing the lives of Pisano and Palpitine.",1.473081e-09,0.0030823166,0.0012970224,0.99561995,6.8640884e-07,1.393329e-09
18,Drake also suggests that the association with the Buonaparte family helps to explain the geographical disputes that exist due to the partbooks having a Roman binding yet a Florentine script and Florentine paper.,3.061176e-05,0.93169963,0.018261068,0.019361528,0.03064131,5.620694e-06
19,"He makes this further assertion in part because the Buonaparte family was Florentine but Jacopo Buonaparte spent a great deal of time in Rome, in addition to the coat of arms in the partbooks being so similar to those of the Buonapart family.",3.5895826e-07,2.381929e-06,0.98425007,0.0018718636,0.013875286,4.2907753e-09
20,"However, it was widely known at the time that Jacopo Buonaparte was fond of Roman binding, as it was vastly superior to the subpar binding in Florence.",1.7022583e-06,0.027143894,0.0011138691,0.9717268,1.1490052e-05,2.2845454e-06
