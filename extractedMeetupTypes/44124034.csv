13,L-Akkademja tal-Malti describes Meilak as the only female voice among the Maltese Romantic poets who were working during the first half of the 20th century.,7.302258e-05,0.0026311586,3.3307237e-09,0.9750224,0.022270737,2.8056104e-06

15,"""Not only does Mary Meilak stand apart from the other poets in that she does not allude to the existential and historical angst of her time, but also because her form of expression is at its best when it throws a fantastical lens on the world around her.""Prof.",0.00017684672,0.009679944,0.0006567442,0.34568858,0.6437978,4.4976417e-08
16,Ġużè Aquilina and Prof. Peter Serracino Inglott also observe that Meilak had a quick hand and a technically interesting style in that (perhaps unbeknownst to her) she tended to employ the metric found in Arabic poetry rather than the Greek and Italian literary forms which influenced most of her contemporaries.,4.44232e-06,0.104755625,0.088017926,0.7726866,0.03453543,3.0568659e-09
17,"Meilak's verse is known for its ease and accessibility, embracing colourful flights of fancy, a vision of nature as a limitless horizon, religious themes, the use of alliteration and onomatopoeia, and other elements that lend her work the simple and melodious tone that characterizes her poetic identity.",3.5986918e-06,0.86000144,0.016285405,0.030656517,0.09285553,0.00019752838
