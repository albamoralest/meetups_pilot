13,New and/or Critical musicology rejected the idea of the autonomous musical artwork and sought to understand music in terms of its social and cultural relationships.,1.186144e-05,0.08119927,0.56408566,9.765579e-05,0.3298263,0.024779238

16,Kramer’s Music as Cultural Practice (1990) set forth the principle that music takes on complex meanings as a result of its participation the circulation of valuations and practices that constitute culture.,0.0009086365,3.4875717e-05,0.8702977,0.00066314155,9.476275e-06,0.12808628
17,"The book introduced a number of terms, including its title phrase, which passed into common use, most prominently “hermeneutic windows” (pressure points in and around music from which multiple lines of cultural associations extend).",0.0023811194,0.9812269,0.005018884,0.010473005,0.00051912735,0.00038095962
18,"Between this book and The Thought of Music (2016; part of a trilogy also including Expression and Truth (2012) and Interpreting Music (2010), Kramer expanded his theoretical frame of reference to include performance, embodiment, voice,  music in media (especially film), and opera.",0.00017810098,0.032482177,0.9661212,0.0009118501,1.1061621e-06,0.00030558693
19,He has challenged the idea that musical meaning must be derived from musical form and has repeatedly rejected oppositions between  score and performance and performance and meaning.,5.419255e-05,0.8039169,0.020669045,0.17526205,2.6940424e-07,9.75172e-05
20,"He has drawn on speech act theory, deconstruction, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and philosophy, especially by Heidegger and Wittgenstein, to develop a pragmatic theory of interpretation, “descriptive realism,” which asserts that interpretation is a form of knowledge, not merely opinion, first as applied to music and then applied in general.",7.193273e-07,1.1389735e-10,0.99994826,5.096317e-05,7.844308e-10,2.2314853e-11
21,This in turn became the basis of a wider theory of humanistic knowledge that embraces uncertainty and creativity and takes musical experience as its paradigm.,1.027923e-13,6.466349e-09,0.99999905,4.652799e-11,9.589402e-07,3.0273343e-11
