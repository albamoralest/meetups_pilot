41,"I would suggest ... that the true designation of her voice is mezzo-soprano, and any composer who writes for her should use the mezzo-soprano range for the thematic material of his music, while still exploiting, as it were incidentally and from time to time, notes which lie within the more peripheral areas of this remarkably rich voice.",0.8387966,0.0002434436,0.00018893703,0.1607708,1.2061788e-07,1.6637925e-08

43,"This leads to the consideration of one of the most uncommon features of Madame Pasta's voice: it is not all moulded from the same metallo, as it is said in Italy (which is to say that it possesses more than one timbre); and this fundamental variety of tone produced by a single voice affords one of the richest veins of musical expression which the artistry of a great cantatrice is able to exploit.",2.0095226e-06,0.024663396,3.0420042e-06,0.9752763,5.5177145e-05,1.33226905e-08
44,"In 1829 named cantante delle passioni by Carlo Ritorni, one of the most erudite critics of the period,  he described her as such because her voice was directed ""towards expressing the most intense passions, accompanying it with expressions of physical action, unknown before her in the lyric theatre"".",6.2534053e-07,0.00033275964,9.229365e-07,0.99966514,5.190745e-09,5.7149464e-07

49,"Pasta's singularity is measured rather by the tone and extent of the debates her celebrity provoked, by her influence on the operatic stage, and by the timing of her career at the transition from Rossinian opera to the works of Bellini and Donizetti (with all the stylistic ramifications this implied).",0.6666944,0.17061408,2.948812e-06,0.13157976,2.439441e-06,0.031106377
