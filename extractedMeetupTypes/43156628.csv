10,"The practice of music dictation and the participation in popular rites and festivities, allowed Soriano to write down more than one hundred ""Magical Chants"" while also gaining a deep knowledge of that  telluric root which he would years later examine in depth in his works ""Some of the ethno-musicological immanences"" (University of the Republic, Montevideo, 1967) and ""Three Auguric Prayers and Other Chants in  Black Liturgy"", (University of the Republic, Montevideo, 1968), as well as in his chair as professor of musical ethnology at the Faculty of Science and Humanities in Montevideo.",2.5886863e-14,3.3334732e-06,0.9942498,0.005746908,9.108724e-09,3.894369e-09

12,"This immersion into American cultural anthropology had influenced his music which, far from any superficial garment and in its apparent nakedness which may at times become disconcerting, is, according to the expressions of Colombian musicologist Andrés Pardo Tovar, ""a sign of a temperament which, notwithstanding its originality, finds in the roots of vernacular tradition the most profound and true sources of his musical aesthetics"".",0.005007596,0.08300594,0.6418287,0.00014672197,0.010878249,0.2591328
