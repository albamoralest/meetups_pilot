74,"In addition to the experimental and theoretical articles on the effects of a variety of factors (including high arousal and other forms of stress) on music preference and choice (for example, among melodies differing in complexity), he developed a new methodology to investigate the theoretically interesting question of ""hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes"".",3.4873646e-11,0.99971074,9.738997e-09,1.2240459e-05,0.00021537706,6.163445e-05

81,"In 1984, Konečni published an article with five experiments on the ""elusive effects of artists' 'messages,'"" in which ""messages"" were defined broadly to include, in the two experiments devoted to music, the macrostructure of the pieces, such as the original ordering of the movements in Beethoven's piano sonatas and string quartets.",5.509895e-13,0.99986994,2.4585909e-09,2.0184598e-06,1.6376998e-07,0.00012785482

103,"In 2005, he published a theoretical article outlining his ""aesthetic trinity theory"" (ATT), in which ""trinity"" refers to a tripartite hierarchical organization of peak aesthetic responses consisting of: (a) physiological thrills (or chills), the most frequent and transient response, and the least pronounced, yet the object of most experimental work; (b) the state of ""being moved"", considered to be intermediate in depth and duration (the linguistic representation and conceptual structure of this state have recently been empirically investigated by Kuehnast et al., 2014); and (c) aesthetic awe, conceptualized as the peak aesthetic response, exceedingly rare and memorable, and similar to the fundamental emotions in terms of physiological fluctuation, but, unlike them, characterized by existential safety, controllability of danger, and the ease with which it can be ""switched off"".",1.2490059e-10,0.9992755,0.0007220624,1.3422147e-06,5.9489587e-08,1.1372871e-06
