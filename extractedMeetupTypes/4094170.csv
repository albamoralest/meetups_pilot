30,"“In other words I believe that music can be studied not only from the standpoint of musicians and humanists, but from that of social scientists as well, and that, further, it is at the moment from the field of cultural anthropology that our primary stimulation is coming for the study of music as a universal aspect of man's activities.”",1.9674333e-07,0.018038705,0.9689803,3.085259e-06,0.012944445,3.3245036e-05

32,He continued his efforts to arrive at a more accurate definition of ethnomusicology by later suggesting that music was the study of “music as culture.”,5.1578804e-06,6.8076038e-06,0.99885535,3.453835e-05,4.7270227e-05,0.0010508837
33,The distinction between these two approaches to define ethnomusicology lie in how culture is treated relative to the study of music.,6.6618604e-09,2.6590521e-10,0.9999895,2.4969853e-07,4.596379e-07,9.737614e-06

70,Another aspect of ethnomusicology which Merriam sought to make clear in The Anthropology of Music is the overarching goal of the field of ethnomusicology.,1.4128139e-05,0.00024298839,0.3521454,0.073799714,0.14875153,0.4250462
71,"Merriam claims, “There is no denial of the basic aim, which is to understand music; but neither is there an acceptance of a point of view which has long taken ascendancy in ethnomusicology, that the ultimate aim of our discipline is the understanding of music sound alone.”",5.1679035e-06,0.0012660803,0.99847025,2.4578237e-06,0.0002552858,6.606316e-07
72,"This harkens back to the difficulties in ethnomusicology’s past priorities, which were simply the understanding of sound as an object in and of itself, and almost no emphasis was placed on the relationship music had with the cultures it existed in.",1.23056925e-08,2.6516003e-05,0.9932893,0.00068893045,0.004125852,0.001869458
73,"Merriam divides his stated goals of ethnomusicology into three different approaches, the first being the appreciation of the music of other cultures.",1.2428438e-06,3.4953267e-05,0.066499755,0.9247755,0.0071305213,0.0015580083
74,"Many ethnomusicologists, Merriam asserts, are under the impression that the music of many non-western cultures are either abused or neglected, and that they are worthy of appreciation in western society the same way western music is appreciated.",2.027244e-10,0.0007872633,0.99916124,1.7355962e-05,8.435372e-06,2.5608995e-05
75,"Merriam’s second listed goal of ethnomusicology is the preservation of the music of these cultures, a transformative phenomenon Merriam describes as “a constant factor in human experience.”",1.3699298e-05,0.3058045,0.6878597,0.0037456872,0.001270178,0.001306241
76,"The third perceived goal concerns a more general fascination with the use of music as a form of communication among humans, and the study of music in the various ways people use it to communicate will enable a better understanding of human communication in general.",4.0139843e-11,0.0005496247,0.36330226,2.2031486e-06,1.15485726e-07,0.63614583
77,"Merriam’s own take on this perception is stated as “The problem of understanding has not always been well understood…the study of music as a means of communication, then, is far more complex than it might appear, for we do not know what precisely music communicates, or how it communicates it.”",5.6740645e-12,0.0005052229,0.9993131,6.228486e-08,7.3247037e-07,0.00018088699
