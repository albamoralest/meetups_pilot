162,The genius of the rule 2-1-2-1-2 manifests the harp-like lines and also allows the player to discover and play any arpeggio without the burden of questioning the awkward fret board fingering possibilities.,0.3242981,0.0004908221,0.66969556,3.5453133e-05,0.005480041,3.9729883e-08

168,A major milestone for Wayne's students was to experience a mental synthesis of his chord system and the arpeggio structures – revealing the internal relationships that link families of chords.,9.2538485e-08,1.589623e-05,0.011749848,9.693679e-08,0.98823404,8.038465e-10
