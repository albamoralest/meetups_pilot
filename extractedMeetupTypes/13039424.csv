8,Minton's like a little kid who's contact-miked himself playing yo-yo with his saliva; he's a baby drooling through his cries; he's mastered the art of the multiple burp; he's perfected the craft of goobering all over his finger and then running it over his lips while moaning.,5.6775294e-05,0.20991087,4.7199038e-07,0.00021561448,0.7898152,1.0893149e-06
