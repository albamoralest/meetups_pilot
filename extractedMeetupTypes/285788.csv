6,"His one-man shows usually consisted of stories he would tell, often based on the life of his youth in a small town in Limburg, with a typical panoply of family members, neighbours, friends (some enemies), cats and dogs, which he presented in an irresistibly hilarious manner; and interspersed with simple, charming, crystal clear songs about life, love, and happiness.",1.04798e-09,0.98825336,2.766474e-05,6.734091e-07,0.009355394,0.00236281
7,"Subsequent generations of Dutch cabaret artists, and the theater critics of the 1970s and 1980s, were not much impressed by Hermans' unpretentious, politically and socially disengaged entertainment, but his fan base remained very large and his road shows continued to attract very large crowds.",5.9145663e-08,0.9999373,5.475648e-10,1.3385302e-07,1.9995355e-12,6.258975e-05
8,"As was the case for other cabaret artists, the transition from theatrical performance to television shows was associated with ups and downs, and some believe that the most deeply felt and enduring appeal of his shows was lost in the latter medium, but he nevertheless achieved significant successes even on television, his one-man show in 1967 supposedly having been watched by 6 million, that is half the population of the Netherlands at the time.",4.1106832e-05,0.52762747,2.3609336e-07,1.3603815e-06,5.238906e-10,0.47232977

10,"While the second half of the program was the same kind of straightforward, nonsensical humor that had always been his hallmark, the first half of the new show entitled ""Ik heb je lief"" (a deeper statement than ""I love you"", not unlike ""I love thee"") consisted only of songs, in a mixture of simple jazz and French-style ""chanson"", that were tributes to love and, indirectly, to his late wife.",0.0091424165,0.86382025,0.12397977,0.0024342071,2.6721073e-06,0.0006204952

16,"These collection started with simple poems, or rather, rhymes, that were humorous but sometimes contained a more serious note; but later it appeared that Toon Hermans may have tried to create more serious poetry, which was not altogether successful (and perhaps it was not he, but his publishers, who tried to put this spin on things).",1.9052314e-08,0.9999999,6.315023e-08,3.1749508e-08,6.099386e-10,1.1422004e-09
