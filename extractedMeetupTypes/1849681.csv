77,Jaji's second point is that Gilroy does not examine the role that gender plays in black music production.,0.030420743,0.00013912043,2.6330052e-05,0.8229653,0.14640298,4.538461e-05
78,"Jaji discusses how Gilroy's The Black Atlantic, while enriching the collective understanding of trans-Atlantic black cultural exchange, devalues the incorporation of gender into his analysis; she uses as an example chapter one of The Black Atlantic, in which Gilroy says: ""Black survival depends upon forging a new means to build alliances above and beyond petty issues like language, religion, skin colour, and to a lesser extent gender.""",3.71648e-06,0.991198,9.53814e-07,8.464229e-05,0.0075678765,0.0011448973

81,"Gilroy concludes the first chapter of his book The Black Atlantic Modernity and Double Consciousness with the quote: ""social self-creation through labour is not the centre-piece of emancipatory hopes....Artistic expression...therefore becomes the means towards both individual self-fashioning and communal liberation"" (Gilroy, 40).",0.010364249,0.9853795,0.000103492544,0.001745611,0.0009055471,0.0015014379

85,"However, Henriques argues that Gilroy's focus on routes in themselves is limiting to one's understanding of the black diaspora.",3.4208326e-05,0.6922376,6.8449017e-06,0.0009604,0.2772007,0.029560266
86,"Henriques introduces the idea of ""propagation of vibration"", described as the diffusion of a spectrum of frequencies through a variety of media, in his essay, ""Sonic Diaspora, Vibrations, and Rhythm: Thinking Through the Sounding of the Jamaican Dancehall Session"" (Henriques, 221).",5.5175555e-08,6.575019e-08,2.5427673e-06,2.6221025e-10,0.0070448616,0.9929524
