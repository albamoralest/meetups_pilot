17,"Brant's work as an orchestrator was not limited to film and stage: his long-term affinity for the music of Charles Ives — whose The Unanswered Question was an acknowledged inspiration for Brant's spatial music — was ultimately found in the premiere of Brant's arrangement of Ives' Second Piano Sonata, ""Concord, Mass 1840–60"" as A Concord Symphony in 1996.",0.034116577,7.3293035e-05,9.81603e-05,0.9654101,0.0002960952,5.709709e-06
