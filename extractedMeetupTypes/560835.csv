16,"And as a result there is no doubt that Antigona, his 1772 opera for St. Petersburg, was amongst his most forward-looking, the closest he approached the famous reform ideals usually associated with Gluck, but in fact a current that was felt by several other composers of the time.",8.4955514e-05,7.129541e-05,3.2214586e-05,0.9996623,0.00014926192,6.415879e-11
