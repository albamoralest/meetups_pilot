12,"A common feature was the use of dedicated, FM radio quality telephone (0–15,000 Hz range) lines to connect the sound environments of different sites into the same space, a very early example of what is now called ""telematic performance"" which preceded much more famous examples by Max Neuhaus, amongst others.",3.415456e-05,4.4607288e-05,0.54326874,0.3833506,0.00079326495,0.0725086

15,"By using many diffuse sound sources (either not in the space or speakers facing at the walls or floors) she would create the psychoacoustic illusions of sound shapes or ""presence"".",9.333689e-08,0.00015942116,2.718999e-05,0.034433037,3.3967167e-09,0.96538025
16,"Amacher's early work is best represented in three series of multimedia installations produced in the United States, Europe, and Japan: the sonic telepresence series, ""City Links 1–22"" (1967– ); the architecturally staged ""Music for Sound-Joined Rooms"" (1980– ); and the ""Mini-Sound Series"" (1985– ) a new multimedia form she created that is unique in its use of architecture and serialized narrative.",0.0018815267,0.0012475189,0.0002560973,0.99248827,0.0026697672,0.0014567887
17,She was invited while doing a fellowship at the Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by John Cage to work on several projects.,2.8463816e-07,6.983416e-07,0.0011078132,2.8174089e-05,2.8639962e-09,0.9988631

20,Amacher worked extensively with a set of psychoacoustic phenomena known as 'auditory distortion products'; put simply: sounds generated inside the ear that are clearly audible to the hearer.,1.86386e-05,0.42839235,1.3406378e-09,0.5516808,0.01990595,2.2163845e-06

22,"In music, they are most commonly known by the name of 'combination tones','difference tones', and sometimes 'Tartini tones' (after the violinist Giuseppe Tartini, who is credited with discovering them).",1.6497187e-09,0.9980573,0.00081187766,2.689518e-07,0.0011143635,1.6152577e-05
23,"Amacher herself termed them 'ear tones' until 1992, when she discovered the work of David T. Kemp and Thomas Gold and began referring to them by the psychoacoustical terminology of 'otoacoustic emissions'.",3.4778488e-05,0.9992482,1.0657054e-10,5.570292e-06,0.00071141927,2.454066e-08
24,"It has since become clear that some of the sounds Amacher, and indeed all musicians who have exploited this phenomenon, were generating can be attributed to a particular family of otoacoustic emissions known as 'distortion product otoacoustic emissions' (DPOAE).",5.1119154e-05,0.006663129,0.00037738023,0.0010766552,0.9918283,3.4224715e-06
25,"Occurring in response to two pure tones presented simultaneously to the ear, these tones appear to localise in or around the head, as though there were a 'tiny loudspeaker inside the ear'.",1.6697149e-08,0.17603293,9.493537e-09,0.82396233,4.596731e-06,1.2239082e-07

29,"When played at the right sound level, which is quite high and exciting, the tones in this music will cause your ears to act as neurophonic instruments that emit sounds that will seem to be issuing directly from your head ... (my audiences) discover they are producing a tonal dimension of the music which interacts melodically, rhythmically, and spatially with the tones in the room.",0.0010013384,0.0005871275,1.0012948e-06,0.99841046,8.888958e-09,7.265556e-11
