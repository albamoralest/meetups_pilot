20,"While they do not pursue the simplifying approach of Fayrfax (an almost exact contemporary of Cornysh junior, and fellow at Court and Chapel), and remain in a more old-fashioned florid melodic style, they adopt proto-madrigalian manners (for example in the setting of words like ""clamorosa"", ""crucifige"" and ""debellandum"" in the Stabat mater) and have a particularly developed sense of tonal movement (for example, in the Stabat mater, the closing ""Amen"" features deliberate use of F sharps as leading notes to give a sense of tonal cadence into G, or employing E flats at ""Sathanam"" to give a tonal cadence onto B flat, emphasizing the ""strong"" nature of the text at that moment, employing the bass-movement V-I), as well as adopting a more modern sense of the expressive appoggiatura in melodic shapes and in bringing out the stresses of the Latin by such devices (for example, again the Stabat mater, the use of appoggiaturas in the Bassus part to express ""ContriSTANtem et",3.0009387e-05,0.0008237768,0.0023373987,0.99188226,0.004926501,7.920071e-11

24,"It seems that in the examples given above that Cornysh may have been emulating Browne (his own Stabat mater features a celebrated madrigalian setting of ""crucifige"", and his O Maria salvatoris Mater features the exclamation ""En"" (=""Oh"") in a similar way to Cornysh's interjection in his Stabat mater).",1.4040734e-07,0.028698688,0.3027146,0.6685436,3.658756e-05,6.437888e-06
