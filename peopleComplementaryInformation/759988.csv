He was one of Seattle's primary founders. He was an effective civic booster and, compared to other white settlers, a relative advocate of Native American rights. His friendship with Chief Seattle was important in the formation of the city of Seattle, and it was he who proposed the city be named for this important chief. Maynard was Seattle's first doctor, merchant prince, second lawyer, Sub-Indian Agent, Justice of the Peace, and architect of the Point Elliott Treaty of 1855."

In 1911, Hazzard was found guilty of manslaughter in the state of Washington and was sentenced to two to 20 years of hard labor for killing at least 15 people for financial gain at a sanitarium she operated near Seattle in the early 20th century. She was released on parole after serving two years and later, for unknown reasons, received a full pardon from Governor Ernest Lister in 1916. Hazzard died at 70 after subjecting herself to her treatment methods."

Wolfe wrote four lengthy novels as well as many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the mores of that period, filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective. After Wolfe's death, contemporary author William Faulkner said that Wolfe might have been the greatest talent of their generation for aiming higher than any other writer. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac, and of authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains an important writer in modern American literature, as one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction, and is considered North Carolina's most famous writer."

According to the Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok, he was the son of Ragnar Loðbrok and his wife Aslaug, as his brothers Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and Ubba, however, this is not sure to be historically accurate. Ivar is probably the same person as Ímar, a Viking king of Dublin between 870-873. The origin of the nickname is not certain. ""Ívarr beinlausi"" could be translated to ""Ivar legless"", but ""beinlausi"" could also be translated as ""boneless"", since ""bone"" and ""leg"" translates to the same word, ""bein"", in Old Norse. Several of the sagas describe him as lacking legs/bones or having a skeletal condition such as osteogenesis imperfecta, while a passage in Ragnarssona þáttr (also known as the tale of Ragnar's sons) suggest it refers to male impotence."
