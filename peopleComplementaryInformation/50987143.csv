Several of his songs are popular classics in France, including the sea tale ""Dès que le vent soufflera"", the irreverent ""Laisse béton"", the ballad ""Morgane de toi"" and the nostalgic ""Mistral gagnant"". However, with the exception of a recording of ""Miss Maggie"" in English and a franglais recording of ""It is not because you are"", his work is little known outside the French-speaking world."

Upon being appointed to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs for the French government in 1895, he was considered ""the most eminent living chemist"" in France. In 1901, he was elected as one of the ""Forty Immortals"" of the Académie française.He gave all his discoveries not only to the French government but to humanity."
