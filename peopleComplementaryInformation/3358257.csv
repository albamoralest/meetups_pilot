In the late 1960s he was widely known as a protest singer. He recorded over 300 songs, most of which were his own compositions, with lyrics written by Vexi Salmi. Irwin Goodman started as a protest song singer in the folk boom of the mid-1960s; his humorous songs, often mocking the authorities, became favorites of the Finnish people, to the extent that small Irwin singalike contests are still held by some pubs for entertainment. Goodman had continuing troubles with Finnish tax authorities and had ever-worsening problems with alcohol. His escapades were eagerly followed by sensationalist magazines such as Hymy. Goodman died of a heart attack while on the way from Vyborg to Hamina, Finland. The story of his life was turned into a feature film, Rentun Ruusu, in 2001. Irwin's most famous songs include ""Poing Poing Poing"" (1971), ""Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta"" (1976), ""Rentun ruusu"" (1988), ""Ei tippa tapa"" (1966), ""Työmiehen lauantai"" (1965), ""En kerro kuinka jouduin naimisiin"" (1965) and ""Tyttö tuli"" (1978). He won the Syksyn Sävel song contest twice. Common themes in his songs were poverty, taxes, drinking and alcoholism (""Ei tippa tapa"", ""Vielä yhdet"", ""Kieltolaki"", ""Homma käy"", ""Työmiehen lauantai"", ""Rentun ruusu"" - approximate English translations: ""One drop won't kill you"", ""I'll have another one"", ""Prohibition"", ""It's OK"", ""The workman's Saturday"", ""The poor man's rose"") and problems with money (""Raha ratkaisee"", ""Kun ei rahat riitä"", ""Meni rahahommat pieleen"", ""Manu vippaa muutama markka"" - approximate English translations: ""Money is the solution"", ""When you don't have enough money"", ""I failed the money job"", ""Manu, lend me a couple of markkas""). He protested the government with songs like ""Juhlavalssi"" (""Celebration waltz""), and ""Haistakaa paska koko valtiovalta"" (""The whole government can go fuck themselves""). In 1971, Irwin released an album featuring the actor Esa Pakarinen. His 1972 album Kohta taas on joulu consists of Christmas carols. The later songs (""Suruton nuoruusaika"", ""Maailma on kaunis"", ""Ai, ai, ai, kun nuori ois"" and ""Viimeinen laulu"") were often darker in theme than the songs of the 1960s and 1970s."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tax,Tax,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Total-tax-revenues-gdp.png?width=300,,,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8161,"A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national), and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs. The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC. A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labor equivalent. Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common societal, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government. Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs. In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government. This has effects on economic growth and economic welfare that can be both increased (known as fiscal multiplier) or decreased (known as excess burden of taxation). Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic by some, although taxation is deemed necessary by general consensus in order for society to function and grow in an orderly and equitable manner, others such as libertarians and anarcho-capitalists denounce taxation broadly or in its entirety, classifying it as theft or extortion through coercion and the use of force."
